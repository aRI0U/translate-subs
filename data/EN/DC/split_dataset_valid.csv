0.6212121212121212;Even if the culprit placed Tokuzono-san's phone outside the fourth floor window,\Nhow did they get him to fall?
0.35119047619047616;If they could choose different ringtones according to the caller,\Nthey could have set it to some kind of loud noise so that Tokuzono-san would be startled, lose his balance, and fall.
0.3087818696883853;But it could have been set by any of the staff\Nwho were filming on the fourth floor until just before then.
0.3234244946492271;And concerning Onda-san's murder,\Nhe had two cars which he drove on alternating days, correct?
0.27793696275071633;And now, our two-part New Year's Special,\Nwhich we present to you for your enjoyment.
0.5657894736842105;There are cameras in here, and while the security is tight around the dressing rooms,\NI could make it to the room with the locker without being seen as long as I didn't use the elevator.
0.4798387096774194;"Yes! We don't need anything in return;\Njust let me know if you ever need my services!"
0.5625;Say, if the Inspector is there,\Ndoes that mean someone killed him?
0.23739837398373984;He came to pick up Mr. Okida at 8:00,\Nbut he never came out, so he grew suspicious and came inside, only to find him cold in his bed, with his pajamas still on.
0.7331081081081081;I must've picked it up when I held Aslan at Mr. Okida's house\Nand then it fell off here!
0.52;The entire house would become unusually warm\Nand then suddenly cool down.
0.4275132275132275;Why does the famous detective Kogoro Mori have to go to a stupid island\Nwhen he could be spending his time at a flower viewing party?!
0.3584305408271474;He allegedly stabbed his wife and daughter to death\Nand then continued to play the piano as the fire raged on, almost as if he was possessed by something.
0.6172839506172839;Oh, the famous--\NThat's right!
0.41418439716312055;I've always wanted to work on a small island like this,\Nsurrounded by nature...
0.15525606469002695;Including Dr. Narumi, there's six--\Nthe mayor's daughter, Reiko Kuroiwa, her fiancé, Shuichi Murasawa, mayoral candidate, Masato Shimizu, the mayor's secretary, Kazuaki Hirata, and Ken Nishimoto, who we're interviewing right now, but he's really wasting our time.
0.8562460765850597;Excluding Mori-kun and the others, that leaves us with Ken Nishimoto-san, who was the first to find him, Dr. Narumi Asai, who was kind enough to inspect the body for us just now, Kazuaki Hirata-san, secretary to the late Mayor Kuroiwa, Mayor Kuroiwa's daughter, Reiko Kuroiwa-san\Nand her fiancé, Shuichi Murasawa-san.
0.5845511482254697;But the key to the storeroom's back at the station--\NThen go get it!
0.7269681742043551;I'm not quite sure what the deal was, but he was always sneaking around with Kawashima-san\Nat the community center.
0.42418426103646834;Only the 1st and 2nd movements of Moonlight have been played\Nat each of the murder scenes so far!
0.5806451612903226;The suspicious person who ran out of this room\Nwas looking for something under the piano.

0.22790055248618785;But then I won't be sure\Nif the tiger is the right size for Conan-kun's body.
0.4837758112094395;Yes, the culprit probably still has\NSaizu-san's possession that they covered in poison.
0.37254901960784315;I'll run after him,\Nso you circle around in the car.
0.4561664190193165;There was a get-together at the shopping center that day,\Nso most of the shops had their lights off, and there weren't many passers-by.
0.3125590179414542;When you consider she was attacked on her way home\Nfrom picking up something she forgot from her workplace, the victim probably ran into the robber in the entryway.
0.3760330578512397;Well, a Seven-Crowned King\Nprobably would be in high demand for TV and magazine interviews.
0.6277205040091638;If the culprit had taped something to the end of the hose, and used it to threaten her,\Nmaybe the victim fell while trying to avoid it.
0.625;Calling their phones would be faster\Nthan taping something to a hose to make some noise.
0.15050651230101303;Besides,\Nif they'd decided on a signal, they would've brought something to make the noise.
0.48120300751879697;Actually, the culprit\Nthrew the tape at me when they threw the hose.
0.2862190812720848;The part-time worker Mizushina Sosuke-san\Nhad a coin purse, a cell phone, a mask, his house key, and a glasses case inside his jacket pockets.
0.553082191780822;But if they used to work at the same store,\Nshe probably knew when she'd leave for work.
0.49473684210526314;There were signs that someone had tried to break open the safe,\Nbut there was still a bunch of cash inside it.
0.3223684210526316;If they were wearing this outfit,\Nmaybe he thought they were a student in the tournament and let his guard down?
0.3169469598965071;Though even if his nose hadn't bled on it,\Nyou probably meant to spill ink on Nukitani-san's shirt so he'd come here.
0.22006472491909385;Until I saw him ignore the victory pose\Nstruck by Toto Senshin High School's second man during yesterday's team match finals!
0.5;He sees the single truth for what it is,\Nand looks like a kid but has the mind of an adult!
0.6826347305389222;Oh, uh, forget what I said! The truth is--\NIt was a trick.
0.5;"It was probably the only place to hide it;\Nhe couldn't walk after stabbing his leg."

0.5813449023861171;You tried to poke a hole in Mizuguchi-san's balloon\Nso he would drop out of the race.
0.38264580369843526;A-And if he hadn't lowered his altitude,\Nour balloons would've just bumped into each other!
0.5695708712613784;The unfinished pop-up book Kogoro-no-occhan\Nreceived in the mail contained a series of bomb threats.
0.6752411575562701;Inspector, I'd only be getting in the way\Nif I stayed any longer.
0.6441717791411042;The seven stars forming the tail of Ursa Major\Nare known as the Big Dipper.
0.3447251114413076;Damn it. The culprit included the answer\Nbecause he knew we wouldn't get there in time.
0.42152466367713004;According to the forensics team, even when including the bills thought to have burned,\Nthe remaining bills they found in the wreckage didn't add up to the amount that was stolen.
0.5539568345323741;Tomonaga-san, you were standing behind Hirukawa\Nlike an editor guiding a new author.
0.5788113695090439;While the bombs were equipped with timers,\Nthey were all rigged to explode by remote.
0.6437587657784011;To commit suicide, she prepared two types of bathroom detergent\Nand sealed off this room.
0.5005931198102017;But when she tried to produce the gas,\Nshe realized she had bought the wrong detergents.
0.3180428134556575;What I don't get\Nis how she escaped the room sealed with tape!
0.584771573604061;N-No! Since my factory went out of business, the loan sharks had been threatening me\Ninto illegally manufacturing altered firearms, but it wasn't going well.
0.4811529933481153;If he died,\NI'd actually have to work to support myself.
0.5470085470085471;But now that Ryuji-san is gone,\Naren't you next in line to be president?
0.3921232876712329;You shouldn't believe anything she says,\Nalibi or otherwise.
0.4084507042253521;By the way, Tanba-san,\NI heard today's your last day.
0.4117647058823529;While being pulled behind a motorboat,\Nthe rope he was holding wrapped around Ryuji-san's neck.
0.5101404056162246;So if the body didn't wash in from the ocean,\Ndoes that mean it was in the park the whole time?
0.2222222222222222;Without proof,\NI'll never be found guilty.
0.22564102564102564;Tanba-san,\Ndo you still insist on feigning innocent?
0.6159695817490495;And without Eiji-san to put the brakes on the situation,\Nthe worst possible outcome occurred.
0.5074285714285715;The gloves Tengan-san wore while placing the bloodied glasses\Nin Togawa-san's bag that I mentioned earlier.
0.6363636363636364;There's no way they could have jumped the 2 meters to the roof edge,\Nwhich only sticks 10 centimeters out!

0.5007299270072992;Shibata-san was using the money he embezzled\Nto pay for his sick family's hospital bills.
0.1624113475177305;Anaconda Katagiri, the pro wrestler,\NImamura Kotaro, the football player, and-- Anaconda Katagiri-sama once got into a fight with the owner about royalties, at a dinner show.
0.5651720542231491;Through this incident, Okano Rika's plagiarism was made public,\Nmeaning she'll probably never step onto a center stage ever again.
0.6621359223300971;I just went looking for Ran-chan--\NI didn't see anything like that...
0.6204744069912609;But I did see someone strange by the bridge\Nwhen I first got here...
0.5331632653061225;For now, we covered the body with my jacket\Nand left it in the forest...
0.5861244019138756;That crazed murderer who ran off with Chikako\Nbefore our very eyes!
0.49104859335038364;"Yeah, it was probably my sister;\Nthe gas switch and stuff is in the backyard."
0.5632603406326034;Her French recipe book became a best-seller,\Nand there's a party tomorrow in celebration of that.
0.5302491103202847;The thief behind the string of burglaries in the neighborhood\Nwas the resident of this room who got drunk and fell from his balcony, Kitagami Naotsugu.
0.313373253493014;I don't mind,\Nbut please leave once you find what you're looking for.
0.22823218997361477;But, Mori-kun,\Nit's possible the bottles in his apartment had been left out for a while and Kitagami-san had been out drinking.
0.4233576642335766;Mori-kun, you have proof\Nto back up your reasoning, don't you?
0.424408014571949;He was being aggressive,\Nso without thinking, I used the tear gas in the bag.
0.3606102635228849;Not only did you commit robbery,\Nbut you also threw Kitagami-san from a balcony in a childish attempt to hide what you'd done!
0.34864864864864864;You realized from Motoko-san's confession\Nthat you could use her plan against her and murdered her.
0.41946308724832215;Only the stairs from the 9th to the 7th floor\Ncan be used to avoid the security cameras.
0.33568548387096775;Matsuo-san most likely stuck himself out this window,\Naimed down three floors to the room in question-- The victim was shot in the head here.
0.6493738819320215;You left the studio just as the video clip began\Nand came to this 7th-floor storage room.

0.6129597197898424;Old mansions certainly have a unique feel to them,\NI get a chill down my spine for some reason...
0.5983606557377049;By writing while cloaked in Dracula attire as I play Dracula films,\NI've brought many a masterpiece into the world.
0.4881422924901186;W-What makes you think we're--\NEtsuko, let's not hide the truth.
0.5233111322549953;Dorakura was an old acquaintance of my father's, and in exchange for financing the business,\Nhe demanded my hand in marriage after I had just graduated college!
0.6141732283464567;I'd expect nothing less from the head of the Nagato Group,\Nwhich stands equal with Sonoko's family!
0.4073482428115016;We can't be sure until the autopsy,\Nbut he likely ingested poison before entering the pond.
0.6904400606980273;So, he couldn't stomach the idea of losing his dear little sister\Nto his bad friend...
0.5534883720930233;It's the married couple Chief Director Hohoemi Waltz-san\Nand Administration Manager Tango-san that creep me out.
0.6012269938650306;Maybe they have to smile because they're the chief director\Nand administration manager of Smile Village.
0.4324009324009324;We need to make those old hags sign an exclusive contract\Nso they can't be scouted by another nursing home again.
0.4406779661016949;And given the rain and darkness,\NI doubt we'll be able to find any witnesses.
0.7077534791252486;The cause of death was most likely a brain contusion\Ncaused by a blow to the head.
0.5064935064935064;He cut the inside of his mouth,\Nbut he seems to have no other injuries.
0.5498981670061099;When he arrived,\Nyou urged him to get into your car.
0.4508301404853129;After closing his umbrella so he could get into the passenger seat,\Nthe moment he touched the door, you suddenly drove in reverse.
0.4142561983471074;If Tsutsumi-san had been struck\Nwith the note in his pocket, the paper should be more crumpled.
0.376271186440678;The moon's position changes everyday,\Nand I doubt you could specify exact locations with such simple drawings.
0.4925373134328358;I've been looking for the last fish-shaped sign for a while,\Nbut I just can't seem to find it.
0.7430007178750897;These facts, and the fact that some blood spilled through the plastic bag the culprit used to stab the victim,\Nlead to this conclusion.
0.5410573678290214;You may not know, but when you run without a bra, your breasts bounce all over the place,\Nmaking your Cooper's ligaments stretch and droop over time.
0.3116531165311653;Besides, even with back hook bras,\Nyou can attach them in front and rotate them around...
0.42170818505338076;Oh? Those are our--\NIt's just my luck that I'd run into a big incident first thing Sunday morning...
0.31716906946264745;But when I thought hard about it,\NI realized there's also a high possibility the iron girder was dropped from the roof of this building.
0.6217303822937625;This company was originally just me, Fujii, and my sister Kumiko\Nback in my college days.
0.37534626038781166;Yes. Apparently she's the daughter of a wealthy man,\Nand the start-up funds for his new company were supposed to come from him.
0.5630461922596754;Yes. The company president is always checking the monitor\Nto make sure there's no litter on the street in front of the building.
0.5784695201037614;The reason being that I've seen through the superb trick\NNakayama-san used to murder Fujii-san from this room.
0.29645390070921984;Wait. Wasn't she--\NWith so many witnesses, it must've been a suicide...
0.56;I bet she was dead before she fell,\Nand that someone pushed her over!
0.4395491803278688;No, I was told I could pick it up just inside the doorway\Nand to come at exactly 6:30. I didn't actually meet anyone.
0.5641025641025641;We're heating the coffee at the moment,\Nbut what are you trying to do here?
0.706415620641562;Then place that loop around the flowerpot, pull the line to the door while keeping the flowerpot from falling,\Nand temporarily place the other loop around the intercom.
0.4288164665523156;Lastly, close the door on your way out,\Nremove the loop around the intercom, and tie it to the nail.
0.5365853658536586;Next Conan's Hint:\NTelescope.
0.3673469387755102;"Oh, but it says, ""Arrangements have been made\Nthat allow the jewel to be seen clearly from all angles."""
0.23124231242312424;I told you,\Nif we increase the number of security guards around the jewel, he won't steal it in the first place.
0.4139072847682119;Hey, Kid is—\NSh-Shut up!
0.6191222570532915;The question is what to do about that detective kid\Nwith the glasses and the high school detective from Osaka.
0.6014418125643667;Then articles describing how I stopped his crime will be printed in newspapers,\Nand I'll reclaim my spot on the front page!

0.5562599049128367;And if the culprit had prepared a resin gun,\Nthen it means the killing was planned.
0.5174625801853172;First, Mr. Mouth used a knife to make Mr. Pimple hold still during the blackout\NThen Mr. Eyes shot him, making it look like the casino employees killed him instead.
0.3492063492063492;But you're off duty, and without a gun--\NI don't need a gun! He called me out of trust!
0.6593264248704663;Oh, there is one thing we've kept from the media--\Nwe found three sets of fingerprints on the gun.
0.1923509561304837;I already told you--\NYes. Just as you said, even off-duty officers don't know when they might be called in.
0.6142322097378277;Then, anticipating I would suggest going together,\Nhe said he would meet Matsuyama alone.
0.5077720207253886;As we waited for you to come back out yesterday,\Nyour wife looked uneasily up at the upstairs room.
0.5381114903299203;But despite putting on gloves and sneakers,\NKanbayashi-san failed to jump across to the window like he planned.
0.5694760820045558;You look like you exercise,\Nso maybe you were on your way home from the gym!
0.566003616636528;The address and phone number they have on record at the front desk\Nappear to be fake.
0.39148936170212767;So despite having lost her memory,\Nshe instinctually ran away from danger.
0.3692528735632184;In order to keep your hands clean,\Nyou manipulated Kasai-san and made the threatening call.
0.4594594594594595;I did suspect something,\Nbut I didn't realize there was another plot behind it.
0.271251193887297;We chatted for about an hour and a half\Nwhile we drank beer and juice she bought from a vending machine, and then left at around 10:10.
0.46318607764390896;We stopped by her office for about five minutes,\Nand then arrived here at about 10:50.
0.4260204081632653;But I was worried about Kazumi, since she was in bed with a cold,\Nso I came back to check on her at around 7:50.
0.5990510083036773;You didn't seem to notice, but after I got into the passenger seat,\NI dropped a pen from my suit, too.
0.6538011695906433;She threatened to tell the banks and cut off my financing if I said no,\Nso I did as she said.
0.5294117647058824;So you stopped by your office after your drive with Mori-kun\Nto take down that video camera?

0.6690734055354994;Both of these cases were the work of Ogikubo, who carried out the crimes,\Nand a man named Hiroyuki who was working with him.
0.49015317286652077;With the pine branches surrounding it,\Nits silhouette looked exactly like an ogre.

0.34281322059953884;Yes. The killer shot Nanjo-san with a silencer-equipped gun,\Nset up the elevator trick, took the stairs to the 6th floor, and put a tape with a gunshot on it in the stereo.
0.36661341853035145;The killer added fifteen minutes of silence to the start of the tape\Nand used that time to appear in the park as Shinigami Jinnai and lure us to the building.

0.525305410122164;Furthermore, if you leave the right side that we couldn't see open,\Nit's even possible to make Tetsuji-san wave from inside the container without anyone noticing.
0.36072144288577157;You can tell us more at—\NWait! I'm the one who killed my husband!

0.5507060333761232;Yeah. By throwing it on the floor after cutting everyone,\Nthey could make it look like one of the pieces that was broken off then.
0.6478102189781022;There's a hallway connecting the annex to the main building,\Nbut it's being remodeled right now.
0.39767441860465114;It's a bit out of the way,\Nbut we could go outside and come back in through the back door.
0.5132075471698113;His entire left arm is covered in blood,\Nbut there's none at all on his watch.
0.5798611111111112;But it would cause problems if blood dripped off it on the way back,\Nso the killer wiped the watch clean.
0.3564245810055866;This person rushed back to the shrine,\Nput the watch back on the dead body, and then dropped the hat and vest nearby!
0.5086705202312138;I figured you were the one who killed him,\Nso I tried my hardest to alter all the evidence!
0.6717095310136157;Speaking of phones, they received a phone call while questioning Aono,\Nand he was extremely upset.
0.48353096179183136;After unlocking the windows so he could enter from the outside,\Nhe got a rope to hang out of the room.
0.2466091245376079;After tying the rope around the gas pipe,\Nhe passed the ends through the gaps between the ventilation fan above the water heater.
0.5037147102526003;When he got there, his client Takarada Yoichi\Nwas being stabbed by his secretary Shinkai Haruyuki-san.
0.4812332439678284;And she had a man call Koji on the phone\Nto draw him out of the house so he wouldn't have an alibi.

0.513677811550152;You weren't wearing band-aids when you first arrived,\Nbut you were when you returned from the riverbed.
0.4656160458452722;Would someone working in the overly conscious fashion industry\Nwear something with a crease like that?
0.7657766990291263;Taking the stairs to the 8th floor, killing her, and then coming back up\Nwould take at least 4 or 5 minutes.

0.6577946768060836;However, these footprints were made by someone walking\Non both their way into and out of the building.
0.5508771929824562;She then propped Taniguchi-san up in a sitting position\Nand sent her down to the 8th floor.
0.6966292134831461;The evidence left behind included a bent 100 yen coin\Nthought to have been placed next to the body by the culprit.

0.510236220472441;In other words, the culprit used not the strength of several people,\Nbut lifted Hado-san alone.
0.40786948176583493;The best part of the shipping knot is that it can be untied easily\Nsince it doesn't actually create any knots, but if it's done using a brand new rope, then it leaves behind telltale marks.
0.6472573839662448;It was used to pass the rope over the bar by tying the other end to the rope, throwing the ball so that the kite string would pass\Nover the bar on the ceiling, and pulling on the string.

0.421957671957672;That trick involved using a cart\Nso the body wouldn't be found even if the drawers were opened.
0.38808373590982287;So Kisaki-sensei is probably in a place about\Na kilometer from here from which the Toto Tower is visible.
0.30985915492957744;But a senior employee told me\Nshe'd been told the same thing before and not to worry about it.
0.625;Like the employee said, the white sandals\Nwere already there when I entered the changing room.
0.6258503401360545;You're sure you didn't offer to\Nhelp her undress and enter her room?
0.4;I was checking every minute\Nto see if the room on the right was open.
0.6494192185850053;Forensics found scissors, bits of tape, and pieces of a straw in a garbage can\Nnear the changing rooms.
0.24538545059717698;If the victim was already unconscious\Nwhen the killer entered the room, she wouldn't have been able to say anything, and it would've been easy to strangle her.
0.7132442284325637;So Nitsuka-san collapsed a week ago not because of her dog allergy,\Nbut because she smelled the chloroform.
0.7964161274265804;Here's what you did: After making sure the three changing rooms were empty, you placed the white sandals in front of the room on the right, told an employee you forgot where the changing rooms were,\Nhad her show you, and made sure she saw the white sandals in front of the right room.
0.7849829351535836;I-If you keep going—\NWhat?
0.2987220447284345;I suspect your motive\Nis related to Kakura-san's sister, as well.
0.617314930991217;However, the poison on the bills was shaped like his thumbprint,\Nso it was likely his thumb that put it there...
0.45351867940920937;We only found poison on the victim's thumb, several bills,\Nand two other places-- the inside door knob and the lock above it.
