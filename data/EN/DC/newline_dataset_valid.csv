0.5;produce memories a little\Ndifferent from one's everyday life.
0.5;So I'm grateful to Genichi-san for allowing\Nme to make puffed rice at this café.
0.5;So if you could promote\Ntoday's event at school,
0.5;The main event of our café's\NOkuho Mountain Village Festival.
0.5;There was fishing line strung\Nup where the husband died.
0.5;It was at the bottom of a nearby\Nravine, wrapped around a wooden drum.
0.5;It pushed Genichi-san's body out of the thicket,\Nwhile the device itself fell down the ravine.
0.5;When I was in the Organization,\NI heard the name a couple of times.
0.5;I was just wondering if there\Nwas someone named Rum...
0.5;Yeah. She'd talk to me when I\Nwas playing alone in the park.
0.5;"Yeah. While I was on a field trip,\Nthey got involved in a ""robin murder."""
0.5;If this were really a suicide, there would\Nbe a stool or something by her feet.
0.5;there are no signs he\Nleft the room in a hurry.
0.5;All that's inside is the\Nbank's ATM usage details.
0.5;who may have resented her and call\Nthem in for a lineup with this kid.
0.5;They're in the scheduling software\Ninstalled on the computer on the desk.
0.5;This afternoon she met Sakaba Ronbei,\NHabanaka Kuramichi, and Shibakaru Denji.
0.5;Yes. It's written on the notebook in the\Ndrawer and calendar, so it's probably correct.
0.5;She said she was worried so I came to talk,\Nbut I had no idea it had driven her to suicide...
0.5;I hired Komai-san to write a script for\Nthis fall's special mystery program.
0.5;but the script was due, so I didn't\Nhave time to think about it.
0.5;That's not quite an alibi, but\Nit will help the investigation.
0.5;Is there really\Nan empty lot nearby
0.5;But I can't\Nremember where from...
0.5;the stock Watanuki had\Nbought had plummeted in value,
0.5;Besides, skilled as I am, it'd be\Nimpossible to tell, in such a short time,
0.5;Then let's start digging up\Nthe place! I'll go find a shovel!
0.5;But, is there really\Na body buried in this yard?
0.5;No, I just happened\Nto be passing by right now.
0.5;If you don't cut it out,\NI'm really going to get mad.
0.5;I'd only been looking up at her from a low\Nangle recently, so I was starting to forget,
0.5;Conan jumped into the sea when the\Nstrap nearly fell into the water.
0.5;And he kept looking even\Nthough his clothes were wet.
0.5;Are you Kudo Shinichi-kun,\Nthe high school detective?
0.5;and vanished from the window\Nof this 15th floor room,
0.5;Yeah. That blood wasn't there\Nwhen we came here earlier.
0.5;We mixed up the cards because we\Nthought a teacher came to check on us.
0.5;the Osaka Police chief's\Nson Hattori Heiji-kun.
0.5;He's probably having nightmares after seeing\Nlast night's crime scene and moaning in his sleep.
0.5;According to him,\Nafter Nishiki-san was killed,
0.5;he sensed something strange\Nand looked up at the ceiling.
0.5;The police examined it and determined\Nthat only the center of the blood spray,
0.5;I found this paper plant leaf while\Nforaging for vegetables in the mountains.
0.5;I thought if we were surrounded by\Nred, the color would hide it a little.
0.5;They became famous because\Nof that graduation project,
0.5;"I think she also said, ""You just wait,\NDekuri-kun. It won't be long now."""
0.5;This afternoon you'll be free to go\Nwhere you want with your groups.
0.5;If you use a selfie stick at the hotel baths,\Nyou can look into the women's baths.
0.5;How about a place called\NIsogiyama in Ponto City?
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut the world is even more so!
0.5;Like pianos that play on their own,\Nor stairs that increase in number.
0.5;There's nothing we can do.\NShe got married and quit her job.
0.5;Darn it! They're all a\Nbunch of creepy big-shots!
0.5;we would've bumped into\Nthem on our way to the nurse's office!
0.5;I adore my students so much that\NI couldn't get mad at my last school.
0.5;Though in your case, you might\Nhave to fix your nervousness first.
0.5;Then who unlocked\Nthe faculty office door?!
0.5;While the old man was\Nwatching the horse races
0.5;So the elated old man dragged\Nus to Beika Irohazushi,
0.5;But why did the thief leave the\Nstolen pouch in the bathroom?
0.5;It's just the base fare\Nfrom my office to here.
0.5;All that's left is for me to name\Nthem and for them to confess.
0.5;with my finger wrapped in\Na bloodstained band-aid.
0.5;But maybe he happened to see it on the\Nmenu and wanted some grilled fish.
0.5;and the woman who wants to go home\Nto participate in online auctions...
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The\NWoman With White Hands, Part One!"""
0.5;Even heaven is watching the\Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;I'm calling from the Midoridai\NStation police box.
0.5;But Yahagi Emi-san's medical\Nbills were piling up
0.5;The missus was furious that\Nyou sold her a forgery.
0.5;Despite what he says, he just wants\Nto stick his nose in the case.
0.5;I believe she stopped\Nwriting after a scandal.
0.5;The missus put it on him this morning so he'd\Nbe easily identifiable if he escaped again.
0.5;Sayama-san called him the\Nmyna bird with the red yarn.
0.5;He could've arrived at the house\Nby the time the call ended.
0.5;Sayama-san, you're the one that\Nsaid this room stinks, aren't you?
0.5;What a surprise to see you\Nhere, Okiya Subaru-san.
0.5;Right now at this moment,\Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;However, the important Japanese government\Nofficial ignored the village mayor's protests
0.5;and the plans to construct the casino\Nand public bath were put on hold.
0.5;he bought up the forest\Nwith his retirement pay,
0.5;"""Casino and public baths\Nconstruction plans canceled."""
0.5;So why did he spend his retirement pay to\Nkeep Princess Gaga's treasure to himself?
0.5;Do you know if there's a book\Nhere on the village's history?
0.5;It seems the victim Kadowaki Eiji-san\Nwas abusing his mother Yasuko-san daily.
0.5;They said you'd be here\Nif you weren't at home.
0.5;Just like the one found next\Nto the body of the officer
0.5;When no foul play is suspected, the MPD\Nisn't called to investigate the case.
0.5;I was up all night playing\Nmahjong, so I'm so sleepy.
0.5;When I saw the photo of\NYagi's body you sent me,
0.5;Since we drive past this\Nalleyway on our patrols,
0.5;Sergeant Momosaki, who was killed first,\Nwas pointing at a swing set in the park.
0.5;Aono was using his phone while\Ndriving and didn't have his license.
0.5;But that doesn't tell\Nus which of them did it.
0.5;Perhaps her mind was hazy since\Nshe was on the brink of death.
0.5;Really? Sounds like we should ask\Nthe local jurisdiction about that.
0.5;Japanese road signs are\Nbased off English ones...
0.5;Ran and Torahiko are heading\Ntowards the office?
0.5;you visited President Fukamachi\Nin the hospital, didn't you?
0.5;for the murder of Ukaji-san\Nand Director Kiriyama,
0.5;Your security alarm went off...\Ndid something happen?
0.5;They're so sensitive that this\Nhappens once in a while.
0.5;After Izumi-san left...\NYes, at 8:50, the daughter stopped by.
0.5;Chihiro-san arrived at 8:50,\Nand left at 9:10.
0.5;Then Yoshioka-san arrived at 9:20,\Nand discovered the body,
0.5;All other doors\Nwere locked from the inside.
0.5;I was in shock. So I went\Nto my car to get my cell phone.
0.5;But that discussion\Nended with you killing her!
0.5;Oh no! It'll be too late once\Nthe body is taken away!
0.5;In which case, why would\Nthe killer redo her face pack?
0.5;In other words,\Nyou could have done it, too.
0.5;Ridiculous! Are you saying\Nyou believe her?!
0.5;In other words,\None of you is the killer!
0.5;The blood on the table...\NAnd the tablecloth...
0.5;My car broke down.\NThese folks gave me a ride.
0.5;Yes. Everyone is worried\Nbecause you're late.
0.5;Ah! The glass stuck\Nin him is from a bottle!
0.5;That's why there are\Nfragments all over Hotta-san's body!
0.5;Yes. I did hate him.\NEnough to want to kill him!
0.5;That's strange. He would still\Nbe suspected right off the bat
0.5;He died, five years ago. Suicide--\Nno, it was more like murder.
0.5;Sulfur and other chemicals,\Nhidden inside a cabinet.
0.5;The explosive wasn't dynamite.\NIt was a homemade bomb
0.5;Ridiculous! Why would I want\Nto kill the master of the house?!
0.5;and easily-ignited\Nphosphorous in the bomb.
0.5;...the woman's father--\NHotta-san-- was against it.
0.5;I hated my father, too.\NEnough to want to kill him.
0.5;Man, I'm hungry. Oh, that's right!\NWe're about to have breakfast!
0.5;Is Hikone-san the name of\Nthe guy who disappeared?
0.5;And this location is only a\Ntwo or three minute walk away!
0.5;In other words, this is just\None of my usual coincidences.
0.5;break the lock and enter, read his\Nnotebook, and put it into action?
0.5;so they wouldn't have\Nneeded to break his lock.
0.5;I was fed up with my lack of talent,\Nso I've been wandering around.
0.5;Could this be a happy\Nending for you, Funachi?
0.5;Both the victim and culprit had to pass\Nthrough this lot to get to the crime scene.
0.5;According to our investigation, the Gecko\Nmade money working as a street artist.
0.5;I'm sure he did, but the window\Nwas remodeled yesterday.
0.5;If we could explain that one\Nthing, the case would be solved.
0.5;But all three lightning strikes\Nstruck the substation.
0.5;As you know, this morning\Nthe body of a thief,
0.5;Where in the world is he?!\NIt's been two hours now!
0.5;What business does\Na detective have here?!
0.5;He went over to the cottage\Nand hasn't come back...
0.5;I'll pay you twice as much as he is!\NJust keep my affair a secret!
0.5;So that's why I figured\Nyou were into swords.
0.5;Ah! So the killer tried\Nto frame Suwa-san
0.5;Of course. The victim planned\Nto see you today, too.
0.5;Whatever the case,\Nexcluding old man Kogoro,
0.5;Then why did you lie about leaving\Na message on his answering machine?!
0.5;by making the victim\Nhold the sword incorrectly.
0.5;Going early to someone's house\Neven though you know they're not home?
0.5;There is definitive proof in\Nthis room that you are the murderer!
0.5;and switch it with the\Nleftmost drawer of the 5th row.
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;I kept it hidden at the store,\Nbut I'm a huge fan, too.
0.5;Hado had been in here for\Naround two hours writing lyrics.
0.5;during Hado-san's estimated time\Nof death between 4:30 to 5:30,
0.5;We couldn't find it in the\Ngreen room or with his things.
0.5;Since rigor mortis hasn't set in yet, it's\Nbeen less than thirty minutes since he died.
0.5;And the windows weren't\Neven open. Weird, right?
0.5;When the old man screamed, we were\Nall standing in front of this room.
0.5;“What are you doing to\Nmy darling Kazuha?”
0.5;By the way, do those two\Nwriters stay here often?
0.5;Come to think of it, they were\Nboth here that day one year...
0.5;Between taking Kohei to the hospital and\Nthe police arriving, it was total chaos.
0.5;It's been one hour and twenty-eight\Nminutes since we found the body.
0.5;Fruit juice dissolves the\Nrubber used in balloons.
0.5;but before the incident, someone\Ncut my cheek in the storehouse!
0.5;...and the light from Kogoro-no-ojisan's\Ncigarette to cut them in the dark.
0.5;Which means normally you\Ndon't wear fake nails.
0.5;Yeah. I wanted to see if I\Nactually could walk on water,
0.5;Because her hatred was driven\Nby her mother's chapped hands.
0.5;who was found face-up in the\Nconcrete next to Nakatsu-san.
0.5;murdered Nakatsu-san\Nwhile floating in midair,
0.5;Then head to his place immediately\Nand ask him what's going on!
0.5;You have to be careful\Nwhen talking to Mori-san.
0.5;You can't blame me for\Nwanting Mori-san's help.
0.5;He said it's the police's\Nfault the UFO got away,
0.5;and that maybe they're deliberately\Nblocking him so information about aliens
0.5;everyone had been avoiding\Nthe park out of fear.
0.5;Could we come inside to\Ntalk to you for a minute?
0.5;Our karate clubs had a joint\Npractice session today.
0.5;Even if you hold the opening\Nshut, you can still breathe.
0.5;As expected, the construction\Ncrew found you
0.5;He said that even though he's\Nthe editor of a UFO magazine!
0.5;But how did you know he\Nwas hiding them there?
0.5;Oh, you mean the envelope containing\Nthe marriage registration.
0.5;We could head back, but\Nthe sun's about to set.
0.5;With brilliant detective\Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;Did anyone else enter the\Ncave during that time?
0.5;it would've been easier to\Nleave the scaffolding up.
0.5;Why did he do it the day\Nafter it was taken down?
0.5;They appear on the back when the victim\Nis lying face up on the ground.
0.5;You'll find pieces of the\Nvictim's jacket there.
0.5;The killer must've climbed\Nthe cliff to escape.
0.5;and bring the hammer of\Nrighteousness down on him.
0.5;That's all right. I'll know the\Ntruth once I process this data.
0.5;The Night Baron is an elusive\Nvillain created by my father, Yusaku!
0.5;This makes no sense.\NI'm going to our room.
0.5;There's only eight here,\Nus three and these five.
0.5;But it's just a simple\Ngame to stay for free.
0.5;When I was a kid. I was\Nbest friends with her brother.
0.5;You know who the\NNight Baron is by now, right?
0.5;Well, guess I should\Nget back to my room.
0.5;The perfect computer virus,\N'Night Baron.'
0.5;Next up are the results\Nfrom races nine through 12.
0.5;"""The Tokyo-Style Detective\NShow Next Door, Part One!"""
0.5;Apparently they go together\Nsurprisingly well.
0.5;I was watching the races\Nin my office around then.
0.5;Then could you tell him\Nwe'll be waiting for him
0.5;In that case, I'd like\Nsome more grated radish.
0.5;But why did the thief leave the\Nstolen pouch in the bathroom?
0.5;All that's left is for me to name\Nthem and for them to confess.
0.5;who were scattered throughout\Nthe department store,
0.5;With brilliant detective\Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;near the stairs for the\Nculprit to come down.
0.5;It looked like they were removing something\Nstuck to the bottom of their left shoe.
0.5;How did you know they were\Nmiddle or high school students?
0.5;next to a phone booth\Nnear the department store.
0.5;and has a brooch resembling\Nthe number 6 on her chest.
0.5;The large Miyadai Masaru-san\Nwearing a dark gray jacket,
0.5;We'll start at the seventh floor\Nstairs where the sporting goods are.
0.5;Genta, could you describe\Nthe culprit you saw again?
0.5;If you hid both sides of her buttons,\Nit would look like the number 8.
0.5;The basketball uniforms and\NHaibara's clothes are both gray,
0.5;where they were when\NMitsuhiko saw the culprit.
0.5;where you waited for the culprit\Nto come down the stairs, right?
0.5;That means the culprit was an average\Nheight person slightly taller
0.5;Why are you accusing me based on\Nthe vague testimony of those kids?
0.5;We found saliva on the intake\Nof the helium gas can.
0.5;For why you were changing\Nyour voice at a payphone
0.5;The other day, I invited my girlfriend\Nto eat at that restaurant.
0.5;I thought I got all of\Nit off in the bathroom.
0.5;"""A Cottage Surrounded\NBy Zombies, Part One!"""
0.5;But something suddenly jumped out in\Nfront of the car, and they ran it over.

0.5;didn't you go into the forest on\Nthe way here to go to the bathroom?
0.5;Th-This is the magical sword that turns\Nzombies to ash at the slightest touch.
0.5;Which means it's been between\Nthirty to sixty minutes since he died.
0.5;Since we're always getting\Ninvolved in cases together,
0.5;And there weren't any signs that the\Nenvelope had been ripped or wet.
0.5;But our director and club\Npresident suddenly announced...
0.5;We called his name until we were\Nparched, and we were thirsty for beer.
0.5;With brilliant detective\Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;They didn't find a gun when\Nthey searched the area
0.5;and will soon be arrested\Non fraud charges as well.
0.5;She wanted to pick off\Nthe major target first.
0.5;But at the bottom of your\Nheart, you still had doubts.
0.5;Later, Kisaki-sensei agreed\Nto represent Izumi-san.
0.5;With brilliant detective\Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;What's going on? There\Nwasn't any traffic before.
0.5;I had been planning to move\Nsince before the incident.
0.5;She was surprised to see you\Ncome out of Kirisaki-san's room.
0.5;but she had planned to\Nreturn after three months.
0.5;That's not what I meant.\NI mean her appearance.
0.5;Are you sure we should've\Nleft Conan-kun alone?
0.5;so why did she rent the\Napartment under her real name?
0.5;they knew she had written\Nthe suicide note, too.
0.5;why you delayed your plans to\Ncome back here by three months.
0.5;When I visited his apartment that\Nday, he was collapsed on the floor.
0.5;the ambulance couldn't\Nmake it to his apartment.
0.5;First you had to get revenge\Nfor three years earlier.
0.5;to get away with murder was\Nto make it look like a suicide.
0.5;Things sure are peaceful for\Nfather and daughter to argue over this...
0.5;What's so good about it anyway?\NHe's just a third-rate detective.
0.5;Let's check the editing department\Nwhere his manuscripts get sent!
0.5;Are these manuscripts\Nreally written by him?
0.5;Yes. We confirmed it\Nwhen I came here earlier.
0.5;There's nothing\Nto worry about, Kaori-san!
0.5;The same thing happens\Nto lots of other writers!
0.5;He's a struggling\Nwriter who resides in France.

0.5;The bullet in the bulletproof\Nvest was also made by hand.
0.5;If my theory is correct,\Nit solves all the mysteries.
0.5;is evidence that\Nyou switched your guns later!
0.5;Mori-san. When did\Nyou start to suspect me?
0.5;I see. Plugging the gun to be\Nextra safe proved to be my downfall...
0.5;It's a shame you were that\Nwrong about Masked Yaiba all along.
0.5;Oh! Yoko-chan's on\Na music show starting at 7:30!
0.5;Oh, but we're watching\NMasked Yaiba at 7:30.
0.5;They ignored our warnings that\Nwe'd kill them if they resisted.

0.5;Now then, tell us what happened\Nwhen you escaped from the storeroom.
0.5;Why would they do something\Nthis horrible to Ichiro?!
0.5;When he stabbed Mr. Gozo,\Nthat piece of bread fell out of his cuff.

0.5;How do you know that\Nif you dunno where he is?
0.5;Besides, who knows,\Nmaybe Kudo'll show up!
0.5;but there's no telling\Nwhat this guy might say!
0.5;The lips and digits\Nare turning purple,
0.5;In other words,\Nthe killer locked the door and left!
0.5;and the other was in a double\Npocket of the victim's pants...
0.5;The murder took place\Nbetween 3:30 and 4:00.
0.5;It was shortly after\N2:00 when you arrived, yes?
0.5;I went to the next room\Nand watched TV.
0.5;Almost as if pulled\Nstraight out of the bookshelf...
0.5;Got any realizations for me,\Ngreat detective?
0.5;The mysterious bulge\Nin the middle of it!
0.5;The locked room trick,\Nand who did it.
0.5;all the windows were\Nlocked from the inside,
0.5;The killer then took both ends\Noutside the room, beneath the door,
0.5;All that remained was to put the\Nkey down and pull the needle end.
0.5;There's even one in the brooch\NSuzuko-san is wearing.
0.5;to the station wagon and\Nbag the kidnapper prepared.
0.5;Inspector! It's too dangerous for the\Ninvestigators to approach the car!
0.5;What? You want me to buy\Ndiamonds worth 100 million?
0.5;Yes. The kidnapper prepared\Na bicycle beforehand,
0.5;In her desperation to save the hostage,\Nshe's lost her sense of judgment.
0.5;He said I'd find a bottle\Ntied with red ribbon.
0.5;You believed she'd do as you told\Nher if it was for Reina-chan.
0.5;Second, if the wealthy Saeki-san or\Nhis wife had transported the ransom,
0.5;they might have figured out\Nthe diamonds were fake.
0.5;you probably carelessly handled the fake\Ndiamonds and left your fingerprints on them.
0.5;Not even a kid would do\Nthat in this freezing cold.
0.5;However, the police investigation\Nturned up inconsistencies
0.5;When a witness to his alibi named\NIzumi Suda-san was discovered,
0.5;I can't imagine that policeman\Nleaked the information,
0.5;The deduction catches fire\Non the line to the heart.
0.5;The police department just\Nreceived a call from the suspect,
0.5;tell him to come here himself\Ninstead of sending a kid!
0.5;Do you lock the door to the studio\Nwhen you sleep here at night?
0.5;I heard he determined the\Nidentity of the suspect.
0.5;Th-This is the Sleeping\NKogoro I've heard about.
0.5;You don't understand my desire\Nto protect Tendo-san's reputation
0.5;She was sure of the time\Nbecause she checked her clock.
0.5;This will be the inspiration for\Nmy next comic monologue, Mouri-san.
0.5;We'll know the truth once we check\Nthe prints on the art books.
0.5;The fingerprints of the\Nman handing out tissues!
0.5;you were a good person and\Nbecome the center of attention.
0.5;In the next episode,\Nromance turns into mystery!
0.5;Thanks to Ran's plan to\Nbring her parents back together,
0.5;The doctors keep rushing in and out,\Nbut they won't tell me anything.
0.5;As proof, she murmured this\Nafter confirming that he tried to help...
0.5;And then she executed the fake\Ndrowning plan they made in advance.
0.5;Could you get a fresh\Nbeach towel from our room?
0.5;I already told you. She placed\Nthe sea snake in her waist pouch.
0.5;I never had anyone\Nlike him around me before.
0.5;Yet, I asked you for that favor...\NI'm really sorry! I regret it!
0.5;Some glowing gold thing flew\Nover the riverbed really fast.
0.5;Anyway, I'll be back once I\Nget the paperwork together.
0.5;I want to go to the shopping\Narea near the station.
0.5;She'd been in the hospital for a\Nlong time with a difficult disease.
0.5;because I don't think\Nyou're actually a bad man.
0.5;It's natural to think they fell\Nif a person died at a bridge!
0.5;Hattori Heiji and I assisted\Nthe police investigation,
0.5;and uncovered the terrifying truth\Nthe true culprit had plotted.
0.5;The rhythm of my detective\Nskills is perfect!
0.5;It was already nighttime,\Nand they were at a hospital.
0.5;This is Suzuki. He'll be\Nrunning today's event.
0.5;He and his brother Koichi, who's two years his\Nsenior, were raised at an orphanage in Kyoto.
0.5;If I'd known this would happen,\NI would've gone into work instead.
0.5;We don't have time to\Nwait for the bomb squad.
0.5;Sir, you really shouldn't\Ndo this sort of thing...
0.5;Did he walk into the lake,\Nlike the five customers?
0.5;But it wasn't Ekuni-san,\Nrather Iketani-san, a man.
0.5;the summits of mountains, beaches,\Nand even deserted islands.
0.5;There was also an e-mail from that\Npresident guy asking them all to show up.
0.5;"If you take the ""kuchi"" kanji from\NKuchiishi and the ""ani"" from Keigo..."
0.5;And for the record, I am not\Ngoing down with this ship!
0.5;Yeah. I'm don't want to\Nend up like him, either.
0.5;They likely had no idea\Nthey were in the restaurant
0.5;All right, tonight we're having\Nsushi for dinner, sushi!
0.5;In that case, you should look into\Nher connections to Beika City.
0.5;We need to know why she\Nreally came to Beika City.
0.5;Then she would've fabricated\Nan alibi for that time.
0.5;Is there any evidence that\Npoints to the true killer?
0.5;Your theory that she tried to use\Nher ex to fabricate her alibi.
0.5;If you could use a murder\Nfor another purpose,
0.5;When they came to question you,\Nyou confessed to the crime.
0.5;as though he allowed an\Ninnocent woman to fall.
0.5;The reason you made us believe the\Nmurder was committed at eight
0.5;Because you wanted us to believe\Nhe was killed at eight,
0.5;Suspect Hirose Junko-san has\Nbeen arrested once again,
0.5;An impossible and illogical murder\Nin a secluded mountain temple!
0.5;Look, there are some\Non that mountain too!
0.5;This is the would-be famous\Ndetective, Kogoro Mori.
0.5;This place is not meant for\Nuncouth vermin such as yourselves!
0.5;I had you pegged as reporters\Nwho came here about the incident...
0.5;This is Kannen. He has been here the longest\Nand is like an older brother to the others.
0.5;And I'm Tenei--\Nthe head priest of this temple.
0.5;Tonnen and Mokunen,\Nprepare our dinner.
0.5;And the head priest is\Nquite fond of girls in bikinis!
0.5;and uses its tremendous\Nstrength to smash into houses
0.5;Detective.\NI will let you stay the night,
0.5;"as ""Heavenly Dogs,""\Nor Tengu, thus the name."
0.5;If you get scared during the night,\Nyou can come sleep with me!
0.5;And by yet another\Nstrange coincidence,
0.5;You have really keen senses,\Ndon't you, Kannen-san?
0.5;I believe the one who died was\Na priest-in-training named Chunen.
0.5;It happened during\Nthe rainy season...
0.5;I came into this room\Nwith Kannen to fix the wall.
0.5;He said the only\Nthing that could have done it
0.5;I hear he's the\Nsuccessor to a big temple
0.5;Yeah. I was awake\Nuntil a little past 3:00.
0.5;The only things\Nmissing from the scene
0.5;they would have landed\Naround here somewhere!
0.5;Some unused rope\Nand an axe lay on the floor
0.5;that just happened to\Nget a flat tire in the forest!
0.5;And there are cherry blossom\Npetals stuck to the board
0.5;And it wasn't just the drainboard\Nthat had flower petals stuck to it.
0.5;more and more of the wall would\Nerode off, creating a gaping hole!
0.5;A piece of the sliding\Npanel with tape on it.
0.5;was to find out the truth\Nbehind my brother's death
0.5;It's too bad you didn't visit this\Ntemple two years ago, Detective.
0.5;I think we could've easily\Nsubdued her without them.
0.5;I only dabbled in other sports\Nduring PE classes at school.
0.5;Once I get older, I know\NI should pay him back.
0.5;Apparently they're waiting for manuscripts\Nfrom a popular author living in this hotel.
0.5;I'd like to thank you for\Neverything you do for me.
0.5;You said you were just going\Nout to get some cigarettes.
0.5;It said we'd regret it if we\Ndidn't fire his assistant.
0.5;A-Are you saying I was working on a romance\Nnovel while this was happening to her?
0.5;I bought cigarettes from the vending\Nmachines in the elevator hall two floors down.
0.5;Her jaw was beginning to stiffen\Nwhen her body was discovered.
0.5;So was she actually killed\Ntwo or three hours ago?
0.5;Couldn't you have snuck\Nout of the room then?
0.5;"I was stuck on the last scene of ""The Phone,\Nthe Ocean, and I"" which he works on."
0.5;After 5:30, I printed out everything\Nexcept the final pages to give to him,
0.5;When I got here, you were all\Nstanding in front of the room.
0.5;It arrived this morning at\Nmy editorial department.
0.5;"It said, ""If you don't fire the\Nassistant, you'll regret it."""
0.5;He was in his room with his\Neditors watching over him.
0.5;How did I move the body from\Nthis room to the one below?
0.5;Hiding in the shadows was\Nan adults' conspiracy.
0.5;You'll cause a commotion\Nif people know it's you.
0.5;and presents one's audience with the\Nstarting-point and the conclusion,
0.5;Besides, you'll have to\Nwear glasses like Yusaku
0.5;Shin-chan, put this on your\Nchest so we can get out of here.
0.5;I thought it was a morgue like the one\NI saw in that movie the other day.
0.5;Since her clothes are the\Nonly ones missing a badge,
0.5;You called her name loudly\Nand raised her to the top
0.5;in order to convince them\Nto return to their parents.
0.5;Does that mean he's been in\Nlove with you since then?
0.5;You think what happened three\Nyears ago is my fault, don't you?!
0.5;Even heaven is watching the\Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills\Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;In other words, the crime was\Ncommitted during those two hours.
0.5;like a bird spreading\Ntheir wings to decelerate.
0.5;You killed Takemi-san, left Motoki-san's\Ncompass at the crime scene,
0.5;There's a weird smell mixed\Nin with the smell of alcohol.
0.5;You mean perving on someone you're\Nmeeting for the first time?
0.5;I want the deluxe gizzard and\Ngarlic monja with cheese.
0.5;You idiot. Monja aren't\Nsupposed to be so luxurious.
0.5;She said something about being\Nupset and went to the Sumida River.
0.5;Those three women conspired to\Nput a cabbage core in the monja
0.5;In other words, even if a cabbage core\Nwere mixed in with the ingredients,
0.5;Then everyone will be talking\Nabout the Tokyo Barls Collection!
0.5;I'll figure out exactly who it is you're\Nmeeting and get a good look at 'em!
0.5;Are you by yourself?\NIf so, then please sit--
0.5;But if the killer\Nwas covered in blood,
0.5;Which means the only person\Nin the coffee shop then
0.5;You're starting to look\Nmore and more suspicious...
0.5;due to being unable\Nto fit over the stall door.
0.5;Maybe you refastened\Nit in the bathroom?
0.5;"""Just treat girls like objects\Nand they'll be all yours?!"""
0.5;I was just thinking you\Nshould come back to Dad soon...
0.5;This is a clip of when Dad\Nsolved that case at the TV station!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;--are investigating this\Nas a possible murder--
0.5;That's right. He's the guy\NI followed around until yesterday...
0.5;The police don't get\Nmany witnesses like him!
0.5;Then why did you\Nhave Mori-kun trail him?
0.5;that he thought someone\Nwas out to kill him.
0.5;Please find Negishi-san's\Nkiller as quickly as possible.
0.5;The schedule and\Npictures of his Kyushu trip.
0.5;Just you watch!\NI, the great Mori Kogoro-sama,
0.5;he'll say something\Nthat gives me a hint...
0.5;The teeth even\Nmatched his dental records.
0.5;it's far too intentional for the\Nbody to be hidden under the fire
0.5;9:00?! That leaves\Nus only three hours!
0.5;Then you had Detective Mori follow a\Nfake Negishi-san around the following day...
0.5;...to make us think\Nhe was alive until Saturday.
0.5;Your mistake was the substitute\Nyou chose for Negishi-san!
0.5;I, Abe Yutaka, was indeed\NNegishi Masaki's killer.
0.5;and receives floppy disks\Ncontaining a certain program.
0.5;So the goal is to figure out who\Nthe organizer and Night Baron is.
0.5;What?! Ebara-san fell off\Ndressed as the Night Baron?!
0.5;So he fell twenty-one\Nstories onto that statue...
0.5;In other words, the homicidal\NNight Baron is still among us!
0.5;The veranda he\Nfell from is directly above...
0.5;Please stop! I'll give you\Nsome special information!
0.5;That's right. The late\NEbara Tokio was my husband.
0.5;Using that trick,\Nanyone could have killed him!
0.5;Yeah! Anything at all!\NLike, was anything bothering him?
0.5;No, Yasue-san changed\Nthem every three days.
0.5;I guess you can't come,\Nso I'll be going.
0.5;Hey! Don't tell me\NHideomi-san was actually--
0.5;Yeah! And only that\Nperson could've done it!
0.5;OK! We'll begin in\Nten minutes, as scheduled!
0.5;But, he was killed\Nby his accomplice instead.
0.5;Mitsuaki-san planned to strangle\Nthe president with the grappling hook
0.5;to run from Mitsuaki-san's\Nroom to the spare key and back.
0.5;Are you saying she killed Hideomi-san, too?\NAnd what about the will?!
0.5;He dug him up and threw him\Nin there just before the murder...
0.5;When you pushed\NMitsuaki-san off the veranda,
0.5;No more foolish talk\Nabout following Hideomi...
0.5;"On the next Conan...\N""The Bank Robbery Murder Case."""
0.5;Um, in the movie I think they\Ndid this with their fingers...
0.5;If I can offer a detective's\Nperspective, that is.
0.5;I'd like the three of you to wait\Nin the break room in the basement.
0.5;of the train platform with\Na guitar on his back.
0.5;but I ran to the other platform and\Ngot onto the same train as Shu-nii.
0.5;Her information signals\Nthe start of a new case!
0.5;They said no one's been able to get\Nin touch with their agencies, either.
0.5;Yoko-chan's manager said she frequently\Ndoesn't realize her cell phone is off.
0.5;Weren't you listening to Okino Yoko's songs\Na bunch of times because you liked them?
0.5;They asked me again when\NAsuka-san would be arriving.
0.5;What were a couple customers\Ndoing in the storeroom?
0.5;So the owner wasn't in the\Nstoreroom when you searched it?
0.5;While the three of us were discussing\Nwhere the owner could've gone...
0.5;But while Banba-san was serving\Nfood and wine to the customers,
0.5;Forensics is searching\Nthe storeroom right now.
0.5;He previously got in trouble with\Nthe owner for smoking in this room,
0.5;named Kurataya Komakichi saying he\Nwanted to give him a family treasure.
0.5;like historic landmarks from the\Nlate Edo and restoration periods,
0.5;Natsume Asuka. I'm with\Nthe Yamaguchi News Site.
0.5;I was worried you'd get\Ncaught up in the case.
0.5;We missed our chance to discover\Nthe identity of Kurataya Komakichi.
0.5;Inspector Takajo couldn't\Nhave known about that.
0.5;A metalworking researcher\Nnamed Fukuhara Yuichi-san.
0.5;I heard you're going to solve\Nthat case from a year ago.
0.5;Kurataya Komakichi, I hope\Nyou're quaking in your boots!
0.5;Asuka-san's collecting information\Nat Shoin Shrine right now,
0.5;Kido Takayoshi was one of three great\Nnobles of the Meiji Restoration.
0.5;He must be flustered since he heard the great\Ndetective Mori-san is investigating the case.
0.5;We're trying to get to Kido Takayoshi's\Nformer residence, but we're lost.
0.5;Apparently Fukuhara-san believes\Nyou may be Kurataya Komakichi.
0.5;You expressed disapproval\Nof your father's will.
0.5;in the storehouse should be\Ndonated to local institutions.
0.5;After all, if you melted them\Ndown, you could sell them.
0.5;A memorable outfit diminishes your\Nimpression of the actual culprit.
0.5;I thought Asuka-san and Fukuhara-san\Nwere just acquaintances.
0.5;Anyway, I'm glad he was released\Nafter exactly one year.
0.5;Asuka-san probably wanted to find the\Nculprit before his sentence was up.
0.5;by eating some of Yamaguchi's\Nfamous kawarasoba?
0.5;Yuri-san's glass was a\Nskinny champagne glass,
0.5;Or Murakami-san, who spilled\Nred wine on her white cuffs
0.5;and created a reason for\Nher to leave the table.
0.5;and broke his glasses that had\Nfallen beneath the table.
0.5;I'm not sure where to look in\Nthis type of establishment.
0.5;I probably bumped them with my\Nelbow and knocked them off.
0.5;Even if I were, those lenses would be\Non my person or somewhere around me.
0.5;Well, we weren't there when it happened.\NWe can't speak on the matter.
0.5;Like them watching the restaurant\Nor checking their watches.
0.5;and he came to ask her to be his lonely\Nmaster's lover in exchange for money?
0.5;So, when did Morooka-san\Nstart coming to the store?
0.5;To prove it, every race in the world\Nhas red blood flowing through them,
0.5;and your sister said it\Nseemed a little suspect.
0.5;Huh? But I thought he only\Ndid historical dramas...
0.5;No, no, it's completely unfounded!\NIt's a bunch of baloney.
0.5;The front entrance is\Noften swarming with reporters.
0.5;Oh?! Aren't you\NOkita Hajime-san, the actor?!
0.5;Oh, yes! I bought something\NI was hoping you'd teach me about!
0.5;who wears disguises\Nand shoots guns, you see!
0.5;Yeah. That's more reason\Nwhy the reporters stir up trouble here.
0.5;We can probably assume\Nshe was strangled to death
0.5;but Ran, Conan, her husband\NKozaburo-san, and I all saw her.
0.5;We rushed here\Nimmediately, of course.
0.5;Nor do I remember\Nanyone knocking on the door!
0.5;I'd say the same thing about\Nhow you always happen upon murders.
0.5;After all, when this lady fell,\Nher legs were still in the room!
0.5;Yes. This is my first\Ntime in this apartment,
0.5;All the rooms on the 5th floor\Nand above have the same design,
0.5;It's nothing. He just\Nwants to ask some questions.
0.5;He could've set things up\Nso she'd fall over on her own,
0.5;After all, when we brought\Nthe spare key to the room,
0.5;or escape the moment\Nthe door was open!
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;I offer an exhaustive list of crimes from\Nmurder to light offenses in complete versions,
0.5;Hamanaka Misao, you're\Nunder arrest for abetment.
0.5;Hey, Takagi. Are you sure\Nyou needed an adviser?
0.5;The method is to use an odorless\Ngas to blow up an entire building.
0.5;Ishigami Takashi was Wada's superior at\Na company he worked for ten years ago.
0.5;Wada clearly stated that his\Ntarget was Ishigami-san, right?
0.5;Does Hamanaka have something\Nto do with Wada's arrest?
0.5;In order to make a gas\Nheavier than air explode,
0.5;I sure am jealous!\NGoing scuba diving as a couple!
0.5;He said it was the best spot\Nin the area and left before dawn...
0.5;It's a secret spot my\Nfishing friends told me about!
0.5;No, that's impossible time-wise!\NPlus the paper's not dried up!
0.5;Don't let Kasuda-san\Nout of your sight.
0.5;Do you know where that\Nbottle floated in from?
0.5;Now you're here just\Nto catch stuff...
0.5;But the tide will catch up\Nif we don't hurry!
0.5;The water's flowing through\Nto the other exit now!
0.5;it also flows out during low\Ntide via another passageway!
0.5;Stop it, Teruhiko-san!\NIt's me you want to kill!
0.5;A huge victory for the\NJunior Detective League!
0.5;He was then lectured\Nfor a full hour...
0.5;It sounds like all three of them felt\Nquite resentful towards the professor.
0.5;Mori-kun, did anyone approach\Nthe car while you were here?
0.5;There weren't any other\Nwet spots on the seat.
0.5;But without any evidence, this\Nwill be treated as an accident.
0.5;It's probably safe to assume\Nthere was no foul play.
0.5;We couldn't have killed the professor,\Nwho was sleeping in the car.
0.5;to automatically fall from his seat\Neven if no one else was present
0.5;The culprit packed said dry ice inside\Nthe air cushion and hid it on the seat.
0.5;you simply needed to pass the\Nstuck phone through the gap.
0.5;The body of Sergeant Momosaki\Nwas discovered in the park.
0.5;Were the victim Sergeant Momosaki\Nand Lieutenant Yagi close?
0.5;Since they tried to flee before\Nthey were issued tickets,
0.5;You'll follow the established rules\Nand accept the judgment of the law.
0.5;The victim is Lieutenant Yagi Shiori\Nof the MPD Transportation Department.
0.5;as well as all other officers,\Nshould be on their guard.
0.5;It's as if she forced herself to face right\Nwhile scraping her face against the ground.
0.5;I'm not surprised no one's talking\Nabout some traffic violations.
0.5;There was a commotion at that\Nintersection over there.
0.5;Two female officers got into a\Nshouting match with some drivers.
0.5;Not only that, but he's a\Npretty shrewd private eye.
0.5;You two are both in the\NTransportation Department, too.
0.5;They're calling the three traffic\Nviolators they arrested a week ago,
0.5;Contact me immediately if you notice\Nanything after seeing the photo.
0.5;This is the alleyway off Third\NStreet in Haido City, right?
0.5;You kept calling every ten\Nminutes, so I blocked you.
0.5;Of course! I got another\Nyakuman daisangen last night!
0.5;How many times have I said to wear\Ngloves when handling exhibits?!
0.5;he said he was going\Nto turn it into a hotel!
0.5;That's strange. There's supposed\Nto be another room up ahead.
0.5;There's no point in trying to talk\Nyour way out of this, Kubota-san!
0.5;Inspector Megure says he wants you\Nto help with something else.
0.5;It's a trick the killer used\Nto put the blame on Kubota-san!
0.5;This is a trick that doesn't work\Nwithout nulling Kubota-san's alibi.
0.5;It looks like someone scribbled over\Nthe letters with a pen that didn't work!
0.5;But then why did he take\Nthe card in the first place?!
0.5;That pen had been placed there\Nin advance by the killer,
0.5;Everything that happened afterward\Nis exactly as you said, Detective.
0.5;And then there was Kubota-kun,\Nwho went and sold some of my exhibits.
0.5;It's always Conan\Nand that old man Kogoro!
0.5;about the biology room skeleton\Ncoming to life at midnight?
0.5;Just what sort of alibi does\Nhe have in that camera?!
0.5;when my grandmother allegedly ran off\Nwith the ring that was discovered.
0.5;Mizusawa, the man who found the\Nbody, is one of my drinking buddies.
0.5;This industry has a habit\Nof abbreviating everything.
0.5;Long strokes meant she'd\Nmanaged to calm down.
0.5;It was. It needed to arrive in time\Nfor its close-up during the climax.
0.5;Something happened between the\Ntwo of them that traumatized her.
0.5;"Sumire-san, do you know what\N""I Killed Them"" was about?"
0.5;You were the only saving grace of\Nthat incredibly unpleasant program.
0.5;But I heard from Sonoko-san that\Nyou often go to his house to clean.
0.5;You must be the great\Ndetective Mori Kogoro-san.
0.5;Yes, so I invited a detective to find\Nthe scoundrel trying to kill me
0.5;If I brought a bunch of\Nstern-looking men in here,
0.5;Who gropes a bunny girl in\Nfront of his own daughter?
0.5;I'm not sure where to look in\Nthis type of establishment.
0.5;He's been employed by my recently\Ndeceased wife's family for a long time.
0.5;I'll stop by to see the girls while\Ngetting a new suit made there.
0.5;She hurried off to the\Nchanging room a moment ago.
0.5;There's not much cash in\Nit, but my house key...
0.5;to figure out where she's been\Nsecretly meeting Morooka-san.
0.5;It could only have been\Npoisoned by Morooka-san,
0.5;on the table when she was\Nstartled by the phone alarm.
0.5;It's a ten minute walk from the\Nstation to the crime scene,
0.5;I'm going to hit up his\Nentertainer friends next,
0.5;So DoDonPa-san had a grudge\Nagainst Tendo-san over that?
0.5;I was invited to be a regular\Non a famous variety program,
0.5;With everything lining up like this,\Nthere isn't any room for doubt, is there?
0.5;The weapon.\NApparently it's not the metal bat.
0.5;The only people coming\Nand going this morning
0.5;Oh, right. Around 9:00, I\Nwas at Suda-sensei's studio.
0.5;DoDonPa-san, Tendo-san wasn't\Nkilled after 11:00 like you said,
0.5;She's an artist who lives in\NAkebono City in my neighborhood.
0.5;Looks like you didn't get\Nyour chance to shine, Mister.
0.5;he had borrowed to help\Nhim come up with ideas.
0.5;Does that mean you know\Nwho the real murderer is
0.5;the most obvious suspect is the\Nperson Tendo-san was extorting.
0.5;after saying the previous\Nnight he would stop by at 9:00.
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut the world is even more so!
0.5;It appears it was\Nlocked from the inside.
0.5;There've been many wasp-related\Nincidents so far this year.
0.5;It's possible it was a murder\Nplotted by one of these people!
0.5;The rain cap that should\Nbe on this chimney is gone.
0.5;I was with all of you!\NHow could I have killed her?!
0.5;you tied fishing line to it,\Nled it to the downstairs kitchen
0.5;And so the balloon\Nwent flying out of the chimney.
0.5;Making me the caretaker because\NI saved her life was nice and all,
0.5;Way to go, Dad! You solved the case!\NYou're a genius, as always!
0.5;That's why the culprit was able\Nto poison Yuri-san's glass.
0.5;Some of the girls saw your butler\Nover there trying to pay off Yuri.
0.5;He passed by Yuri-san while heading to\Nhis car parked outside the restaurant
0.5;When we talked to the bodyguards\Nby his car earlier,
0.5;and went to the changing room\Nto change her stained cuffs,
0.5;Which leaves the man sitting by\NYuri-san's glass the whole time.
0.5;It could only have been you,\NFukamachi Atsufumi-san the butler.
0.5;It's likely he used two separate\Nphones to sound the alarm
0.5;I bought a second one and\Npracticed countless times...
0.5;Yuri-san has regained consciousness,\Nand her condition is improving steadily.
0.5;ln the desk was a file filled\Nwith newspaper clippings
0.5;...and the L, N, and R that\Nwere engraved on their foreheads...
0.5;What is the key to answering\Nall these mysteries?
0.5;Don't be stupid! There were\Ntwo big lions on the front door!
0.5;"And the cuckoo clock\Nrang at 1:10. Another ""110."""
0.5;So if we check all the zebras\Nin the house, we'll find something!
0.5;"This ""1100"" is a code referring\Nto the king of all the beasts: the lion!"
0.5;It goes inside the mansion\Nthrough a hole in the wall!
0.5;And I don't think either of them are\Nthe Misao-san who sent the letter.
0.5;I assume it was the real Misao-san,\Nwho's locked in the attic now?
0.5;Monjiro-san probably made\Nthe watch for you out of stolen jewels.
0.5;But stolen goods are\Nstolen goods. I can't accept it.
0.5;That's it. The rich flavor of\Nthe ham comes from olive oil.
0.5;and selling them to take home\Nat your bakery is a great idea.
0.5;Wouldn't it be lame\Nfor the great Mori Kogoro
0.5;If it had been a murder,\Nthere would've been a fight
0.5;Yet, she doesn't have\Na single scratch on her.
0.5;Very well, Miss. I, the great Mori Kogoro,\Nwill reveal his true colors
0.5;By car, it'd take ten minutes\Nfrom that bar to the beach, one-way.
0.5;First, Tanaka-san called\Nher to a separate location
0.5;And you must've felt\Nquite confident about this trick...
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Takatori's goals are most\Nlikely acquiring his share,
0.5;For less than half a share,\Nhe agreed to kill me.
0.5;and the buyer Yamaga who\Nleaked the information.
0.5;Why would I steal jewels\Nfrom my own jewelry store?
0.5;by saying he could join you\Nand Utsumi in Hong Kong.
0.5;It's true that Manda-san was trying to\Nprevent Inuyama-san from becoming independent.
0.5;This single drama made Yashiro-san\Nthink she owed Manda-san everything,
0.5;They used the concern that was submitted\Nby coincidence in their plan.
0.5;What does the famous Mori\NKogoro-san want with me?
0.5;since they found out the victim\Nwas Manda-san's wife, right?
0.5;I heard you asked my detectives\Nto bring Manda here.
0.5;When they heard that, the culprit\Ncame up with their plan.
0.5;to the residents of Manda\NTowako-san's apartment building,
0.5;They said half a month ago\Nyou were asking around
0.5;about Manda Towako-san's upstairs\Nneighbor Kijima Kumi-san.
0.5;but if it's chosen, the\Nstation calls the listener.
0.5;You incited Kijima Kumi-san to\Nfight with Manda Towako-san.
0.5;because you were desperate\Nto frame Manda-san.
0.5;I never stood a chance\Nagainst the great detective.
0.5;It's my first break in a while,\Nso I'd rather drink and sleep here.
0.5;I hear the hotel's beach is\Nfilled with sexy women in swimsuits...
0.5;This hotel definitely\Nlives up to its reputation.
0.5;Huh? We don't need separate rooms.\NWouldn't a suite be cheaper?
0.5;I'll start with these two first!\NI met them on the beach just now!
0.5;Besides, he seems to be a celebrity,\Nso you can't blame them.
0.5;but if you ever distrust your wife,\Njust call the Mori Detective Agency.
0.5;Now, now. You can argue\Nall you want after you're married.
0.5;I saw the sea snake!\NIt was about forty centimeters long!
0.5;Of course, the person\Nwho sucks out the poison
0.5;In the twenty-two years since\Nthis hotel was founded,
0.5;not a single visitor\Nhas been bitten by one.
0.5;In any event, one of those four\Npeople was responsible for this!
0.5;Next episode is part two.\NWho's the culprit?
0.5;Say, didn't Shuko win the\Ndistrict championship last year?
0.5;The current headmaster\Nfounded it way back when
0.5;Hey, you! This is\Nauthorized personnel only!
0.5;But they still have to\Ndrop out of the tournament.
0.5;That's right!\NHe went to the nurse's office!
0.5;I was scared to\Nbe in the tournament.
0.5;Apparently, they need to\Nconsult the ailing headmaster.
0.5;That's why he pitched\Npoorly and was relieved.
0.5;Had the 180 cm\NKaji-kun or Eto-kun cut it,
0.5;"After all, ""The Nameless Gonbei""\Nis a term for an unknown man."
0.5;The cop said Gonta seems to\Nbe suffering from amnesia.
0.5;But Detective Takagi didn't\Nmention anything like that.
0.5;He broke into the house with the intention of\Nrobbing it and knocked Koda-san unconscious.
0.5;While he was nursing the ankle he twisted\Nwhile running, you ran into him.
0.5;Next episode features high\Nschool girls in swimsuits.
0.5;Maybe there will be some really\Nbig case, like in a drama.
0.5;once we finish this job, they\Nsaid we'd be paid out generously.
0.5;I saw two men transporting coolers that\Nlooked just like the ones in that car.
0.5;Then if we figure out\Nwhat these signals mean,
0.5;That's exactly what a certain someone\Ninfluenced by his Gallicized mother does.
0.5;When the man they were\Nsignaling walked past me,
0.5;And this only happened\Nbecause I got kidnapped?
0.5;That's because Mizunuma Kaho-san\Njumped from the bridge at 5:15 AM,
0.5;Come to think of it, Kaho-san was carrying\Na handbag in the security camera footage.
0.5;Isn't the park where this\Nhappened near Kaho-san's house?
0.5;I never thought I'd be\Nable to use it like this.
0.5;If you have such good vision,\Nwhy did you purchase—
0.5;The great Mori Kogoro has never\Naccepted a job and failed!
0.5;The two of you can enjoy\Nthe road to hell together.
0.5;It's possible they want\Nus to notice something.
0.5;I have a feeling the culprit is\Ndesperately asking you to do that.
0.5;I just happened to be hired.\NThere's no way for me to know.
0.5;He told me to ask you\Nabout Nagakura Ryoji-san,
0.5;You nurtured your love at beautiful\NHadoson Seaside Park,
0.5;You really are the country's\Ngreatest detective!
0.5;I protected a young woman and\Nmade her turn over a new leaf!
0.5;That man was probably shocked\Nto hear the charges.
0.5;and the man who came to get the\Nransom money were probably just hired.
0.5;Normally, when a person falls in a river,\Neveryone looks that way out of surprise.
0.5;Why not learn from the\Nexperience for next time?
0.5;Then wouldn't they take\Nit into the mountains?
0.5;I found signs of a struggle\Nand those objects.
0.5;That's when Fukami-san dropped her brooch\Nand left without realizing she'd lost it.
0.5;I was thinking of buying a house, so\NI had her tell me my lucky direction.
0.5;But when I trusted her and\Nmarried him, he swindled me.
0.5;It's hard to imagine them telling someone\Nabout it on purpose, which means...
0.5;The secretary wouldn't have told\Nanyone they hated the victim.
0.5;It'd be better for you to\Nbe involved from the start?
0.5;One of these three is\Nsimultaneously weak-willed
0.5;You also left the text document\Nthat would be discovered
0.5;while the police searched for a\Ntrue culprit who didn't exist.
0.5;Now I'm the killer just\Nbecause of my character?
0.5;Easily flattered, drunkard,\Nand irresponsible...
0.5;You'll find out for yourself\Nwhen you get to the end!
0.5;First, you need to make\Nyour way to London Bridge!
0.5;They're definitely looking\Nfor the same treasure as us!
0.5;Darn it. I was hoping\Nwe could dry our clothes off...
0.5;Yeah, this'll show\Nus which way is which!
0.5;It's the Big Dipper,\Nmade out of logs and stones!
0.5;And it's also located off\Nof Cassiopeia's central star,
0.5;a pop-up doll,\Nand broken ceramic!
0.5;we shut ourselves in the lodge\Nto prevent any further casualties,
0.5;He faked his death\Nduring the first incident,
0.5;See how it's unnaturally\Nplaced at the narrow end?
0.5;In other words,\Nsometime before dinner,
0.5;She did say that Ayako-san was\Nloitering in the hall in the afternoon...
0.5;The person behind all three\Nincidents at this lodge... was you!
0.5;and the brakes would have\Nkept the car motionless
0.5;even if the engine\Nwas running and in drive.
0.5;Before dinner last night,\Nthe killer opened the garage
0.5;What if the outside\Ntemperature increases?
0.5;If he had been\Nkilled shortly afterward...
0.5;water drops would have\Nfallen by the front tires.
0.5;so we couldn't check\Nthe state of rigor mortis!
0.5;That was probably because his\Nfoot slipped off the brake pedal
0.5;from people\Nwho got near the car!
0.5;...they would\Nhave an airtight alibi!
0.5;Your theory almost sounds\Nlike it's straight out of a novel.
0.5;And as I've said before,\Nwhen the fire erupted in the garage,
0.5;Ayako-san used a\Nlighter to look for the book!
0.5;Ayako-san declared\Nshe knew who the killer was.
0.5;Hearing that,\NTogano-san grew flustered
0.5;Togano-san was\Nthe only one alone with her...
0.5;and then attacked\NFujisawa-san with an ice pick!
0.5;Ayako-san saw a certain\Nsomething in your room
0.5;A case like this is\Nlike a walk in the park for me!
0.5;What are you\Ntalking about? I'm just a kid!
0.5;I saw you using it\Nin the corner of my eye!
0.5;but from your tone and the\Nway you set up your theories
0.5;and now you're living\Nwith your girlfriend
0.5;He said you're so annoying\Nhe can't stand you!
0.5;But since he's part of the\NNagano Prefectural Police,
0.5;I can't imagine taking\Nthe same pictures as her.
0.5;Two women reveal their true selves\Nto try to bring each other down.
0.5;Come to think of it, she\Nmentioned something
0.5;I was asked to come wake\Nher at five in the evening,
0.5;she was struck repeatedly on the\Nhead with a thin rod-shaped weapon.
0.5;But is it true that the key card was here in\Na hotel without automatically locking rooms?
0.5;Kyona-san said she wouldn't\Nopen the door for anyone else,
0.5;She was almost attacked by a stalker\Npretending to be one of the staff.
0.5;Since then, she stopped inviting\Neven acquaintances into her room,
0.5;The drama's set in this hotel,\Nso she's staying here, too.
0.5;In any case, we're going to\Ninvestigate the room more closely.
0.5;As though you knew today's filming\Nwould be canceled anyway.
0.5;The murder victim seemed\Nmalicious, rude, and vulgar,
0.5;The culprit locked the room without\Nusing it for its intended purpose.
0.5;he likely died between one hour\Nto one and a half hours ago.
0.5;it's likely that his remaining three\Ntargets are members of the police force.
0.5;and the man who holed up\Ninside a bank six months ago.
0.5;We let Section Chief Kuroda\Nknow about it, too.
0.5;Yes. I believe she runs\Nthe salon on the corner.
0.5;That's what they said about you\Nat the station, Edogawa Conan-kun.
0.5;It's possible that Akiyama\Ndid some quick thinking.
0.5;But Inspector Yamato\Nwould never kill someone!
0.5;We should prioritize\Njustice over emotions right now.
0.5;Morofushi's will be a bit tight\Nwith the spare tire in the back.
0.5;Well, he was hanging from a rope\Nmade from two connected loops.
0.5;Inspector Morofushi and Akiyama-kun\Nwere crouching near the body.
0.5;I can't say for sure yet, but I\Nthink I know who his next victim is.
0.5;Saegusa Morinao is only one letter\Noff from Inspector Saegusa Mamoru.
0.5;It may have something to do with\Nthe bank case six months ago.
0.5;The suspect was actually\Nabout to surrender himself
0.5;"""They'll know where we got the\Ngun and find out about X."""
0.5;There's no question\Nabout it, Inspector.
0.5;Search all you want!\NI'm going upstairs to sleep!
0.5;Even if you did catch that\Ngang of Italian thieves,
0.5;And doesn't he ever get\Ntired sleeping like that?!
0.5;You guys go wait by\Nthe phone booth outside!
0.5;Conan-kun would never\Ndo something like that!
0.5;The corpse I'm referring to is the man\Nwho was sitting in this very room,
0.5;to make it sound like your brother\Nwas yelling from upstairs.
0.5;As proof of this fact, you picked up\Nthe phone, which didn't ring,
0.5;You're one smart kid,\NI'll give you that.
0.5;By my worthless brother, who stayed\Nin my house and refused to work!
0.5;The brother I idolized so much\Nhad become a common leech!
0.5;I'll use these Power Kick Shoes\Nto finish this!
0.5;than a mischievous cat who liked\Nto sneak into all kinds of places.
0.5;It's their fault for being greedy\Nand handing over their money.
0.5;The rhythm of my detective\Nskills is perfect!
0.5;When I returned after buying the\Nitems the president requested,
0.5;This is Kitamura Mitsuru-san, the\Nproprietor of Kitamura Hardware,
0.5;I had all my son's tuition\Nmoney taken from me!
0.5;but on the towel discovered\Nin the president's office...
0.5;There it is, Mori-san! Has your\Ndeduction so far been incorrect?
0.5;Yes. In the main office was a small\Ntank in addition to the large one.
0.5;they would have used it to\Nkill the president as well.
0.5;The true culprit was soaked\Nby the water in the fish tank.
0.5;Nozomi-san, that is the definitive evidence\Nthat proves you're the true culprit!
0.5;Though I'm the one\Nwho solved the case, not him...
0.5;What's the matter?\NYou don't need to get so mad...
0.5;while others took the\NYu-no-Yama Line like us.
0.5;Maybe we should transfer\Nto the Hana-no-Machi Line here?
0.5;Passengers transferring\Nto the Tokyo-bound train
0.5;He broke his fingers\Ntrying to remove it!
0.5;He suddenly got angry\Nwhen I insisted he take it...
0.5;If he had transferred\Nto the Hana-no-Machi Line...
0.5;An overpass connects\NPlatforms 3 and 4.
0.5;No! It's the killer\NI want you to find!
0.5;Yes. The real person\Nresponsible for this incident
0.5;to delay the Hana-no-Machi\Ntrain's departure,
0.5;"Mori-san's right; there was\Nboth a phone call and a search."
0.5;I found it hard to believe he\Nwould hand over all the negatives!
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;No matter how you look at it, you're\Nclearly not my dad or brother.
0.5;We'd know how much they've figured\Nout and what they're looking for,
0.5;We'd know how much they've figured\Nout and what they're looking for,
0.5;Where are we going when he\Nknows I'd slow him down?
0.5;You ate the canned salmon the\Nother day while you were drinking.
0.5;He wouldn't give me any\Nwhen I asked for a bite.
0.5;It does take longer when you're\Ndealing with foreigners.
0.5;We're being treated to dinner\Njust for bringing a can opener.
0.5;I can't sit in the hospital\Nwhile the rest of you work.
0.5;Conan-kun has gone missing\Nsomewhere around 4-chome.
0.5;They're going back to the rehearsal space\Nwith Inspector Megure and the police.
0.5;He came after Ebizo-san\Nand Conan-kun visited me.
0.5;stealing the mask does not\Napply to this situation.
0.5;I'm sorry. He caught me entering\Nthe building at night.
0.5;Iwami-san isn't holding\Na case or anything else.
0.5;The most direct path from your house to the\Ntheater is a straight and mostly flat road.
0.5;so you wrapped tape around the hose you\Nmanipulated in your garage beforehand—
0.5;to take special care of the real mask\Nuntil the day of the performance.
0.5;Hosoo-san, Conan only said that the\Nculprit covered him with something.
0.5;This is a shot of you picking\Nup Iwami-san's note.
0.5;I didn't get to see the place\Nbecause of what happened last time.
0.5;First I'll invite my dad to this\Naquarium where he'll meet my mom
0.5;Maybe they shouldn't meet\Nin front of the sharks.
0.5;There's a business card\Nstuck between the pages.
0.5;Ran, go to the entrance\Nand get an employee.
0.5;He carefully withdrew the blade from under\Nhis jacket so blood wouldn't spill everywhere.
0.5;Today he canceled his shift\Nbecause he had something to do.
0.5;A woman around 160 centimeters tall\Nin a miniskirt who likes dolphins.
0.5;"They told me his name, so I asked, ""I'd like\Nto return it. Do you know where he is now?"""
0.5;Since it's likely she wore high heels to her\Ndate, subtract five to eight centimeters.
0.5;Why did they ignore the\Nvictim's calls and emails?
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Kudo\NShinichi Aquarium Case, Part 2!"""
0.5;was found dead inside a\Ncompletely-sealed bathroom!
0.5;Is it... Is it true\Nthat Mina killed herself?!
0.5;So I looked through her\Naddress book and called him here.
0.5;Besides, you should\Nknow more than anyone here
0.5;If you claim Masayo-san killed her,\Nthen would you mind telling us
0.5;Just because your\Nanswering machine is on
0.5;...it was Masayo-san whose\Nhand was on the knob.
0.5;to buy the necessary tape\Nand two bathroom detergents.
0.5;After all, it's possible the room\Nreally was sealed shut with tape.
0.5;She was late for our date,\Nso I thought she might be sulking inside.
0.5;So this key holder I showed off\Nto you wound up being my downfall.
0.5;That was the condition she gave\Nwhen she accepted my proposal.
0.5;I was going to open it in front\Nof him the next time we met
0.5;Besides, I don't want him to\Nthink I changed my attitude
0.5;then the building manager might\Nbe keeping them somewhere else.
0.5;Oh, you mean an envelope containing\Na marriage registration.
0.5;Hey, wait. It's not on the\Ndesk or in any of the drawers.
0.5;But it seems like what's written\Non that paper is some kind of code,
0.5;Hey, some of them look like numbers\Nif you cover part of them.
0.5;Now that that's settled,\Nlet's solve this code together.
0.5;I'll win all seven crowns and\Nwait for Yumi-tan's response.
0.5;I don't know which number\Nto start with either.
0.5;So we should look for\Nthe second sheet, right?
0.5;he was panicking because he\Ncouldn't find an important fan,
0.5;It expresses the importance of\Nlooking at what's on the inside,
0.5;he always ate cheese because it\Nwouldn't make his hands dirty.
0.5;Shibuya-sensei is a teacher\Nat Haido Elementary School.
0.5;We can go, but I'm not sure\Nwe'll be able to get inside.
0.5;the school's been strict\Nabout who they let in,
0.5;There's a police car parked\Nin front of the rear gate.
0.5;It described at great length how\Nobesity can lead to hyperglycemia,
0.5;he got back out, changed his shoes,\Nand reentered the concrete.
0.5;And all the footsteps are\Npointing the same way,
0.5;Then the guy who was with\Nthe victim must've done it.
0.5;I was just wondering what color\Nthe cigar-shaped UFO you saw was.
0.5;And this is the world's greatest\Ndirector, Kujirai-chan.
0.5;Finally, there's Nichiuri TV's\Nposter-boy presenter, Nino-chan.
0.5;When I came home from work yesterday,\NI found a note in my mailbox...
0.5;You'll pay for this! Don't\Nthink you'll get way with it!
0.5;Then you did invite the victim\Nout later that night...
0.5;But you received a CD recording of\Nthe show in your mailbox, right?
0.5;heard the show on the radio\Nand recorded it onto a CD.
0.5;Isn't this case a little\Ntoo convenient for someone?
0.5;But your wife was firmly\Nagainst divorce, wasn't she?
0.5;are you sure you didn't go to the apartment\Nand put the CD in Kijima-san's mailbox?
0.5;If he caused the murder, then Manda-san\Nwill be held responsible, too.
0.5;But I suddenly felt tired, so\NI went home and went to bed.
0.5;Why don't you tell us all about it at the\Nstation where there won't be any outsiders?
0.5;I thought the suspect in this\Ncase was already arrested.
0.5;Just before we were going\Nto start prosecuting him,
0.5;Maihama claims he was in his\Napartment in Sasago-cho,
0.5;At this rate, I'm going to be framed\Nfor murder, so I'll tell you the truth.
0.5;So it was impossible for\NMaihama to murder Reigan.
0.5;So we spent all day yesterday\Ntrying to solve the problem.
0.5;If he didn't want his face to be seen,\Nhe only needed to wear a mask.
0.5;After getting the money's location\Nout of her, he knocked her out again.
0.5;and made it seem as though\Nhe was there the whole time.
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;The man who ordered\Nthe murder has been arrested!
0.5;basically, I can't contact\Nhim while he's out to kill me!
0.5;I see. So that's why you\Ncame to the great Mori Kogoro.
0.5;You mean like a trek\Nup a mountain ridge?
0.5;The next day, we set out on a traverse\Nup the Tanbara Mountain ridge.
0.5;You read it too, didn't you,\NConan-kun?
0.5;It was about a killer with amnesia,\Nif I'm not mistaken.
0.5;In short, there's a good chance one\Nof the other five people is the Fox!
0.5;Plus he was way ahead before,\Nbut now he's with us...
0.5;Hold it! We're all going\Nto wait at the mountain lodge!
0.5;Anyway, the killer\Ncould be in this very room.
0.5;Who knows?\NMaybe it was you, Ushio-san.
0.5;What do you want?\NWe're in the mountains.
0.5;What do you think's\Nwrong with Takanashi-san?
0.5;You're Mori Kogoro-san,\Nthe great detective, aren't you?!
0.5;Yes! The peerless hitman, the Fox,\Nthe one behind these incidents...
0.5;Suspicion initially fell\Non the manager Red Shirt,
0.5;What kind of idiot would\Nhurt themselves like that?
0.5;He's being made to dance even\Nthough he's the head chef.
0.5;The sister passed away from\Nsubarachnoid hemorrhaging, right?
0.5;in front of our customers as\Npart of our business strategy.
0.5;Of course Red Shirt and\NUranari had feelings for her.
0.5;In order to frame Red Shirt\Nfor Uranari-san's murder.
0.5;Both the night before last\Nwhen Uranari-san was killed
0.5;Wakasa-sensei accidentally\Nruined the tiger screen.
0.5;But you only came here\Nbecause I ruined the screen.
0.5;When I go shopping after school,\Nmost things are sold out.
0.5;it's because the woman we\Nsaw banged on the door, too.
0.5;You'd be curious what color it\Nwas or how much of it was on you.
0.5;So your fingers wouldn't smudge\Nthe words you'd written.
0.5;It's obvious enough that it's\Nnot Kurumi's handwriting.
0.5;In any case, the important thing\Nis this Polaroid the killer took!
0.5;similarly colored shirt and wrap it\Naround her left hand under your head.
0.5;on a clear plastic file\Nusing permanent marker.
0.5;so we would believe the\Nsuspicious woman did all this.
0.5;I doubt your international tour\Nwould've gone well anyway.
0.5;When digging for clams, it's best to\Narrive an hour or two before low tide,
0.5;I'll set my bow tie-shaped voice-changer\Nto loudspeaker mode, and...
0.5;Mister, you picked up a soccer\Nplayer strap on the train, right?
0.5;In this case, we might actually be more\Neffective than your average police officer.
0.5;Has anyone seen a tall\Nman wearing a flat cap?!
0.5;As long as you guys keep\Nshouting, eventually...
0.5;If we'd known, we would've\Nhelped you look for it.
0.5;So it should be around here\Nwhere Genta put on his hood.
0.5;There was blood all over the\Ninside of the damaged vehicle.
0.5;Bloodstains less than a millimeter\Nacross from a high speed blood spray...
0.5;Have you gotten used to your\Nelementary school teaching job?
0.5;It wouldn't be strange for a\Nforeigner to drive a foreign car.
0.5;They must've thought they could trick\Nus by pushing her down the stairs.
0.5;But, Sugamoto-sensei, didn't you say\Nyou'd give Shibuya-sensei a ride?
0.5;Its engine is acting up,\Nso I came by train today.
0.5;In any case, will you tell us why you\Nwere meeting with Shibuya-sensei?
0.5;but the lights were out and the gate\Nwas closed, so I didn't see her.
0.5;The investigation would've\Ngone more smoothly.
0.5;That's right. Everyone\Nwent off in different directions.
0.5;Saegusa-san's killer\Nwas also left-handed.
0.5;It would appear you have quite\Nthe observational skills, Nose-san.
0.5;Might another vital tool be your\Nleft-handedness, which you're hiding?
0.5;Yes! The peerless Fox,\Nthe one behind these incidents...
0.5;but couldn't she have\Nbeen stabbed from the front, too?
0.5;She didn't bleed very much,\Nso this must be someone else's!
0.5;If he's gonna lead the way,\Nhe wouldn't use the path we took, huh?
0.5;So he panicked,\Nand had a falling out with her!
0.5;Is our only choice to\Ngo down the mountain now?!
0.5;That's what always\Nseemed out of place!
0.5;What?! That old man\Nisn't the cabin manager?
0.5;But you didn't know\Nthe Fox's face or identity.
0.5;But to my surprise, the old man\Nhe had hostage pushed him and ran!

0.5;We searched the changing room\Nand bathroom next to the pool.
0.5;She was wearing a tank and weights\Non her hips so she wouldn't float.
0.5;But my sister said she\Nwanted to search alone.
0.5;Which means after drowning her around\N1 PM, someone hid the body somewhere.

0.5;Charging full speed ahead\Nwithout slowing the pace.
0.5;Besides, didn't she have graded\Nanswer sheets inside her bag?
0.5;Perhaps she was only\Nhalf-listening to my warning.
0.5;I warned her to be more modest precisely\Nbecause he's still an impressionable child!
0.5;Shibuya-sensei is fluent in English\Nbecause she studied in the United States.
0.5;But everyone around me is\Ntrying to corrupt him...
0.5;I had to take the train\Nto work and a bus here.

0.5;Maybe it was meant for the old lady,\Nand she arrived while she was writing it.
0.5;Forensics has them right now,\Nso all we have are photos.
0.5;Well, in Japan they draw flower\Ncircles for correct answers.
0.5;There's still one thing\Nhe can't possibly know.
0.5;but the top sheet is marked with a\Ncircle and the other with a cross.
0.5;I charge it every night, but I use it a\Nlot, so it's usually dead by evening.
0.5;I'm trying to reveal who did\Nthat to your teacher friend.
0.5;When the culprit struck her,\Nher blood got on the ungraded sheets.
0.5;Compare Shibuya-sensei's flower\Ncircle with the culprit's.
0.5;or Ueno-san, who accepted Camel-san's\Nhandkerchief with her right hand,
0.5;but shouldn't you have understood\Nif you saw the answer sheets?
0.5;we heard him barking and\Nscratching at the wall.
0.5;Then there's a cardboard box and the\Nspray used to remodel the hotel.
0.5;or second time using a\Ncell phone or something...
0.5;I was able to make the\Nsame thing using the spare

0.5;If you're planning to show me another\Nweird monster, give me a break.
0.5;Huh. Looks like you're\Nmaking quite the splash.
0.5;We were eating and chatting\Ntogether just now.
0.5;Forgive me, but what was your\Nrelationship with Kajiki-san?
0.5;Because the railing he\Ngrabbed onto was rotten,
0.5;She used an illusion to make\NKajiki-san trip and fall.
0.5;Believing he was safe, he went to\Npick up his phone without much care.
0.5;It's only natural to assume someone\Nopened them for him and removed one.

0.5;Nope. I haven't been there\Nonce this afternoon.
0.5;could you go up to the second floor\Nwhere Ayaka-san fell, Detective Takagi?

0.5;Yes. Small amounts cause\Nnausea or drooling,

0.5;we found him poisoned to\Ndeath in a locked room.
0.5;Unable to believe the news,\NHaibara and Kogoro-no-occhan

0.5;While the three of us were discussing\Nwhere the owner could've gone...
0.5;But the first time we came,\Nthere was just a blanket.

0.5;More importantly, I want to see\Nwhat's above the balcony window.
0.5;But I don't think the wind would've\Nbeen enough to unstick something.
0.5;Now that forensics is finished,\Nthere's nothing left to see.
0.5;The Sleeping Kogoro can't\Nsolve the case without it.
0.5;between this room and the\Nbedroom by turning on the heat,
0.5;I was just thinking how lucky we are that\NConan-kun knows where we're staying.
0.5;actually refers to a woman who's\Nstrong on the inside like a man?
0.5;I don't care about Rum's\Nseventeen year old mistakes.
0.5;Genta's on the seventh floor where\Nthe sporting goods store is.
0.5;All three of them do have\Na reason for being a hurry.
0.5;They were wearing gray clothes\Nso light they were almost white.
0.5;was a smaller person with the\Nnumber 2 on their clothes,
0.5;Shikama-san lives in the\Napartment next to the victim's.
0.5;when he claimed the victim\Nripped off his food.
0.5;Could the basketball players\Nhave seen the culprit, too?
0.5;But basketball uniforms have\Nnumbers on them, right?
0.5;Because it's confusing, the\NInternational Basketball Federation
0.5;who stabbed someone was\Ncoming down the stairs,
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;I guess you could call it the silver\Nlining, thanks to Inspector Ayanokoji.
0.5;In reality, he was a profligate son who\Nburned through his parents' wealth.
0.5;sponsored independent\Nfilm screening society.
0.5;Sounds like we'll have to\Nre-investigate our case.
0.5;In other words, a bomb was rigged in\Nhis car, just like Yonekura-san's.
0.5;Okuda-san, we heard you once sponsored\Nan independent film screening society.
0.5;They threatened him into building\Nprops and performing odd jobs.
0.5;The outdoor AC unit is working, and\Nthe directional mics picked up sounds.
0.5;The Detective Boys versus\Nthe Silver Detectives!
0.5;It's the Kiddie Detectives versus\Nthe Silver Detectives, huh?
0.5;How did you find a body\Ninside a stranger's house?
0.5;Did you find the hooligan\Nyou were looking for?
0.5;Noticing the victim's\Nblood on his sunglasses,
0.5;An old lady named Kano Tae fell down the\Nstairs at the station and hit her head.
0.5;But he seemed sincerely apologetic,\Nso she didn't report him to the police.
0.5;so you could discover the body\Ntogether and avoid suspicion.
0.5;You had to discover the sunglasses to cast\Nsuspicion on your imaginary hooligan.
0.5;Once they investigated you,\Nthey would find conclusive evidence.
0.5;She should've given me her\Nmoney before she died.
0.5;He had trouble displaying his\Nabilities in demonstrations.
0.5;It's time for me to give up\Nmy black belt and retire.
0.5;It's impossible for a child to\Nclimb that wall without a rope.
0.5;and waited for the others\Nto return from their run.
0.5;who did it when you noticed\Nthe belt was missing.
0.5;Not even this popular weather forecaster\Ncan predict if it's an accident or a case.
0.5;Didn't you hear this sound\Nbefore Yasumi-san's scream?
0.5;I wanted to make a fool out of that\Narrogant woman in front of everyone!
0.5;Yasumi-san did as she was told\Nand triggered the balloon trap.
0.5;But in the next moment, she triggered\Na second trap set by the true culprit.
0.5;When the culprit heard the balloon\Npop, they turned on the machine.
0.5;Because it's drizzling and humid\Ntoday, your shoe polish didn't dry.
0.5;She realized I'd been embezzling\Nthe program's funds.
0.5;She used her remaining strength\Nto leave a dying message
0.5;There's going to be another\Nloud noise shortly.
0.5;"""The crab's only half-boiled, but as a\Nresult, the two swordfish look delicious."""
0.5;"""Since it's light out tonight"" refers\Nto the full moon out tonight."
0.5;I've heard the Toto Tower shuts\Noff half its lights on full moons
0.5;Don't things seem warmer\Nwhen they have animal names?
0.5;I'd like to interview you about the case,\Nso if you could come down to the station...
0.5;Two Nichiuri Sports reporters famous\Nfor their articles on scandals.
0.5;But the place is closed by now.\NI say leave it for tomorrow.
0.5;Please hurry! The security system\Nis going to activate in 10 minutes!
0.5;Genta-kun. That door's going to lock\Nwhen the security system activates!
0.5;We better hurry before\Nthe security system activates!
0.5;For now, let's stay hidden\Nand contact the police! Okay?
0.5;Security office! There's a weird sound\Ncoming from the 7th floor!
0.5;Nothing strange?! Those were\Nsome pretty loud sounds we heard!
0.5;The other guys in the security office\Nknow we're here!
0.5;Damn it! They used a\Nbunch of stupid mannequins!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the\Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;I'm sorry for asking the\Nsame question over and over.
0.5;Yes. I was supposed to today, but\NI had a stomachache this morning.
0.5;And Shimomura-san got caught\Nup in the crossfire.
0.5;Your employees knew Kanzaki-san\Nnormally wears the costume.
0.5;Examine everything including\Nour personal belongings.
0.5;Normally wouldn't you attack\Nin the street at night?
0.5;And most suspicious of all is someone\Nelse happened to wear the costume
0.5;Yeah. The first time they\Ncalled my cell phone.
0.5;But if he simply killed him, the killer's\Nmotive would have led us to him.
0.5;Then this is none of my business.\NYou don't need me here.
0.5;Make sure you study all this\Ngreat detective's secrets.
0.5;If there's anything you\Nneed, don't hesitate to ask.
0.5;Why don't you use your voice changer\Nto give the lecture yourself?
0.5;We're waiting on the autopsy\Nfor the cause of death,
0.5;This was in the left breast\Npocket of the victim's jacket.
0.5;The blade of the weapon\Nmatched the damaged section.
0.5;There were no signs that\Nit had been tampered with.
0.5;I was able to confirm everyone's\Nalibi for 2:50, with one exception.
0.5;Your motive was the rage you\Nfelt towards Inokoshi-san
0.5;Earlier I took Reizei-san\Nto his changing room.
0.5;He got involved in two\Ncases before he knew it.
0.5;And, after investigation,\Nthe possibility of an outside killer vanished!
0.5;But could you really stab with this?\NThere's nowhere to grip it.
0.5;Plus, the mark on her back seemed\Nsmaller than those skewers' tips.
0.5;Okay, everyone. Please place\Nall your belongings on the table.
0.5;Yuko-san. After Kazue-san arrived,\Ndid you leave the classroom?
0.5;Quit joking around!\NI'm sensitive to light due to my age!
0.5;It would seem the murder\Nweapon wasn't a skewer.
0.5;Under one millimeter?!\NThen that means...
0.5;Kaoru-san!\NHow'd you get that black eye?!
0.5;but my mother-in-law dotes\Nover her son Tatsuhiko, my husband.
0.5;He even hit me last night\Nbecause I talked bad about her.
0.5;He left for Hawaii on a\Nbusiness trip this morning.
0.5;Y-You still aren't cleared of suspicion!\NYou can see out of that eye!
0.5;So you had to give up your dream\Nof having your own restaurant.
0.5;Here's the blouse\Nyou asked me to mend.
0.5;It would be easy with that,\Nand not immediately obvious!
0.5;So that's why that\Nperson made that mistake...
0.5;No blood was detected\Non anything in the sewing set.
0.5;when setting up the ice\Ntrick in the electrical room.
0.5;That's right. Have a look at\NNishitani-san's right index finger.
0.5;Yes. He put a thread\Nthrough the needle, and...
0.5;Is something wrong with\Nwearing sunglass-like contacts?
0.5;Was it because she was cutting\Noff your financial support?
0.5;Nishitani-san. Your actions\Nweren't based on love.
0.5;for some reason Ejiri Kyoko-san\Nwas killed by having her neck cut.
0.5;He must have turned into a\Nzombie and killed Kyoko-san!
0.5;Harawaki-san said he didn't\Nwant to just become a zombie.
0.5;You just set it on top of the\Nenvelope and look through the hole.
0.5;So when you block out just enough,\Nyou can see through the paper.
0.5;The culprit used the break to poison\NHarawaki-san, look inside the envelope,
0.5;He was hiding inside the\Nwardrobe using this setup.
0.5;played the eight year old video\Non Harawaki-san's tablet,
0.5;You placed the phone in the\Nhand of Harawaki-san's body
0.5;but Kyoko-san realized\Nthe trick you had used.
0.5;it might actually solve the mystery\Nbehind Harawaki-kun's suicide.
0.5;It was strange that it took so\Nlong for you to hear a scream.
0.5;from the wardrobe and\Npretended to be surprised.
0.5;Heiji-niichan said they had\Nsomething important to discuss.
0.5;I know you brought him a special drink,\Nbut he can't drink it right now.
0.5;You wouldn't want anyone to suspect\NHide of doping, would you?
0.5;Doesn't the stadium keep\Nan official sports drink?
0.5;The players haven't arrived yet,\Nbut all their equipment is here.
0.5;I see. The players don't have\Nto carry anything themselves.
0.5;While you were checking the\Ndrinks in the locker room,
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is\N""Friendship Washed Away In The Riverbed!"""
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 986\N""The Two Faces (Part Two)"""
0.5;to find her missing husband Muto Issei,\Nthe president of a trading company.
0.5;He was the president of\Nthis second-hand shop.
0.5;He said he needed to do something\Nfor work and left around 1 AM.
0.5;When you think of it that way, it is odd\Nthat they didn't change his clothes.
0.5;He was probably a thief who repeatedly\Nused this second-hand shop as a cover.
0.5;He summoned Nonaka-san here and\Nknocked him out with a stun gun.
0.5;It's just my deduction based on\Nthe evidence and circumstances.
0.5;Masako-san, I promise that\Nman will pay for what he did.
0.5;I'm not looking for missing\Npersons for a while.
0.5;My mind is still that of\Na great detective, though!
0.5;"that spell out the word ""Tenkaichi""\Non three separate mountains."
0.5;Congratulations.\NYour alibi is airtight.
0.5;My name is Yamada, from the monthly\Nmagazine Literature Era.
0.5;"Yes, it published his\N""Heroic Sword Legend"" series."
0.5;That's right!\NHis deadline was tomorrow!
0.5;and nothing would ever\Nbe as good as his!
0.5;No, seeing as you used\Nto work with him,
0.5;You just never give up!\NKeep harassing me and I'll sue!
0.5;I kept quiet so you could\Nhave all of the credit,
0.5;where you ran into Ran and had\Nher continue taking more pictures.
0.5;made it easy to mistake\Nit for a picture you took today!
0.5;would be published as\Na series in Literature Era.
0.5;Kyogoku-san accidentally knocked\Nout a stuntman filming a TV drama.
0.5;Speaking of medicine, Ran-kun,\NI have a question for you.
0.5;Do you think Conan-kun and\NShinichi are the same person?
0.5;It's possible that they\Nwaited for Tokuzono-san
0.5;The cut required four stitches,\Nand I lost a lot of blood.
0.5;This banana strawberry shake and peach\Nmelon shake are Odori-san and Jinmei-san's.
0.5;Which means your staff could have\Ngotten their hands on a poison?
0.5;Either way, we can assume they\Nacquired the poison beforehand.
0.5;The sound that toy just made is the\Nsame as the sound I heard then.
0.5;Was he killed because he figured\Nout the culprit's identity?
0.5;You're sure you want to\Nwait for a confession?
0.5;I thought you'd say that, so I also picked\Nup unsolved cases from the year before.
0.5;Why didn't the bomb in Yonekura-san's\Ncar have a detonator or timer?
0.5;How did the culprit know Suemura-san\Nwould go to that warehouse?
0.5;Of the three bomb plots,\Nonly the third succeeded.
0.5;That coincidence was the\Nfirst question I had.
0.5;In other words, the culprit wanted\NOnda-san to die in the red car
0.5;The bomb was placed inside a box and\Nset to explode if it was opened.
0.5;Yonekura-san probably intended\Nto go rig the explosive as a bomb
0.5;on his way to the airport\Nfor his business trip,
0.5;Yonekura-san kept muttering Onda's name\Nwhile staring at the screen of his phone.
0.5;We should contact the\NHyogo police immediately.
0.5;We've learned that what we thought was a team\Nof four robbers was actually a team of five.
0.5;To thank you for the last twenty years,\Nwe've prepared a number of special plans.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the\Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;I tell him every day not to bother\Nother people, but this brat never—
0.5;But the car crashed after the\Nkid jumped into the street.
0.5;"It's ""Nanatsu Men""\Nof the Kabuki Juhachiban."
0.5;The mask maker Gagoze Akaemon—that's\NEbizo-sama's role—
0.5;Akaemon appears while\Nwearing the Buaku mask.
0.5;The expression changes based\Non your viewing angle.
0.5;I-Indeed! I don't know what to do\Nwith all the admiration I receive.
0.5;we all work on the script\Nand performance together.
0.5;Did they want to sell it\Nor keep it for themselves?
0.5;It has to be someone who knows\Nthe value of the two-faced mask.
0.5;but if only Minowa-san and the receptionist\Nhave keys to the lock beyond that...
0.5;This morning it was on\Nthe floor of that room.
0.5;but are you sure you're not actually solving\Ncases while hiding behind Mori-san?
0.5;My car's brakes were destroyed,\Nand I was nearly killed.
0.5;High school student Shinichi was\Nforced to take a drug that shrunk him!
0.5;If the organization learned that\NShinichi and Conan are the same person
0.5;Your heart might\Nact up again if you don't.
0.5;And it's all thanks to the software\Nyou gave me a year ago!
0.5;I have to thank you in some way.\NWhat would you like, little boy?
0.5;Oh, Inspector Megure!\NGood morning!
0.5;Yeah, and then\Nhe called just to be safe.
0.5;Sometimes the police\Ninvestigate unnatural deaths too.
0.5;How did you do that?\NThat was amazing!
0.5;The air conditioning is\Nprogrammed to always keep the place
0.5;and when he came home,\Nhe was so drunk he couldn't walk.
0.5;I'm asking just to be sure,\Nbut where were you then?
0.5;I need to inform\Nthe company directors!
0.5;Tokito! Why the hell\Nweren't you paying attention?!
0.5;but then a certain\Nman got in the way...
0.5;It's possible for a home computer\Nconnected to a phone line
0.5;when they entered a coffee\Nshop with the AC on too high.
0.5;Good morning!\NSorry for the early intrusion!
0.5;But Tokito-san!\NThere's cat litter here!
0.5;You did it because you knew\Nsomething was going to happen
0.5;Yet you used\None to kill somebody!
0.5;He didn't even bother for me\Nto accept him as a client or not!
0.5;That's not possible!\NHe's been dead for over 10 years!
0.5;almost as if he was\Npossessed by something.
0.5;I bet someone on the island wants\Nyou to look into Keiji Aso's affairs!
0.5;Tonight they're holding a 3rd-year\Nmemorial for Kameyama-san,
0.5;Don't let the mayor\Ncontinue his reign of terror!
0.5;It's the curse!\NIt's the curse of the piano!
0.5;Hey now, don't be getting\Nahead of yourself.
0.5;Say, just how long has\Nthis piano been here?
0.5;he stopped going out, almost as if\Nhe were afraid of something.
0.5;He's just a baby chick\Ncompared to me, though!
0.5;It's almost like I work\Nas a part-time doctor here!
0.5;If you're looking for the sheet music,\NConan-kun gave it to me.
0.5;You and that old man\Nwere the only ones asleep.
0.5;Sorry, but I went to\Nthe restroom around 6:30.
0.5;This code's easy if\Nyou know how to read it.
0.5;There's some more sheet music\Nat Nishimoto-san's feet!
0.5;My guess is that they did something,\Nusing this code.
0.5;What was Murasawa-san\Ndoing here this late anyway?
0.5;The suspicious person\Nwho ran out of this room
0.5;The letter's author was Keiji Aso,\Na pianist who murdered his family,
0.5;The reason the killer dragged\NKawashima-san into the piano room
0.5;What's the big idea, rushing here\Nto the broadcast room like that?!
0.5;The reason Hirata-san always\Nclaimed the piano was cursed
0.5;because Murasawa-san saw him taking\Nback the drugs he had left there!
0.5;If he was the murderer, he wouldn't\Nhave killed anyone in the piano room.
0.5;At room temperature, it takes 15\Nto 30 minutes for human blood to dry.
0.5;There's a button lit\Nnear Kuroiwa-san's neck.
0.5;But if I remember correctly,\Nthe one who approached the body was--
0.5;in order to send the coroners\Nback to the mainland,
0.5;Doing this, you altered\NKuroiwa-san's time of death,
0.5;This is all written in the sheet music\Nthat survived that fire...
0.5;But I was sweating bullets\Nwhen they started questioning people.
0.5;Hold on, Ayumi-chan!\NWe're coming to save you!
0.5;Are you sure you didn't get\Nexcited when you saw Ran naked?
0.5;If I had helped Hakuya\Ninstead of going shopping,
0.5;But there weren't any tomatoes\Nfloating in the bathwater then.
0.5;In other words, after sinking\Nthe body in the bath,
0.5;the culprit covered the water's\Nsurface with tomatoes to hide it.
0.5;Besides, Tamami could never\Ndo something like that.
0.5;That red demon who\Ncommitted that murder
0.5;The Red Woman doesn't know\Nabout Sumika's cleaning habits,
0.5;Family members attested\Nthe Red Woman's mother
0.5;They're not like the pranks\Nyou just mentioned,
0.5;We can neutralize her with my\Njeet kune do or Ran-kun's karate.
0.5;Oh, is that why you invited me\Nhere so early in the morning?
0.5;I wasn't sure how it would turn out\Nsince you've been skipping rehearsal,
0.5;You're going to be playing\NIkkyu-san in your upcoming play?
0.5;The water for washing the\Nbrushes is pitch black.
0.5;Yes. I'll take the children\Nhome once we're finished.
0.5;This Polaroid that was on the\Nfloor next to me proves it.
0.5;She must've entered without realizing\Nthat strange woman was inside.
0.5;and take selfies to make it look\Nlike they have girlfriends.
0.5;Do you remember what the\Nwoman who knocked you out
0.5;I think he said he wasn't taking her\Nwith him on his international tour.
0.5;He said he'd cook for her so they\Ncould talk about it tonight.
0.5;We didn't smell any food when\Nwe entered the apartment.
0.5;It smells like the cosmetics\Nsection of a department store.
0.5;There really was a woman wearing a\Nbroad-brimmed hat and sunglasses.
0.5;Could you cancel my spot\Nat tonight's French dinner?
0.5;Saizu-san's possession that\Nthey covered in poison.
0.5;As soon as you enter a warm\Nplace like a ramen shop,
0.5;we spotted a suspicious\Nfigure outside a house.
0.5;Later we stopped the three\Nof them in the shop.
0.5;from picking up something she\Nforgot from her workplace,
0.5;It escalated into a fight,\Nand she was murdered.
0.5;Apparently, she tripped\Nwhile chasing the culprit.
0.5;what else could they have been doing\Nwith the hose next to the body?
0.5;they would've brought\Nsomething to make the noise.
0.5;They concluded that Miike and\NI had let the culprit escape,
0.5;If I were the culprit,\NI'd be too scared to come.
0.5;And I think Mizushina-san probably knew\Nwhen Tonda-san went to work, too.
0.5;Someone had gone through\Nthe dresser drawer
0.5;One time she came here really drunk\Nand loudly bragged about them.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is\N""Ramen to Die For: 2, Part Two!"""
0.5;Ran and I came to the Toto\NGymnasium to cheer on Hattori,
0.5;And since he won't fight in the finals\Neven if he wins his semi-final match,
0.5;But the month's almost over,\Nand you've hardly taken any.
0.5;Did you hear any strange\Nnoises inside the bathroom?
0.5;That was probably the sound of them throwing\Nthe armor out the bathroom window.
0.5;maybe he thought they were a student in\Nthe tournament and let his guard down?
0.5;There's blood on the thigh armor,\Nbut none on the gauntlets.
0.5;Could you have them cancel the tournament\Nand bring the tournament organizer here?
0.5;It seems like the killer\Nwore the skirt backwards.
0.5;Since that woman headed to\Nthe same bathroom as him,
0.5;If you sharpen a single piece of\Nbamboo and swing it horizontally,
0.5;was you dulling the pointed\Ntip against the wall.
0.5;Their opponents made a comeback,\Nand my son's team was eliminated.
0.5;He showed favoritism since\Nthey're both from Kansai!
0.5;While putting it back, he said he thanked\Ngod while holding it with tears in his eyes.
0.5;Say, would you like\Nto see Gomera close up?
0.5;Over-expensive\Nsets and special effects.
0.5;They're all the ones\Nthat Gomera beat!
0.5;He couldn't have killed\Nhim with that leg...
0.5;When the incident occurred,\Nwhy where you here?
0.5;So was the entire staff\Nreally in the screening room?
0.5;That's not enough time to\Ndon the suit, kill someone,
0.5;And then through that\Ndoor to the roof...
0.5;Forget Gomera, he can't\Neven play a person...
0.5;Oh, come on! Let me\Nhave some glory too!
0.5;What?! I ran into the killer in the hall,\Nand even saw them escape!
0.5;Adachi-san was only gone for\Nfour or five minutes. Not enough time.
0.5;returned to the storeroom,\Nand stabbed himself with another knife
0.5;The killer ran off at full\Nspeed with the suit still on.
0.5;But weren't you the one who\Nwanted to quit Gomera the most?!
0.5;That's something that\NProducer Kamei made up.
0.5;After all, he's been my partner\Nfor these past ten years.
0.5;we found three sets of\Nfingerprints on the gun.
0.5;But the larger ones have climbed\Nover 10 thousand meters in the air.
0.5;But until the coroner examines\Nher, we can't be sure.
0.5;You should probably get your\Ninjuries looked at, too.
0.5;Mizuguchi-san opened the deflation\Nport and reduced his altitude.

0.5;Have the entire department begin\Nsearching for the bomb immediately.

0.5;It doesn't make sense for a\Nproof to be misaligned, right?
0.5;So this is your sister's\Nmeager little celebration!
0.5;Shouldn't we go, Dad? It'll be\Nreally crowded if we don't go soon!

0.5;But Mori-kun.\NThese are both chlorine-based.
0.5;I also believe she was in a very\Nconfused state before killing herself!

0.5;This photo was taken in the living room\Nwhere the murder took place, right?
0.5;Though we're not yet sure if\Nhe stayed at the crime scene
0.5;He always displayed it in the front\Nsince it was valuable to him.
0.5;I don't know. I was panicked,\Nso I don't know where I put it.
0.5;But I still don't know\Nthe most important part.

0.5;I'm only here to observe you tonight.\NI don't plan to steal anything.

0.5;It's a floating prison! Even if he\Ndoes get on, he's like a rat in a trap!

0.5;They are my letter of challenge\Nto any foolish thieves.
0.5;Now, then.\NPlease put them on your chests
0.5;Eh?! Kaitou #1412 disguised\Nhimself as Daddy to get on the ship?!
0.5;And except for the real one,\Nthey're all imitations!
0.5;It's teeming with rich kids\Nand company presidents.
0.5;He possesses an immeasurable\Nevil talent that he uses

0.5;So if the message\Nwas on that card...
0.5;They hid it in their palm and\Npretended to pull it from the deck!
0.5;This is Chopper #1!\NHe hasn't fled outside!
0.5;Don't let a familiar face fool you!\NHe's a master of disguise!
0.5;You then stole the real Black\NStar during the confusion
0.5;I didn't know which one was\Nreal, and I didn't have any hints!
0.5;"The Black Star was\Npurchased sixty years ago;"
0.5;"You even made\Nsure to write ""the real one."""

0.5;Dear me! He's just being sulky,\Nafter being left alone all this time...
0.5;I appreciate everything!\NI'll give you my thanks another day!
0.5;Isn't that right,\NKudo Shinichi-kun, their son?
0.5;Stay still, and I'll take you to\Na nice place... A more fun place...
0.5;As soon as the deal is done,\Nwe're supposed to get rid of him.
0.5;Guess my only choice is\Nto hide in that fridge...
0.5;Oh! That wine must\Nbe dripping somewhere...
0.5;They must've cut out\Nletters to make a message
0.5;Guessing the missing letters\Ngives I, Te, Ho, Be, Ru, and Ka.
0.5;Which means the August day\Nabove September 27th is... 30!
0.5;So this is where\Nthey're making the deal!
0.5;That masked man will kill me\Nfor sure if he catches me again!
0.5;OK, Masao. The door locks by itself,\Nso you just need to close it!
0.5;But the fact you couldn't tell means\NI still have the skills as an actress!
0.5;And you successfully followed\Nall of our clues to make it this far!
0.5;Of course! Well, you just\Nbarely passed as a detective,
0.5;Yonehara Sakurako-san asked a\Nhotel bellboy to unlock the door.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the\Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Shouldn't you go home\Nand eat a proper dinner?
0.5;Saya-san recorded a video of\NSakurako-san with her phone
0.5;I didn't have time to\Nrecord a video like that!
0.5;Sakurako-san, when Saya-san\Nasked you to come to her room,
0.5;stuck to Saya-san's door\Njust below the peep hole.
0.5;she was able to take a video of\NSakurako-san ringing the doorbell.
0.5;the string is wound around the rotor shaft,\Nand the key card slides under the door.
0.5;Yeah. That's why Saya-san dropped her hat\Nthe moment she entered Kyona-san's room.
0.5;Most of the pictures on Kyona-san's blog are\Nselfies, but Saya-san's has none at all.
0.5;"But blinded by bias, all you could\Nsee were the words ""hit and run."""

0.5;The victim Kadowaki Eiji-san didn't have a\Nvery good reputation in the neighborhood.
0.5;He was also questioning the neighbors\Nabout the Kadowaki family.
0.5;he might do something\Nthat couldn't be undone.
0.5;Takase-san, did you know that\NKadowaki Yasuko-san's younger son
0.5;But if I wanted revenge, wouldn't I\Ngo after Kadowaki-sensei directly?
0.5;I see. The police have put\Na lot of thought into this.
0.5;He wasn't surprised at all that\Nthe police suddenly showed up.
0.5;The six of you will\Nhave to share cars with--
0.5;All the air conditioners\Nwere set to go on at 12:30!
0.5;You're the only one\Nwho could've done it!
0.5;Why won't you\Ntake us to your reunion?!
0.5;What do you mean why?\NIt's my reunion...
0.5;Actually, I was going to treat you\Nto a fancy meal instead of taking you!
0.5;Why do I have to take\Nthat little brat to the reunion?
0.5;but he didn't know the difference\Nbetween a real gun and a model.
0.5;You sure he's not overexcited\Nfrom seeing you naked?
0.5;Don't be silly! I dumped\Nthis clod a long time ago!
0.5;I'll introduce her\Nto you guys sometime!
0.5;As a gym instructor, I can't\Nafford to lose to the lot of you!
0.5;Yeah, only once,\Nwhen I was a junior in college.
0.5;Nobody but me and Mori are to\Ncome in here, since we're detectives!
0.5;Who would've thought we\Nwould be giving Yumi an autopsy...
0.5;Seven hours ago...\NWhich means around 3:00 PM?
0.5;Then there's no question\Nit was a suicide...
0.5;they stick the barrel\Nagainst their head, right?
0.5;You must take the great\NMori Kogoro for a cheap joke!
0.5;I want you to watch what\Nthey do and what they try to do.
0.5;"""Both daughters have\Nterrible personalities."""
0.5;What'll you do with the money\Nyou make from selling the company?!
0.5;How odd. He almost\Nnever went into the basement...
0.5;Was this to record\Nthe person who killed him?!
0.5;This smell... Ichikawa-san\Ndidn't drink the wine after all!
0.5;That's it! Only that\Nperson could've done it!
0.5;I've finally figured out\Nthe truth behind this incident,
0.5;when he learned Kazue-san\Nwas planning to kill him.
0.5;Yes. The killer openly gave him\Nthe poison while everyone watched.
0.5;but you decided to use\Nit as a chance to murder him.
0.5;but I barely beat the Meijin\Nin yesterday's final game.
0.5;Taiko Meijin, Haneda Shukichi's\NMeijin title match.
0.5;Yeah. Once he regains the Meijin title\Ntoday, he'll have a Septuple Crown.
0.5;Then the seven Yumi-san\Nmentioned before...
0.5;A TV star who was using a photo of the well\Nas her screen saver suddenly became popular,
0.5;But doesn't Taiko refer\Nto Toyotomi Hideyoshi?
0.5;The seven refers to the\Nseven major shogi titles.
0.5;An unspoken rule forbids him from\Nusing a cell phone during a match.
0.5;There's no waiting in shogi,\Nbut I've always made her wait.
0.5;so she called us from a pay phone\Nwith the change in her pocket.
0.5;You should get a patrol car\Nready for when she does.
0.5;It's in the middle of a slope\Nwith a terrifying name.
0.5;It was their fault it nearly\Nturned into a murder.
0.5;I heard they garnered a lot of\Ncriticism, and magazine sales fell.
0.5;He was a reporter for\NNichiuri Sports magazine.
0.5;I'm sure my coworkers have\Nalready told you that.
0.5;Later he checked the video\Nso he'd have an alibi.
0.5;You either accidentally took or\Nstole the victim's flash drive,
0.5;Unbelievably enough, they\Ncoincidentally created the same plan
0.5;Kuwana-san was working late\Nin the office by herself.
0.5;Allow me to explain the\Ntruth behind the case.
0.5;Sitting in the driver's seat caused the hem\Nof his pants to ride up, exposing his socks.
0.5;Kagazume-san meant to\Nmurder Hashizume-san
0.5;they destroyed the will and\Nnever spoke of it again.
0.5;I'm worried she was kidnapped\Nor got caught up in something.
0.5;Does that mean you didn't hear\Nany suspicious sounds either?
0.5;Besides, if that kind of sound were made in\Na residential neighborhood like this one,
0.5;We found something,\NDetective Takagi. A woman's body.
0.5;That man over there is the victim's\Nhusband Higuchi Masaki-san.
0.5;But over the course of making inquiries,\NI became certain you did it.
0.5;"After all, she was screaming ""let me\Nlive tonight"" and ""kill me tomorrow."""
0.5;In other words, you climbed\Nover that rose bush.
0.5;I was wondering if Detective\NMori-san would be on News City!
0.5;you can use numbers that look\Nand sound like letters to write things!
0.5;It was her home. But it\Nwas her answering machine.
0.5;Then couldn't she\Njust call them herself?
0.5;Should I bring an\Numbrella and come get you?
0.5;"Now, the reason Aki-san\Nsent this ""2003"" message first"
0.5;"I bet 0109 means, ""I want\Nto eat a huge eel box lunch!"""
0.5;This number came in after\Na message to call the police.
0.5;News City was my idea!\NIt was my show from the start!
0.5;That means you're\Nsnow pellets, Genta-kun!
0.5;Yes. Lately she's been\Ngoing out at night a lot.
0.5;Hey, you're saying that after\NI backed up your alibi?
0.5;Anyway, does he really have\Ndissociative identity disorder?
0.5;Based on their position, he grabbed the trophy\Nthat was sitting here, raised it over his head,
0.5;and brought it down on the\Nback of the victim's head,
0.5;They were set up in the living\Nroom of Tengan-san's apartment.
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “The\NVentriloquist's Illusion, Part Two!”

0.5;...who was murdered in America\Nseventeen years ago?
0.5;but if it's well-received, it'll\Nbe switched to prime time?
0.5;That kid living in the room next\Ndoor may have been killed already.
0.5;More importantly, solve this\Ncase as soon as possible.
0.5;If the police search this room,\Nthey'll find out about me.
0.5;...concerning Haneda Koji's\Nmurder and come here.
0.5;Sorry. It took a while\Nto explain the situation.
0.5;Right now at this moment,\Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;More importantly, I saw a\Nbunch of people out front.
0.5;she said she found a letter\Nfrom her dead grandma
0.5;In any case, let's look for the\Nother arrow at the entrance.
0.5;Don't you think this arrow's\Nshape is a little off?
0.5;So if you follow the instructions\Nand open the vanity
0.5;I thought you said you\Ntold them to keep quiet!
0.5;I don't want to be stinky when\Nwe're staying here overnight.
0.5;to transport the sheet of ice\Nand a shovel to move the snow.
0.5;Besides, the culprit wouldn't\Nhave called out to us.
0.5;is what I'd like to say,\Nbut unfortunately, Ryoko-san,
0.5;You are simply protecting\Nthe true culprit, Juri-san.
0.5;Because of that, I had a\Nhard time finding a job.
0.5;Normally my dad wouldn't be\Nat home during the evening.
0.5;Her partner's family says they can't get\Nmarried while the culprit is still unknown.
0.5;Ten days may have passed, but it's\Nalways worth examining the crime scene.
0.5;Yes, the full amount he\Nowed. 280 thousand yen.
0.5;Mori-san, do you really\Nbelieve he's a murderer?
0.5;If there's a true culprit who cleverly\Nbeat the police investigation,
0.5;This will finally stop the gears of tragedy\Nthat have been turning for our family.
0.5;Mori-san, despite your stature, I can't tell\Nyou the details of a patient's condition.
0.5;“The Woman Standing in\Nthe Window, Part Two!”
0.5;Ma'am, you were at the\Nintersection yesterday, right?
0.5;It would've been natural for\Nher to report it to the police.
0.5;You two question the\Npeople she was extorting.
0.5;Saki-san was pushed at an\Nintersection yesterday.
0.5;Let's withhold judgment until we talk\Nto Konno Michiyo the office worker.
0.5;Maybe she thought he was someone else\Nsince he looked different from usual.
0.5;I'd been traveling since\Nthe day before yesterday,
0.5;It even explains how they got\NSaki-san to come to the crime scene.
0.5;The woman in room 202 lost\Nher key about a week ago.
0.5;but there are some things us\NDetective Boys can't figure out.
0.5;You impersonated Saki-san and called\NNumagaki-san on the phone so he wouldn't have an alibi.
0.5;But that connects you to\Nthe deceased Saki-san.
0.5;Sorry, but could you be\Nmy girlfriend for a bit?
0.5;Still, I can't believe Conan-kun's\Nthe only boy on the beach
0.5;Obviously! This is\Nyour villa's private beach!
0.5;You bought that swimsuit to\Nshow Shinichi-kun, didn't you?
0.5;but my father should be\Nat the villa by now.
0.5;Tatsuji, the middle son,\Njoined the company
0.5;So you witnessed Mr. Tomizawa\Nbeing murdered by his son Yuzo
0.5;11:34 pm... The time\Nthe murder took place.
0.5;These folks saw the killer's\Nface just after the murder!
0.5;It's true. Telephones receive\Npower through the phone lines.
0.5;It was all so I could\Nkeep writing my novels...
0.5;I guess fact is\Nstranger than fiction...
0.5;She's probably relieved\NYuzo-san wasn't the killer!
0.5;The waves are\Ntoo high for us to swim out!
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nwhat could Shinichi be doing?
0.5;They don't sell these\Ntoys in stores anymore...
0.5;In other words, they've either\Nbeen sending used toys
0.5;So this letter is the only\Nclue as to who the sender is...
0.5;Say, do you think the sender\Ncould be trying to buy something
0.5;Morning glories?\NWith the weather as cold as it is?
0.5;I'm not allowed to show\Nthe records to other people...
0.5;Say, would you like to see\Nthe painting for yourself?
0.5;or people who were released\Nor checked in on that day.
0.5;I think it might be the parents\Nof Tomoya Ogino-kun here!
0.5;It was already too late for him when\Nthey brought him in to the hospital...
0.5;After all, I am a father\Nbefore I'm a doctor.
0.5;No. I saw on TV that even in\NEurope, there are exceptions.
0.5;after cutting your food with a knife,\Nyou switch your fork to your right hand.
0.5;Unlike Kichi-niichan,\Nhe doesn't smile at all.
0.5;In that case, I'll use what\Nmy PE teacher taught me.
0.5;I thought you were from England,\Nthe land of fish and chips.
0.5;Wouldn't that make everyone who\Nlikes to travel part of the circus?
0.5;It broke his cervical vertebrae,\Nkilling him instantly.
0.5;Some people only know\Nothers by a nickname.
0.5;The other day I nearly\Nlost a fortune in stocks.
0.5;The deduction catches fire\Non the line to the heart.
0.5;Because we didn't find the container\Nfor the poison in this room,
0.5;Beppu-san and Happo-san, the\Nculprit must be one of you two,
0.5;She was able to poison the cup\Nand dispose of the container.
0.5;Juri was drinking tea from\Nthat cup the whole time.
0.5;When you add lemons,\Nit changes from blue to pink.
0.5;The hibiscus tea is a purplish\Nred which looks very similar
0.5;Then she nudged the poisoned\Ncup with her own again,
0.5;I let you fall under suspicion so\NI could get away with my crime.
0.5;I chose butterfly tea for\Nits detoxifying effects.
0.5;Come to think of it,\NI waited for her here then.

0.5;and we were going to bring in\NMisaki-san in for a line up.
0.5;When I came in, I noticed the\Ndoor was really heavy and thick,
0.5;While he was covering\Nhis hands with his eyes,
0.5;Anyway, where's that so-called\Ndetective of yours?
0.5;Don't tell me it's that Shinichi boy\Nyou were looking for earlier?
0.5;He belongs to a relative\Nof Professor Agasa!
0.5;It occurred when she went to play\Noutside after returning from school.
0.5;No. Other than Asao-san's shouts\Nfor help, it was completely quiet.
0.5;or there's no telling what'll\Nhappen to your daughter.
0.5;I followed you and then I saw\NJumbo jump out from here!
0.5;Kidnapping case? Detective\NKogoro Mori is your man!
0.5;Even if my daughter\Ndid ask for your help,
0.5;you will make arrangements for a\N1-week trip that starts tomorrow!
0.5;Who are you to talk?\NI was the one who found him...
0.5;The deduction catches fire\Non the line to the heart.
0.5;He was probably confused and mistook\NAyumi-chan for his own child.
0.5;Ayumi-chan, when that man grabbed\Nyou, did you notice anything?
0.5;Also, the button Conan-kun found here\Nis the same as the ones on his clothes.
0.5;Apparently it's because the desolate\Nslope is flanked by temples.
0.5;In other words, the seven and\Nthree refer to lances or spears.
0.5;Since he called himself the Headless Shogi\NPlayer, he must be connected to shogi.
0.5;This move will fork his\Nking and silver general.
0.5;What's curious is the rook and\Nbishop pierced by the nail,
0.5;Two and a half more\Nhours until the time limit.
0.5;Because the bishop was on that square, it\Nmust have been captured and placed there.
0.5;Even in the worst case scenario, we had\Nto know what that forward rook meant.
0.5;I warned you not to tell anyone,\Nbut you brought friends.
0.5;I'd need to get to the Tokiwa\NHotel in Yamanashi by three.
0.5;There was a police car parked\Nin front of the hotel.
0.5;It was quiet after that,\Nso I didn't pay it much mind.
0.5;That's why she told you\Nwhere to find the spare key.
0.5;Are you the girl who collapsed\Nat Makabe-san's house?
0.5;And how could you mistake\Nmy brother and I for lovers?

0.5;You've got Ai-kun's fantastic\Nidea to thank for this.
0.5;I've saved you countless\Ntimes with my quick wits
0.5;I even wore a BIG hat today\Nand cheered for them.
0.5;Since I was told I hadn't stewed\Nmy curry long enough the other day,
0.5;We're going to Chiyari Station to pick\Nup the phone strap our friend dropped.
0.5;Now then, how should we\Nfind this man with his son
0.5;Before his father said\Nthat, did the boy ask him,
0.5;It was after the train screeched\Nto a stop and everyone fell.
0.5;Maybe he put his cooler inside\Nhis bag since the strap broke.
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;I'm taking in this nice,\Ncloudless sky first...
0.5;that cabin is\Nstill under construction,
0.5;Come to think of it,\NI haven't heard your names yet.
0.5;The whole medical school\Nis praising his essay right now!
0.5;Who asked for ice\Ncream in this weather?
0.5;Oh! This man has a cool watch!\NIt's all sparkly!
0.5;The killer knew Oyama-san\Nwould be watching TV alone then...
0.5;Wait a minute. The blood-smeared\Ntablecloth... Could it be?!
0.5;Not enough time to\Nhave killed Oyama-san.
0.5;Because you bought large amounts\Nof all kinds of snacks in advance.
0.5;It just coincidentally\Nturned out that way!
0.5;No! It must've happened when\Nthe killer and Dr. Oyama struggled!
0.5;My father died of large intestinal\Ncancer when I was very young.
0.5;The reason I became a doctor\Ndevoted to large intestinal cancer
0.5;But society will pay attention if\Na famous professor makes it public!
0.5;by puncturing his lungs,\None of the worst ways to die...
0.5;Yes, this was a murder\Nmade to look like an accident!
0.5;It looks like him, but it's\Na totally different horse.
0.5;Matsumoto-sensei... I haven't\Nseen her since we graduated!
0.5;and whenever someone was bullying me,\Nhe'd always come to my rescue!
0.5;No. One day, he suddenly moved away,\Nand I've never seen him since.
0.5;Oh! You're one of\Nthose Suzuki plutocrats!
0.5;Huh? There's something\Nfloating in the lemon tea.
0.5;We came to see\NMatsumoto-sensei after he did.
0.5;Hold on a little longer! We're not\Nfinished with our investigation!
0.5;Yes! The instant I learned\Nthat she was your daughter,
0.5;You still don't get it, even after\Nseeing all that lemon tea she drinks?!
0.5;And I hear that Toshihiko-san's\Nsentence was reduced...
0.5;We just have to win an award at the\Nkite flying event we're attending.
0.5;She hasn't been matching\Nmany dramas recently,
0.5;We'll run a mobile recording\Napp and leave the screen black.
0.5;She's lying unconscious and in serious\Ncondition in a hospital bed right now.
0.5;Even if we reattach the\Ntail, it still won't fly.
0.5;The tip of the rope on the end\Nwould be worn from exposure.
0.5;Someone untied it, matched the\Nlength, and tied it back on here
0.5;You might watch your feet to make sure you\Ndon't step on your kite's tail, though.
0.5;it would be possible for him to tell\Nthe other man where to stand, right?
0.5;of Okita Hajime,\Nwho lived next door!
0.5;You saw Isami-san collapse\Nonto the veranda next door
0.5;Assuming the veranda we\Nwitnessed Isami-san fall onto
0.5;are from when she was\Nswung onto the veranda?
0.5;but the veranda faces the river,\Nso the chance of being seen was slim,
0.5;plus, even if he\Naccidentally dropped her,
0.5;Yes. From the moment\NI got on the elevator,
0.5;but I was in a hurry\Nand there was no time for that.
0.5;Before you accuse, could we\Nsee this infallible proof of yours?
0.5;from everything we might've\Ntouched in the 6th floor room!
0.5;and when you hurriedly took away\Nthe teacups in the 6th floor room.
0.5;means he made the grave blunder\Nof forgetting to lock the door.
0.5;I didn't have the courage to tell him,\Nso I hid it under the cushion.
0.5;She seemed to be deliberately\Nfabricating an alibi.
0.5;She puts on a virtuous face, but that\Ndoesn't stop that woman from doing it.
0.5;Shuko-san would have no choice\Nbut to pay to keep her quiet.
0.5;It's because she didn't want anyone else to\Nanswer and discover it was a re-delivery.
0.5;But, mister, why did Shuko-san\Nreturn the incense burner?
0.5;That's what Shuko-san said\Nwhen she invited you out.
0.5;By any means necessary, my father-in-law\Nwould take my child from me.
0.5;You, Kazuma, and I can start\Na new family together.
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shooting comet!
0.5;"Yeah. I'd flat out say,\N""You did it!"""
0.5;I'd have tried my utmost to\Nprove that they didn't do it first...
0.5;he left the room and set the\Nsecurity lock using this trick!
0.5;Kamijo-san, who was in\Nthe pub with Mori-san...
0.5;I remember her call well. It was right\Nafter I heard people screaming.
0.5;He supposedly used the phone\Nfor online access until after 10:00.
0.5;Yes. They rushed to the front of\Nthe crowd after hearing someone fell.
0.5;Maeda-san was with us in\Nthe observation lounge,
0.5;Then why didn't he mention\Nit when he was questioned?!
0.5;The detective wants you to do\Nthis stuff in the suspects' rooms.
0.5;are Maeda-san, who was in\Nthe observation lounge,
0.5;Meaning the most suspect are...\Nthe blankets lying by the statue!
0.5;Room 2102's Kamijo-san,\NRoom 2002's Konno-san, and--
0.5;Maeda-san stole the Night Baron\Ncostume and ran into her
0.5;there are no\Nunsolvable mysteries!
0.5;I shouldn't have told you\Nthat the game would do well
0.5;But that was back\Nin college. It's in the past.
0.5;to give ordinary people an\Nimpression of our company.
0.5;That's the logo for\NNakajima-san's company.
0.5;I heard his accent in the\Nbathroom right before he died:
0.5;I actually received a\Nstrange letter three days ago.
0.5;Which means the\Nother person in the deal
0.5;why did they choose\Nthis place to make the deal?
0.5;And the fact that the key doesn't\Nmatch the briefcase bothers me.
0.5;I have an idea who\Nthe bomber might be,
0.5;The person the victim was making a\Ndeal with gave him the briefcase...
0.5;and then exchanging\Nnumber tags afterward.
0.5;so it was certain that\Nhe would be in the 90's too.
0.5;And it was a Mantendo\Noriginal briefcase that exploded.
0.5;I think your wisest choice\Nwould be to tell us everything
0.5;a list of the world's top\Nprogrammers
0.5;The only reason I was able to win this\Naward is because of the director, staff,
0.5;These elevator shoes are killing my feet,\Nand the voice changer makes my neck itch.
0.5;I save money on food, and\Nit's a good change of pace.
0.5;and placed a cup of tea with lemon\Njuice on the coaster without a skull.
0.5;Gin seemed concerned about\Nrats in the Organization.
0.5;Yeah. The professor drew the skulls\Nwith an erasable pen, right?
0.5;The frictional heat generated by rubbing\Nthe ink with rubber makes it disappear.
0.5;In any case, tell James\Nsomeone big is on the move.
0.5;If I turn this on with my\Nphone when I leave the house,
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;If it happened twice,\Nit could happen a third time.
0.5;Unless we can figure out\Nwhy this is happening.
0.5;You look into anything\Nthat makes you curious.
0.5;I set up a camera watching Poirot\Nfor three days after that.
0.5;during the time we couldn't\Nsee inside the store.
0.5;Yeah, but cars pass by even on\Ndays when the cakes don't melt.
0.5;This kettle expels steam\Nwhen the water boils, right?
0.5;We'd better tell the professor to\Nchange the frequency of his drone.
0.5;I came to check on my coworker\Nwho lives in this apartment,
0.5;but I forgot his room\Nnumber, so I texted him.
0.5;You sure do love to meddle\Nin other people's business.
0.5;Yeah. When we arrived,\NYamanashi-san was sitting here.
0.5;In other words, didn't he do it so\Nthe body would be discovered quickly?
0.5;So the man came here, attacked\NKusano-san, and left.
0.5;For the time being, we'll have to keep\Nall manner of possibilities in mind.
0.5;Did you retrieve the belongings\Nthat were in the drain?
0.5;You've probably had plenty of\Nchances to kill him until now.
0.5;Three days ago, this was here when\NI arrived for work in the morning.
0.5;It takes five minutes by\Nboat. I'll take you there.
0.5;It's mentioned in the\NKojiki and Nihon Shoki.
0.5;And don't tell anyone I\Nwas sitting in his chair.
0.5;Maybe he was trying to say\N“dora musuko” (lazy son).
0.5;Izumi-san, do you have any idea\Nwhere Torahiko-san might be?
0.5;Simply place a lavender-scented\Npiece of paper in the bookshelf,
0.5;but all together they'd\Nbe worth over 200,000 yen.
0.5;No. Apparently the husband asked\Nthat she not sell the rare books,
0.5;You came to get some books\Nappraised the other day.
0.5;What does it matter? Hurry\Nup and appraise them.
0.5;A cerebral contusion caused\Nby a blow to the head.
0.5;But I think it had something\Nto do with those books.
0.5;In other words, the cream was applied\Nafter the victim was struck.
0.5;Okay! Here goes!\NCatch it, you guys!
0.5;No, no, Mori-kun.\NThese children discovered the body.
0.5;There it is!\NIt even has a ginkgo tree!
0.5;Come to think of it, a rich\Nbanker by the name of Hayase
0.5;Back then, there were rumors that\Nhe embezzled huge sums of money.
0.5;The embezzled money\Ncouldn't be tracked down,
0.5;Incidentally,\Ndid Mr. Hayase do paintings?
0.5;One year ago, Mr. Hayase went\Ninto the mountains to paint
0.5;You even hired a cleaning\Ncompany to be extra sure!
0.5;Are you sure about this, Mori-kun?\NYou have proof, I hope?!
0.5;I'm glad she's gaining more\Nfans, but as her manager,
0.5;I'm worried some thugs\Nmight try to attack her.
0.5;Got it. Along the canal towards\Nthe clock tower, right?
0.5;That if nothing changed, something\Nterrible would happen at the concert.
0.5;We believe it was the\Ndelusion of a maniacal fan.
0.5;Someone appears to have been kidnapped\Nfrom idol-singer Risa Purple-san's concert.
0.5;So the kidnapper was riding\Nin the car Mori-san took?
0.5;There was a refrigerator in the\Nback of the recycling truck,
0.5;Ran-neechan was trapped inside\Nthe refrigerator in the back.
0.5;Damn! I can't believe I didn't realize Ran\Nand the kidnappers were riding with me!
0.5;"""Pull the fire alarm\Nand cause a commotion?"""
0.5;Next time, the old man\Nand I will take them on!
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Last year someone who went foraging for\Nwild vegetables was attacked by a bear.
0.5;Dad, why don't you stop\Ndrinking and eat something?
0.5;Only someone who frequently\Nentered the temple
0.5;but when I considered all he'd\Ndone for me, I couldn't refuse.
0.5;In other words, only the killer\Ncould have put the powder there.
0.5;It must be the Birinmon\NFish Market in that area.
0.5;They were destroyed in the war,\Nand now this place is a park.
0.5;It's a flier for traffic restrictions on\Nthe day of the Ghost Chimney Festival.
0.5;To see who could hold going\Nto the bathroom longer.
0.5;This is the only place where cars\Ncan park near the festival grounds.
0.5;Damn! Their plan was to disguise themselves as\Nthe agents from the start and steal the money!
0.5;The Case of the\NMysterious Murder Weapon.
0.5;It's nice to take a leisurely\Nwalk together once in a while!
0.5;I take it you're\Nthe one who screamed?
0.5;The killer most likely lifted\Nup a flower pot from behind him
0.5;Will you ever learn to stop\Nbutting in during our investigations?!
0.5;when Mori-kun and\Nthe others came rushing in...
0.5;Terasawa. I live on\Nthe 5th floor of this building.
0.5;And the only ones who\Nentered besides the victim...
0.5;Moreover, each of you had a\Ndecent enough motive to kill the victim.
0.5;More precisely,\Nit was just after 5:05.
0.5;was to discuss the compensation\Nwith my husband one more time,
0.5;my husband was practicing\NTai Chi on the veranda by himself.
0.5;but there's a possibility\Nyou were actually in his office
0.5;you were on the\Nveranda or in his office,
0.5;killed the victim while\Nshe was in the bathroom,
0.5;It came from the\Narea around this veranda.
0.5;Just because Dobashi heard\Na sound from the handrail
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nthe spot where the bird fell--
0.5;An abandoned building\Nacross the street?
0.5;The murder weapon\Nwasn't a flower pot!
0.5;And he's the former owner\Nof a fishing goods store.
0.5;This is the spot where\Nthe victim collapsed.
0.5;Have any of you\Never been here before?
0.5;"It's a type of fishing that\Nuses a so-called ""spinning reel"""
0.5;The killer didn't realize the weight\Nhad left a mark when it happened.
0.5;Sometimes after fishermen\Nconnect fishing rods together,
0.5;What's so fun about\Ncatching fish, anyway?
0.5;Next episode the men in\Nblack make an appearance.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the\Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;You had nowhere left to run,\Nbut according to local authorities,
0.5;That masterpiece will go\Ndown in cinematic history!
0.5;So, Someya, if you're hiding\Nsomething, we're connected now.
0.5;The woman sitting over there\Nwhile you were fighting.
0.5;The officer picked up the\Nkeys to my handcuffs.
0.5;If you're looking for Nashimoto-san, he's\Napparently at the abandoned Haido-cho factory.
0.5;Someya-san caused the incident because\Nhe was trying to protect her.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is\N""Three First Discoverers, Part One!"""
0.5;The hostage's safety\Nis the most important.
0.5;If the mini-van fell front-first,\Nthen why is only the side window broken?
0.5;Could you explain the circumstances\Nunder which she was kidnapped?
0.5;since her real mother\Nhad died when she was young.
0.5;Conan-kun!\NDon't get on without permission!
0.5;while the police were focusing\Ntheir attention on the mini-van.
0.5;We only found enough scuba\Ndiving equipment for one person.
0.5;How did the kidnapper\Nget her out of the sunken car?
0.5;Maybe that man\Nmistook it for another boat...
0.5;This is what you want, isn't it?!\NYour cancellation fee.
0.5;Please don't tell anyone\Nabout this, Conan-kun.
0.5;Say, what did the\Nkidnapper tell you guys?
0.5;There was no way\Nto see her face clearly!
0.5;My father killed himself,\Nand he took his wife and son with him...
0.5;Takei Naoko was being held\Nin the basement of the old factory.
0.5;We found three of these\Nin different locations.
0.5;that appear randomly organized showing how\Nrearranging them according to certain rules
0.5;that happened at a certain\Ncollege one year ago.
0.5;The police arrested the\Nprofessor's assistant,

0.5;The suspect confessed to his crime,\Nand he was found guilty in court.
0.5;The American edition and\Nthe Japanese edition...
0.5;I just received word from\Nsomeone who found the codebook.
0.5;11 corresponds to K and 9\Ncorresponds to I, spelling KI.
0.5;Even after she was dismissed,\Nrather than moving on,
0.5;on her brother's case that she always\Ncarried with her and left a coded message,
0.5;You're just a detective. You\Nshould've stayed out of this!

0.5;How convenient that he\Nstabbed that awful nuisance.
0.5;Didn't you spend days examining the\Ncontents of the storehouse, Chino-sensei?
0.5;So it's hard to imagine Bando-san\Nwent to talk to Amagi-san last night.
0.5;It would be a different story\Nif he had some kind of treasure.

0.5;Where were you 40 to 50 minutes ago,\Naround 8:00 PM?
0.5;Say, was that flower\Nreally here on the floor?
0.5;Joji-sama made it all himself.\NHe runs his own French restaurant.

0.5;the murder weapon was a\Nsteel pipe or something similar.

0.5;Sorry I'm late.\NSo, what do we have?
0.5;They're both characteristics\Nof a drowning, right?
0.5;What happened to\NSaijo-kun was terrible,
0.5;The problem is\Nthat old man's testimony...

0.5;After knocking Saijo-san out\Nwith a chloroform-soaked rag,

0.5;I heard that she was upset that Yoko\Ngot her role in a drama series...
0.5;Judging from the scene of the crime,\Nthe murderer must be Yoko Okino!
0.5;The superintendent also said that\Nhe's seen someone who looks like you!
0.5;You think I'm the murderer\Njust because of an earring?!
0.5;I already told you I've\Nnever been here before!

0.5;Eh?! Then they're\Ngoing to be demolished?!
0.5;It's very possible. And the\Nbody would be found right away.
0.5;And one must've fallen out\Nand sprouted after she was buried...
0.5;I snapped that night when\Nshe refused to compensate me...

0.5;There's nothing romantic\Nabout our relationship.
0.5;But we don't have any\Nclues to their identity.
0.5;But it didn't go as planned when\NOtsubo Kikuhide-san arrived.
0.5;Otsubo-san decided to follow\NKochiyama-san instead.

0.5;The cause of death of Amanda Hughes,\Na wealthy American woman killed

0.5;But what would that mirror be\Ndoing in Haneda Koji's room?
0.5;It says the sink in the bathroom\Nwas left running, too.
0.5;and owner of the house, Hiyama\NKunihisa-san, sixty-one years old.
0.5;Can we assume the victim\Nthrew this cup at his killer
0.5;I thought he was holding them because\Nhe recorded the killer's voice.
0.5;It's very similar to the murder of\NHaneda Kenji seventeen years ago.
0.5;I ended up in the hospital\Nuntil last week because of it.
0.5;Then you saw Hiyama-san\Nbleeding from the head
0.5;Then I punctured my foot\Nwhen I ran to the body.
0.5;If I hit someone hard enough to make\Nthem bleed, I'd have blood on me.
0.5;I-In any case, I didn't have a blunt\Nobject that could serve as the weapon!
0.5;The police are pursuing him, and it's only\Na matter of time before the case is solved.
0.5;I'm an apprentice in traditional\NKanazawa gold foil crafts.
0.5;Why didn't you mention\Nsomething so important?
0.5;He resents your father because he\Nfailed to steal the money once.

0.5;If you want him returned safely,\Ngive me back my 30 million!
0.5;There weren't any clues identifying\Nthe location in the photo.
0.5;Conan-kun, did you come here\Nknowing Manabu-san would be here?
0.5;Because he wasn't concerned about him\Ncalling for help even if he had a phone on him.
0.5;Congratulations on your\Ndischarge from the hospital.
0.5;and Kochiyama-san plans to\Nget more likes out of him.
0.5;They must be feeling really bad\Nabout the stupid thing they did.
0.5;Like he was hoping he'd\Nreceive more money, right?
0.5;I'm going to find this\Nunlucky man and follow him.
0.5;Otsubo-san came to Beika City and suffered\Ncollateral damage not by coincidence,

0.5;At the concert, two men mistook\NRan for Risa and kidnapped her.
0.5;Then the old man and I pursued the kidnappers\Nand tracked down their hideout.
0.5;the more capable they are of just about\Nanything when they feel cornered.
0.5;That's why she always shows the left side\Nof her face in every picture she takes.
0.5;But places that people are likely to\Nillegally dump garbage are hard to spot.
0.5;I don't think you'll be able to find it\Nby searching at night with a helicopter.
0.5;Could you broadcast my message to\Nthe kidnappers on your program?
0.5;Very well. We'll start making\Npreparations immediately.
0.5;from the father of kidnapping victim Mori\NRan-san, Mori Kogoro-san, to the kidnappers.
0.5;But to me, my daughter is\Nan irreplaceable treasure.
0.5;I hope it reaches the\Nconsciences of the kidnappers.
0.5;They left evidence on\Nthis answering machine.
0.5;You should be worrying about\NRisa-chan, not your bonus.
0.5;Watch where\Nyou're walking, Mister!
0.5;And that guy's been on\Nthe pay phone for a while...
0.5;I can let you hear it all,\Nif you'd like!
0.5;Split up and question\Npeople in the area!
0.5;Afterwards, while dining\Nwith you children,
0.5;Yeah. After she got\Nthe call and went outside,
0.5;Yes. They said they had kidnapped\NTwo-Mix and to call the police...
0.5;Alright. Try not to\Nagitate the kidnappers.
0.5;I know they're in\Nthe direction of Haido,
0.5;But, why make the kids bring it?\NEspecially with police escorts?
0.5;Who did he say\Nto give the tape to?!
0.5;I saw a strange duo going\Nup to the detective agency.
0.5;But doesn't searching for\Nburied treasure sound scary?
0.5;I'm looking forward to unearthing\Nthis buried treasure.
0.5;Yes, well, I also invited\Nhistorians and archaeologists,
0.5;During the war, when Ieyasu was\Nnearly captured by Imagawa,
0.5;I'm a documentary writer who\Ntravels across the country
0.5;who described in such grotesque detail\Nthe death of a man eaten by a monster.
0.5;I see. He's making a video\Nto revitalize his town.
0.5;You're not defending the law or\Njustice, just the life of the package.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the\Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;I hired you to be my bodyguard so\Nyou could simultaneously protect me,
0.5;It's the reason I trained with the security\Ncompany affiliated with your agency.
0.5;We work at the same agency, but\Nwe get along like cats and dogs.
0.5;It's hard to believe they're\Nlike cats and dogs.
0.5;He said there are lots of other\Npeople who resent Ryo-san.
0.5;She plotted to make up a\Nstory the media would love.
0.5;as well as where a boat would get\Nwashed up when the fog was out.
0.5;You did this to prove to\Nyourself that you're a father!
0.5;My mind is that of a\Nformer great detective,
0.5;Those two guys who tried to pick us up\Nat the coffee shop that one Sunday!
0.5;If you have any problems,\Njust leave it to us!
0.5;Would you come with me\Nto tomorrow's Valentine party?
0.5;Of course. The party is taking place\Nat his house, after all.
0.5;We'll come! Ran and\NI will both come for sure!
0.5;Now that I think about it,\Nthere was a guy by that name...
0.5;Sonoko-san. You're still young, but you\Nshouldn't go overboard like that...
0.5;She actually looks\Nlike she's having fun.
0.5;I guess you really do\Nlike Yoshimi the best...
0.5;Don't you think maybe\Nyou're smoking too much?
0.5;Everyone drank coffee that\Ncame from the same pot.
0.5;I saw it! When Minagawa-san\Nwent outside,
0.5;He did indeed plan to murder\Nthe victim, but he failed.
0.5;you decided to use the fact that\NYoshimi-san loved him to your advantage!
0.5;and replaced it with\Npoisoned chocolate!
0.5;That's how you knew for sure\Nthat he would eat her chocolate!
0.5;He sounded and acted exactly\Nlike the professor.
0.5;There's hardly any in reserve\Nin the storehouse either.
0.5;I heard a teacher once got locked\Ninside and starved to death in there.
0.5;because of feng shui or something\Non the day of the graduation...
0.5;on the vaulting box at\Nthe bottom of the steps.
0.5;wrap it around a rod,\Nand write something on it.
0.5;But I've never seen the\Nother characters before.
0.5;Yeah. Based on what Detective\NYui said, probably.
0.5;Inspector Morofushi said it was\Npossible if they imagined themselves
0.5;Yeah. That's why Lieutenant Kano\Nsaid what he did at the shrine.
0.5;hid the head inside his hood, and released\Nit along with fake blood as he was falling.
0.5;He was just holding the crisscrossed\Nrope in front of his neck.
0.5;He e-mailed his own phone using Inspector\NTakeda's, his first victim's, phone,
0.5;making it look like Inspector\NYamato summoned him.
0.5;And after burning Takeda's\Nbody, I'll disappear.
0.5;In other words, my friend\Nwho got high on drugs,
0.5;You deliberately made Kano-san realize this\Nso he'd go home and you could kill him.
0.5;It's your fault for having\Nsuch a stupid friend.
0.5;so you'd hear them so you'd let your\Nguard down and we could nail you here.
0.5;Morofushi's car will be a bit tight\Nwith the spare tire in the back.
0.5;and I saw the e-mail you sent\NInspector Morofushi, I...
0.5;is stuffing yourself with foods\Nthat can only be acquired locally.
0.5;There's actually something\NI'd like to tell you.
0.5;Which means someone poisoned\Nthe bathroom beforehand
0.5;That's right. Besides, why would\Nsomeone choose to kill him like that?
0.5;So Ogami-san killed himself because\Nhe thought he'd be discovered?
0.5;Nakatani-san knows barely\Nanything about fossils.
0.5;It's hard to believe the victim\Nwould've drunk the poison himself.
0.5;it reacts with your stomach\Nacid, creating a poisonous gas.
0.5;The acid was added not by the\Nculprit, but by Ogami-san himself.
0.5;The bugs gathered around the fan\Nmust have inhaled the poisonous gas.
0.5;know that my spirit will\Nsomeday be revived with the snow!
0.5;Hello! I made a\Nreservation the other day!
0.5;Yes, yes! Kinoshita Akiko-san\Nand Asanuma Yoko-san, yes?
0.5;You were just so\Nafraid of the Snow Woman
0.5;What do you say to\Nhaving an after-bath drink?
0.5;But, mister! Akiko-san made\Na beauty salon appointment!
0.5;Kinoshita Akiko-san's death\Nwas a murder, not a suicide!
0.5;Mori-san! You know Akiko-san\Nwasn't in a normal state of mind!
0.5;If Akiko-san had killed\Nherself after 10:00 last night,
0.5;And no one else but you\Ncould have done that, Yoko-san!
0.5;You then put on Akiko-san's\Nski boots, which you had hidden,
0.5;You also played the role of two\Npeople for us in the open-air bath.
0.5;Conan-kun, you know something\Nabout everything.
0.5;High school girl detective\NSonoko is fired up!
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;I found the North Star and was\Nlooking directly beneath it.
0.5;And could you have seen that flowerbed\Nfrom the top of the slide?
0.5;We get some willful clients\Nsometimes. It's a hassle.
0.5;He's repairing the front of\Nthis building in the meantime.
0.5;Someone must've dug up\Nthe dirt to bury a body.
0.5;By the time Sonoko looked\Nthrough her binoculars,
0.5;Besides, even if there was\Na body, who killed them?
0.5;But she was asked to return\Nto the studio by Sasaki-san.
0.5;Sasaki-san would've found\Nher if she came downstairs.
0.5;of the Yoshimura building when\Nthey were finished with it
0.5;Anyway, I'm impressed that\Nyou figured out who did it.
0.5;You were captivated by pachinko\Nwhile I was having an emergency.
0.5;they ask for information about\Nthe person besides their name.
0.5;and I don't have many opportunities\Nto speak with other patients.
0.5;Do you keep all your old\Nphotos on your phone?
0.5;I thought my son had a simple cold during\Nhis exams, but it turned out to be the flu.
0.5;The cause of death seems to be\Nasphyxiation caused by cyanide poison.
0.5;And look closely at the\Ncolor of everyone's tea.
0.5;The culprit may still have\Nit on their person, too.
0.5;As the person who suggested you compare\Nteas and then made the tea,
0.5;"and Beppu-san was drinking a\Nyellow herb tea called ""Chamomile."""
0.5;but I was disappointed\Nwhen I saw it was brown.
0.5;Juri's son failed his entrance\Nexam because of Reina.
0.5;In other words, everyone\Nhad motive to kill the victim.
0.5;Did anyone leave the room once\Nyou started drinking tea?
0.5;Mistake #1: Cans scattered around\Nthe waste bin in an unnatural fashion.
0.5;Mistake #2: The ice cream bar you\Nwere just eating is lying nearby.
0.5;I hate running away\Nand hiding from people!
0.5;I'm asking you how you\Nfeel about her as a girl!
0.5;Mitsuhiko... Don't tell me you\Nhave a crush on Ayumi-chan...
0.5;You're so lucky! The professor\Nmakes so much stuff for you!
0.5;Is there anything else\Nbesides the money?
0.5;when he fell down the stairs\Nthe other day and got two bumps!
0.5;We can't leave her alive!\NEven if she is just a kid!
0.5;This is bad! There's no catching them\Nif they get on the freeway!
0.5;...the kidnappers appear to have\Nescaped to the city of Beika.
0.5;Ayumi-chan! Have you\Nheard any police cars?!
0.5;You idiot! They wouldn't dare\Ngo through the checkpoint!
0.5;We're currently giving away\NMasked Yaiba towels and T-shirts...
0.5;He can't stand up straight,\Nand he keeps blowing his lines!
0.5;Since only Heiji won in yesterday's\Nsemifinal team match,
0.5;But it seems like he should be able\Nto win today's individual match.
0.5;It sounds like they still\Nhave another target.
0.5;B-Because I don't want to get\Ninvolved in the case, obviously.
0.5;Yeah. Since the uniform can be worn over\Nyour clothes, we can't expect much.
0.5;We've got forty minutes\Nbefore the matches start.
0.5;That means if Hattori-kun\Nwins this tournament
0.5;and Detectives Takagi and Chiba's\Nreasoning cast suspicion
0.5;It's hard to imagine someone\Nwho likes mysteries
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;I'm going to lock myself in my\Nstudy and stay up all night again.
0.5;Kogoro-no-ojisan told me\Nto ask, so I don't know.
0.5;She probably only bought them when\Nher favorite authors were featured.
0.5;"The copy of ""Mystery World"" she\Nhad was last year's May issue."
0.5;they casually commit murders one\Nafter another to avoid them.
0.5;Kogoro-no-ojisan wanted\Nme to ask you a question.
0.5;"They're the author of a ridiculous\Nstory ""The Melting Weapon."""
0.5;They also had to be able to\Nsteal Chino-sensei's lighter.
0.5;who were at my café yesterday\Nare the most suspicious.
0.5;despite being the neighborhood\Nassociation president.
0.5;Inside those books was the\Nclue to solving the mystery.
0.5;All of Dorosue Yamiyo's works were\Nrejected in the first round of judgment,
0.5;It's from when I bought the\Nawl I used on Amagi-san
0.5;How does the slug conveniently\Nmake its way to the victim?
0.5;and the suspect was never\Narrested, the incidents stopped.
0.5;And one year later, in the same places\Nusing the same methods, it's started again.
0.5;You just had three pork buns\Nfrom the convenience store!
0.5;wouldn't the police have arrested\Nthe arsonist a long time ago?
0.5;"Is it counting down\N""irohanihoheto"" backwards?"
0.5;That's the roof above\Nthe collection room...
0.5;Hamura-san. Perhaps you secretly\Nhad the stake when that happened?
0.5;Dorakura... His talent had\Nbeen dried up for years now.
0.5;didn't Mr. Dorakura start publishing\Nfantasy works five years ago?
0.5;I have a sister named Kaori,\Nwho's ten years younger than me.
0.5;I knew it! There's a\Nslight smell of oil paint left!
0.5;There wasn't a single footstep\Nin the snow outside, you know.
0.5;There were no footprints because\Nthe killer walked through the air.
0.5;The killer used that fact to\Nmake a bridge...
0.5;But, Mori-san! The stake was\Ntwo meters from that window!
0.5;The killer attached one and stuck\Nit through the ventilation window
0.5;This turned up after I instructed\NConan to look through the storeroom.
0.5;Then how could I have\Nlocked it from the outside?!
0.5;The square holes in\Nthe film, in other words.
0.5;When he was in the dressing room,\Nthe flower on his chest was--
0.5;Higashio Maria-chan missed class at Teitan\NElementary School without any notice.
0.5;from her dead grandma in\Nher desk drawer the other day.
0.5;Believing Maria-chan went to her dead\Ngrandmother's house to look for treasure,
0.5;Everyone's talking about your\Nboyfriend online right now.
0.5;Maria-chan must have stayed in this\Nroom when she came to this house.
0.5;Then the next one must\Nbe in the room next door.
0.5;but the arrow pointed to\Nan empty shower room.
0.5;Does it make any noise when\Nyou push or pull on the knob?
0.5;The air pressure is keeping\Nthe door shut from the inside.
0.5;I was going to go to school\Nafter watching this video,
0.5;I'm the one who said she saw Kudo\NShinichi-kun at Kiyomizu Temple.
0.5;I think that was a hallucination\Nproduced by my own desires.
0.5;so that should be the end of\Nthe Kudo Shinichi disturbance.
0.5;The administrator of the blog said she\Nsaw you kissing at the Kiyomizu butai.
0.5;Your voice was trembling when you\Nreceived the award last year.
0.5;The coating on his fingers\Nmade them slippery.
0.5;He could easily create a device that would\Nshoot blood out when a blank was fired.
0.5;Now that they know Shu's alive, they'll\Ncapture and use us as bait to draw out Shu.
0.5;You're both fathers, so\Nwhy are you so different?
0.5;The steering wheel keeps\Nturning to the right.
0.5;They knew you'd come to Raiha Pass since\Nyou were beginning to doubt my death.
0.5;There's a good chance that\Nplace was a funeral home, so...
0.5;Conan-kun might be inside\Nthe hearse that just left.
0.5;Could it be related to the\Nrobbery Conan-kun described?
0.5;The hearse and his family\Nleft for the crematorium.
0.5;The person who arranged\Nit isn't working today.
0.5;This is the newest version of\Nthe will the chairman rewrote.
0.5;They wanted to confirm its\Ncontents as soon as possible.
0.5;She would've let us know if\Nsomething had happened.
0.5;An investigator from Hokkaido should\Narrive to ask you about that.
0.5;Was the robber really in\Nthis house for that long?
0.5;I'll save you as many times\Nas I have to, Haibara-san!
0.5;All he thinks about is mysteries.\NHe'd never be that good-for-nothing.
0.5;"A policeman called it\N""aconitine,"" or something."
0.5;Wolfsbane is used in Chinese medicines,\Nminus the poison, of course!
0.5;My husband, Tsukumo Motoyasu,\Nwas maybe even world-renowned.
0.5;He hasn't been a pupil for very\Nlong and isn't as skilled as the others,
0.5;But, those three were at home\Nbefore leaving for the show, right?
0.5;Wouldn't they have had\Nthe chance to poison him?
0.5;and I've never seen\Na prop like this before!
0.5;Then, there are those\Nstrange cards. Or so I'd surmise.
0.5;But, isn't this just a prop?\NPlus, the police said it was a suicide.
0.5;on that ship during the 60th\Nanniversary party of the Suzuki zaibatsu!
0.5;Come on.\NKids should play with kids.
0.5;No. I told her he's\Ndoing a show overseas...
0.5;That's strange for her\Nto mistake her pigeons...
0.5;Oh, you're right. Was it my husband?\NHe was especially fond of him.
0.5;In short, nobody would be able to\Nhear shouts coming from this room?
0.5;the body seemed a bit odd\Nfor someone who was poisoned.
0.5;But, he only had the rings on.\NThere weren't any strings.
0.5;"""One two six eight seven\None three two four eight nine..."""
0.5;How long're you\Ngonna look at those numbers?
0.5;The killer also hid\Nthe phone with the cards.
0.5;But the pens were gone,\Nand the phone unplugged.
0.5;Plus, if the phone stood out too much,\Nthe killer might get rid of it.
0.5;Wait a minute! Then the\Nnext one, 3-2-4-8-9 is C!
0.5;You know, the D.C.\Nthat's often in sheet music!
0.5;It means to go back\Nto the start and repeat.
0.5;Yes. She probably plans\Nto kill your daughter.
0.5;I thought something was up,\Nbut I never imagined she'd kill.
0.5;Immediately after, my brother\Ndrowned in the practice water tank,
0.5;Oh no! If Mom blurts\Nout too much now...
0.5;H-He must've picked up\Nsome of Shinichi's qualities!
0.5;I'll make you a yummy\NSalisbury steak as an apology!
0.5;Oh, that's some way to talk\Nto the person who saved your life.
0.5;but he went to Brazil\Nbefore I entered grade school, so...
0.5;But, why are you\Nso suspicious of him?
0.5;This is from the city\Nbaseball tournament!
0.5;Yes. But I can't remember\Nif our uncle was left-handed or not.
0.5;See? The handwriting matches\Nexactly with what he wrote just now!
0.5;We were going to destroy\Nthe well because it was dangerous,
0.5;Our mom's brother\Nsuddenly caused a scene!
0.5;I'm sorry to bother you by staying here\Nand having you make such a nice meal!
0.5;Oh, what's wrong\Nwith that? It has elegance.
0.5;Did anyone leave the\Nroom while I was in the bath?
0.5;We haven't found\Nthe murder weapon yet,
0.5;she wouldn't be\Nback until after 10:00.
0.5;Yep! I was the only one not with them,\Nbecause I was in the bath!
0.5;Yeah. There are too many\Nmysteries scattered about.
0.5;Come on. Let's get back\Nto our room and sleep.
0.5;The greedier you are,\Nthe more noise you make.
0.5;Is pain the only way\Nto get through to you?
0.5;The reading of Yabuuchi Yoshichika's\Nlast will will now take place.
0.5;...and that he held a grudge\Nagainst our Yabuuchi family...
0.5;Does that mean\Nanyone would've done, then?
0.5;So, there's still another cretin out\Nto take my life. Heaven help me.
0.5;In any case, I don't think\Nwe'll be able to solve this case
0.5;Fine, then! I'll figure it out\Non my own! Who needs you?!
0.5;but oddly enough, it appears\Nshe had held it as you would a sword.
0.5;This door will take you straight\Nfrom the bath to the stove.
0.5;And this stove is right next to the well,\Nwhere the body was hidden!
0.5;before we even opened the cabinet\Nand found a bow gun inside.
0.5;The person who murdered\NMachiko-san and hid her in the well...
0.5;But she wound up being\Nkilled by that person instead.
0.5;Ironically, her trick wound up\Nhelping the alibi of her killer instead.
0.5;She had it in her pocket so she could\Ndrop it at the murder scene later
0.5;to make it look connected\Nto the incident fifteen years ago.
0.5;So, there's still another\Ncretin out to take my life.
0.5;That clearly indicates\Nsomeone had attacked him before.
0.5;In short, Machiko-san\Nhad also sent a threat letter.
0.5;I divide my inheritance between\Nthe following six people:
0.5;If that was his intent,\Nhe wouldn't have taken on the role
0.5;To have the intimidators'\Nattacks focused on him instead.
0.5;he would've been taken\Naway by the police for questioning.
0.5;or that this was his\Nfather's family's home.
0.5;It seems you still lack in the\Nobservation department, Shinichi-kun!
0.5;I kept calling Shinichi's\Nhouse but no one was there!
0.5;Last year, you and Ebizo-san wished\Nthem a Happy New Year yourselves!
0.5;We hope you'll continue\Nsupporting Detective Conan...
0.5;But... I don't want to get\Nthe police involved.
0.5;Since he's not answering his\Nphone, I don't have a choice.
0.5;and the other side of the\Nstreet, little by little.
0.5;We'll start with the eldest\Nson, Kozo-san, was it?
0.5;He was called early this morning\Nby a resident of the building.
0.5;Uchida Asami\Nwas asleep in the lodge!
0.5;None of the people in the\Nkaraoke booth could've done it!
0.5;I heard she was in the tennis club\Nuntil her 2nd year of middle school.
0.5;And if my theory is right, the\Nevidence is still in their possession!
0.5;Yeah! She was in\Nbed just a minute ago!
0.5;What if it was something\Nnot out of the ordinary?
0.5;The burned remnants\Nof that fax were also found.
0.5;The date, time, phone number,\Nand your fingerprints are on it.
0.5;Just a small fire?!\NIt spread faster than you thought?!
0.5;Why couldn't you imagine\NAsami-san possibly burning to death?!
0.5;I bet you could capture any\Nman with a single breath, though.
0.5;Hmm. I didn't really\Ntake notice of him at first.
0.5;That hurt my feelings, so I baked\Na new one every day for three months
0.5;with the body of a child\Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Apparently my husband\Nstuck the instructions
0.5;I'd like you to find that paper\Nwithin the books I've given to you.
0.5;I doubt you'd be able to open\Na Samizu Kichiemon trick box.
0.5;Turtlenecks are just about the only thing\Nthat cover his choker-shaped voice changer.
0.5;Moonstones that produce that\Noptical phenomenon are valuable.
0.5;countless cookbooks for me\Nsince I loved to cook so much.
0.5;Why does a famous detective like\Nmyself have to look for lost cats?
0.5;Even heaven is watching the\Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;The camera in the emergency\Nstaircase was broken.
0.5;I think we can assume it was\Nused to commit the crime.
0.5;they were able to confirm that the\Nclothes worn during the murder
0.5;she threw away the evidence\Nin the dumpster.
0.5;Hori Maiko-san's fingerprints\Nwere found on the tape, though.
0.5;Since we've determined the identity\Nof the culprit, that should be fine.
0.5;There are too many clothes relative\Nto the volume of the closet.
0.5;Could you show us the\Ncontents of your bag, then?
0.5;I took the emergency staircase\Nto Saki's apartment.
0.5;participants would have acquired all the\Nhints necessary to solve the mystery by now.
0.5;Akiyama-san's injury wasn't\Nthat serious, then.
0.5;Was Akiyama-san's hidden\Ncamera inside her watch?
0.5;When Conan said he wanted to see\Nthe film you had secretly taken,
0.5;If you place the two symbols\Non top of one another,
0.5;"As you know, ""hoshi"" or ""star""\Nmeans the culprit in police terminology."
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;"""The Memories of\NFirst Love Case (Part 1)."""
0.5;Plus, you're supposed to follow\Nthe tiles when sweeping the floor!
0.5;You're so dumb!\NIt's obviously Shinichi-kun!
0.5;What're you so embarrassed about?\NHurry and see him!
0.5;If Shinichi-niichan won't go,\Nwhy not ask someone else?
0.5;Oh! Over there?\NMiss Toto isn't too far now! Let's go!
0.5;Speaking of which,\Nwhere is her lemon pie?
0.5;She said she would make\None for me, so I asked her to.
0.5;At any age, watching birthday\Ncandles being lit is so exciting!
0.5;See? It's good we got\Na lodge with a fax machine!
0.5;But you can't blame\NShinichi-kun for falling for her.
0.5;Everyone ran off to the\Nbathrooms by the train station.
0.5;Please be all right,\NAsami-senpai!
0.5;He gave it to me just as\NI was about to run inside.
0.5;He said I should put it on to protect\Nmy hair and face from the flames.

0.5;and it's been going\Non for a whole week now.
0.5;Nothing beats drinking\Nbeer with old friends!
0.5;Could you explain the\Nsituation as you found it?
0.5;But it was really\Ntoo dark to see much...
0.5;Didn't you say Ikuta\Ntook your money?
0.5;Ikuta-san stole your tuition\Nmoney and refused to give it back.
0.5;I was in here the whole time!\NRight, Shimizu?
0.5;There was blood\Non the pieces of glass.
0.5;Before I explain,\NI'd like you to check something.
0.5;directly above\Nthe bloodstain on the wall.
0.5;"It's only a dozen meters away;\Nthe length of a few taxicabs."
0.5;Ran. Tie the bag to\Nthe other end of the rope.
0.5;and then pulled the\Nrope in to recover the weapon.
0.5;Takeno-san. You aimed\Nat the light from the cigarette
0.5;As I said, sometimes you have to\Nabandon friends in mountain accidents.
0.5;No, but I had my forehead\Nbashed into the wall instead.
0.5;You were the teacher for the girl\Nwho killed herself, Mochizuki Minako.
0.5;And, she was Nakamura-sensei's\Nfavorite in the Health Committee.
0.5;and then use my real voice\Nto explain it over the phone...
0.5;Conan-kun told me.\NNow, I need you to do something.
0.5;Explain the truth\Nto everyone in my place!
0.5;You tie the rubber\Nband to one end of the line,
0.5;Naturally, you measure the line so\Nhe'll stop just before the doorbell.
0.5;So, the killer murdered Sugiyama-sensei\Nhours before so he'd be stiff?
0.5;we would've thought the killer\Nhad fled downstairs with the weapon,
0.5;The next day, she hanged\Nherself in the volleyball room.
0.5;As fellow teachers, they had to pay\Nfor betraying and killing a student
0.5;I'm sorry for being\Nsuch a horrible teacher...
0.5;If we don't locate the kid's\Nfather and the kidnapper right away,
0.5;Conan's logic works great on\Nhearts tired by modern society!
0.5;Where could he be?\NSugiyama-sensei sure is late...
0.5;Pardon me! Are there\Nany lodges around here?
0.5;but don't tell me\Nyou're goin' up there?
0.5;Me. Sugiyama-sensei\Ncalled me last night
0.5;Conan-kun, what're you doing?\NLet's go inside!
0.5;I parked in the forest and waited\Nfor you when a blizzard suddenly hit.
0.5;Dunno. Everyone\Nsuddenly stopped talking...
0.5;Someone covered my mouth from\Nbehind while I was making the bed,
0.5;She must have inhaled\Ntoo much chloroform.
0.5;But who says\Nthe attacker made them?
0.5;Get serious! Myself aside,\NSuzuki-san has been strangled!
0.5;But, I'll never forget what\Nhappened three years ago.
0.5;Alright, Sugiyama!\NWe know you're in here!
0.5;Eh? An incident at Haido\NElementary three years ago?
0.5;So, they want us to sit\Nhere until morning?!
0.5;and he won't get\Nattacked if he's holed up.
0.5;Here you are, Mori-san!\NCoffee and cocoa!
0.5;Three years ago, a girl hanged\Nherself in the volleyball room
0.5;A romantic advice club receives\Nwarnings about incidents to come.
0.5;the club's policy of accepting\Nletters instead of e-mails
0.5;Believing the initials EC referred\Nto herself, Chikada Eimi,
0.5;Based on the escalating threats and time\Nlimit, it didn't seem like a prank.
0.5;Kariya Yuto-kun, valedictorian\Nand hottest guy at school.
0.5;The say they hope nothing\Nworse happens to TB.
0.5;If you're going to apologize,\Nwe'll go with you.
0.5;"I expected him to say something\Nlike ""don't be stupid."""
0.5;My mom won some tickets to a\Ncafé in Kinza in a lottery.
0.5;King Philip IV had all the Knights\NTemplar in France arrested.
0.5;When he was stabbed, some\Nblood flew onto my face.
0.5;My stomach hasn't been feeling\Nwell since this afternoon.
0.5;Listen, detectives, you\Nseem to think we did it.
0.5;When I asked him how he did it, he said\Nit was thanks to my illustrated diary.
0.5;while walking through a shopping\Narea on the way to school.
0.5;Made by renowned watchmaker Soumillon,\Nthere's only five of them in the world.
0.5;Soumillon's masterpiece from\Nthe height of his career.
0.5;All of these systems are\Nmonitored by computer.
0.5;If anything happens, the security\Ncompany will come running.
0.5;I see. With security this tight, it's not\Npossible for your average burglar to break in.
0.5;You're right, Haibara-san.\NIt's certainly possible.
0.5;You mentioned something\Nabout the gears of tragedy.
0.5;Our staff member Sakai takes\Ngreat care of our yard.
0.5;they would've had to pass through this café\Nwhere you could have seen them, correct?
0.5;He seemed nervous and had been behaving\Noddly since he entered the café.
0.5;In other words, you're the\Nonly one who left his seat
0.5;In other words, if Nonaka-san\Nreally did do it,
0.5;Your leading statements made me\Nsuspicious of you from the start.
0.5;What about low sugar and\Nlow—well, whatever.
0.5;I'm sure they'll understand if you\Nexplain your feelings to them.
0.5;All that's left is to\Nfind my father's killer.
0.5;Oide Raita-san was sleeping on\Nthe floor around here, right?
0.5;Did Raita mention having\Nproblems with anyone?
0.5;Your injuries may not have been\Nserious, but it's still a concussion.
0.5;I'll give you some special information\Nif you'll leave me alone.
0.5;on the day of the incident\Nwhen the 4:30 PM notice played.
0.5;but eventually he was overcome by\Nfatigue as he lost consciousness.
0.5;Please be careful as you\Nreturn to your homes.
0.5;just figures and models that\Nfell when the power went out.
0.5;by the loss of power and falling\Nmodels to hit Hanyu-san,
0.5;We're known domestically and internationally\Nfor our products with originality.
0.5;You're right. It doesn't\Nlook like it was moved.
0.5;As the last to arrive, wouldn't you have\Nhad the opportunity to retrieve the remote
0.5;Once you've gotten that through\Nyour head, go do your job.
0.5;O-Oh, I thought he was a\Nkabuki actor or something!
0.5;So, what did someone\Nso great want with you, Dad?
0.5;To keep others from realizing\NI'm investigating a case.
0.5;Just as I'd expect from the\Nwork of a living national treasure!
0.5;I've asked you\Nhere for but one reason:
0.5;Just as I'd expect from a great\Ndetective! You have sharp eyes!
0.5;You're such a joker!\NYou already knew that!
0.5;You have it good! She only okayed\Ntwo of my wares this month!
0.5;But, is it really okay to\Naccept something so valuable?
0.5;Then how about the incident that\Nhappened during my class reunion?
0.5;The seven people in the\Nstateroom forgot all their worries,
0.5;Mori-san! It's morning!\NMori-san!
0.5;She hanged herself just now!\NShe might survive if we get her down!
0.5;But would anyone use\Nsuch important works of art?
0.5;Oh! Then maybe\Nsomeone carried her here?
0.5;Evidence that the killer\Nfailed to hide completely!
0.5;While I was chasing him,\Nthe culprit threw a hose at me.
0.5;they were making a weird sound\Nwith every step they took.
0.5;And if they're still coming\Nhere, that means...
0.5;Boss, could I get a large\NJudge of the Afterlife ramen,
0.5;and an amount equal to the air forced\Nout is sucked in through the other end.
0.5;Apparently the hose\Nbelonged to the homeowner,
0.5;that allows air through but\Ndoesn't have large holes?
0.5;It seemed like they were\Nhaving a lot of fun, though.
0.5;But at the restaurant, she was\Nkidnapped before our very eyes!
0.5;The kidnappers demanded\Nthe bag she left at the restaurant.
0.5;Oh, he said that these\NTracking Glasses should--
0.5;Huh? Where's the guy\Nfrom the coffee shop?
0.5;Hello? Where'd you go,\Nlittle boy? Hello?
0.5;Yeah, they really questioned\Nus about where the tape was...
0.5;The night of New Year's Eve,\Nyou killed a man near Shoenji Temple
0.5;There was a murder near that\Ntemple when the bell rang at 11:50...
0.5;...with his hand on the gun, to leave\Nbehind traces of gunpowder!
0.5;"The ""countdown bell""\Nwas the New Year's bell."
0.5;and the time and place of\Nthe gunshots becomes clear.
0.5;Said he had to stay at the temple\Nto ring the bell, so I let him live.
0.5;But, even if you did call the police,\Nyou'd die before they get here...
0.5;and the two-man gang\Nwas put under arrest.
0.5;Are you crazy?! They'd get\Neven madder if we did that!
0.5;I left Ran's name tag here.\NDo know where it went?
0.5;I wrote his name on it and left it\Non the desk in the study last night.
0.5;Because you're the only one\Nwithout a badge on their clothes.
0.5;While walking in a crosswalk,\Nhold your hand in the air.
0.5;Raise your hand when you're\Nwalking in a crosswalk.
0.5;I'm not listening to someone\Nwearing a weird badge.
0.5;Conan's logic is good medicine\Nfor hearts tired by modern society!
0.5;Today's stage is a significant\Nhospital room! Find the case's virus!
0.5;How lame! Falling down some\Nsteps and breaking a bone!
0.5;especially since you only\Ndropped by on your way to play.
0.5;In that case, why not speak\Nwith Mori Kogoro-san there?
0.5;Say! Are those the\Nguys from the criminal group
0.5;Living the hospital\Nlife isn't all that bad!
0.5;She's having a blast.\NShould I put her on?
0.5;When you deem he's fit enough\Nfor questioning, haul him on over.
0.5;especially after you said you\Nhad to leave to take care of things.
0.5;and someone there is looking\Nthis way through binoculars.
0.5;Dammit! Doesn't look like Genta\Nand the others'll make it in time!
0.5;So was this lady\Nthe person you were with?
0.5;Wasn't there a red person\Nbehind that tree a second ago?
0.5;A long-haired woman wearing a\Nred raincoat and red boots.
0.5;A villa with a bright red\Ndoor and the shadow
0.5;By the time the police heard\Nthe noise and got there,
0.5;I'm sure not many people\Nwant to rent this place.
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “Tragedy\Nof the Red Woman (Evil Spirit)!”
0.5;It looked like she was\Npicking a fight on purpose.
0.5;And with Soichi-san's wife Shuko-san\Nand Kazuma-kun, there's six of you.
0.5;who served as inspiration for\NNanso Satomi Hakkenden.
0.5;where the flower park and\Nhot spring are to Kurayoshi.
0.5;Not only are the police waiting to\Ncatch him when you make the exchange,
0.5;I'm so sorry! He's out\Non a case right now!
0.5;You shouldn't be up here!\NIt's dangerous!
0.5;so I came to see how\Nmuch you've improved.
0.5;Don't worry, Inspector.\NI know who did it.
0.5;Not true. You two\Nused to be an item.
0.5;You two used to argue nearly\Nevery day about her acting!
0.5;Swallowing cyanide means\Na near-instant death!
0.5;Didn't someone give\Nyou the glasses backstage?
0.5;Things wouldn't fit if\NTateoka-san was after Shoko-san!
0.5;Come, now.\NWhat do you think I'm here for?
0.5;The guilty party will be\Nunable to show their hands!
0.5;Guess he gets his women skills\Nfrom his teacher, too.
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills\Nto the secrets of the heart!
0.5;The clear sheet over the ice\Nwas stained black by the ink.
0.5;More importantly, what\Nabout that other thing?
0.5;Well, since Kid already came and\Nleft, let's take a taxi home.
0.5;Looks like I'll have to cover\Nthat ridiculous mouth...
0.5;The floor is wet from the\Nmelted ice, so be careful.
0.5;to make us believe you'd\Nstolen the real ring.
0.5;"Your first person pronoun switched\Nfrom ""atashi"" to ""uchi,"""
0.5;The fake Kazuha didn't have\Nany seaweed in her teeth!
0.5;The details of the event were written\Non the son's blog in Spanish.
0.5;The writing on the note had bled,\Nso it was pretty hard to read.
0.5;Because unlike Date-san, I became a\Npolice officer before Matsuda-kun.
0.5;High school student Shinichi was forced\Nto take a drug that shrunk him.
0.5;and he's been missing\Nfor a full month now!
0.5;Yeah, right! Like he'd\Nbe that easy to find!
0.5;You know, Hirota-san's daughter?\NThe one who came looking for him?
0.5;That's it! I accidentally\Nput the transmitter on her!
0.5;That's weird, too! Masami-san's father\Ncame here from Yamagata!
0.5;Could he be the large man\Nthe inspector was talking about?
0.5;So I wondered if there\Nwas any connection...
0.5;Her hairstyle and overall\Nappearance were different,
0.5;but her build and the number\Nof suitcases she had weren't!
0.5;You intended to kill everyone\Nfrom the start, didn't you?!
0.5;We can't have that, now. As long as\Nyou're alive, my plan is in jeopardy.
0.5;The boss behind\Nthe billion yen robbery!
0.5;she cut herself with a knife and\Npretended she was attacked.
0.5;The cut on Sumika-san's back was a\Nsingle clean horizontal cut, right?
0.5;They're all things that\Nremind you of the Red Woman.
0.5;Normally you'd expect the\Nknife to have rusted more.
0.5;Didn't you say it was impossible for\Neither of them to commit the crime?
0.5;On its way back, it strikes the column,\Ncreating a regular knocking sound.
0.5;When Satoko's body was\Ndiscovered in the swamp,
0.5;Once you make a mistake, you\Nmust immediately make amends.
0.5;All of Japan understands\Nhow you feel, DoDonPa-san.
0.5;"G11 is the Ginza Line's\NNihonbashi, so it's ""hi."""
0.5;However, the code included\Nmysteries I couldn't decipher,
0.5;No one's stupid enough to\Nhit on a girl before a deal.
0.5;Normally you'd expect him to come wearing\Nsomething plain and inconspicuous.
0.5;they would stand out in the\Nmemories of passers-by.
0.5;He said he was in his university's\Npharmaceutical department,
