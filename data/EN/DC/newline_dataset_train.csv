0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 996 ""The \NSkilled Hawk Hides His Crimes"""
0.5;You'll stress out the hawk \Nif you point or wave at him!
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!
0.5;A traditional-style home \Ncafé holds a falconry event.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;You're lucky. You have the whole \Nplace to yourselves today.
0.5;It's quiet today, but this place \Nwas thriving until recently.
0.5;He quit his office job to open \Na traditional-style home café,
0.5;and is currently holding an event \Nto revitalize his mountain village.
0.5;Serene and beautiful mountain villages have \Nthe mysterious ability to soothe people's hearts.
0.5;I began this event because I wanted \Nmore people to learn about that.
0.5;produce memories a little \Ndifferent from one's everyday life.
0.5;I'm sorry. I forgot to get \Nyour signature in one spot.
0.5;These animals are the physical \Nrepresentation of the experience
0.5;and turn it while waiting \Nfor the pressure to rise.
0.5;I used to go into the \Ncity to sell puffed rice.
0.5;The other farmers who grew \Nrice quit farming, too.
0.5;So I'm grateful to Genichi-san for allowing \Nme to make puffed rice at this café.
0.5;we close the lid so the puffed \Nrice doesn't go flying.
0.5;You look like a dove that's \Nbeen shot by a pea shooter.
0.5;Finally, we coat the rice with \Nsugar water and mix well.
0.5;Among them, raptors are my \Nfavorite, especially hawks.
0.5;Things are quiet now, but lots \Nof people used to come before.
0.5;I'm hoping to liven up this place \Nwith this guy like we used to.
0.5;So if you could promote \Ntoday's event at school,
0.5;The main event of our café's \NOkuho Mountain Village Festival.
0.5;There's a lure with rabbit fur and meat \Nhanging in a clearing on that mountain.
0.5;The victim Takehara Genichi-san was \Ninside the thicket with a shotgun.
0.5;However, the shell unfortunately \Nstruck Genichi-san himself.
0.5;You said just pointing at a hawk \Nwith your finger is a bad idea.
0.5;Pardon me. Did you find anything \Naround here that shines?
0.5;Perhaps it was the sunlight \Nreflecting off his shotgun.
0.5;But, Mori-kun, unlike other guns, \Nshotguns have long barrels.
0.5;Is it possible for someone to accidentally \Nshoot themselves with one?
0.5;He probably held the gun \Nlike this, then this,
0.5;She seems okay, but there's no \Ntelling how she really feels.
0.5;I know Genichi-san won't come back \Nno matter how much I apologize.
0.5;This is probably the last \Nyear we'll hold this event.
0.5;My husband won't be able to \Nrest in peace if we stop now.
0.5;like getting caught in crow \Nguards or fishing line.
0.5;A device was used to disguise \Nhis death as an accident.
0.5;There was fishing line strung \Nup where the husband died.
0.5;The hawk flew off course because \Nits feet got caught on it.
0.5;But, Mori-san, we didn't find \Nany fishing line at the scene.
0.5;It was at the bottom of a nearby \Nravine, wrapped around a wooden drum.
0.5;The culprit must've wrapped the \Nfishing line around the drum
0.5;and dropped it down the ravine so it \Nwouldn't remain at the crime scene.
0.5;The thread was tied to a \Nshotgun set up in the thicket.
0.5;The thread was drawn in \Nfront of the hawk's target.
0.5;That shell pierced the fastener on the \Ndevice supporting Genichi-san's body.
0.5;The shotgun was also dragged down by the \Nfishing line and left at the crime scene.
0.5;But Mori-san, why did the \Nculprit set up that device?
0.5;The events of this festival \Noccur at fixed times.
0.5;Ishima-san, who is in charge of the puffed \Nrice demonstration, was exactly on schedule.
0.5;The culprit knew this and killed the husband \Nas the puffed rice machine made a loud noise.
0.5;At that time, I thought I heard a gunshot \Nin what I believed to be an echo.
0.5;But there was no echo when I shouted to \Nthe person I thought was the husband.
0.5;And the person absent at \Nthat time was you, ma'am.
0.5;if you shot him during the puffed \Nrice demonstration, didn't you?
0.5;There's was a bloodstain on the \Nsame spot on your husband's body.
0.5;The blood was also on your \Nhusband's hunting jacket.
0.5;It probably stained the \Nsame spot when you wore it.
0.5;I thought if I killed that man using the \Nmountain village's power that he mocked,
0.5;then that poor hawk who \Nwas simply used for profit
0.5;Ma'am, you can tell us \Nabout it at the station.
0.5;Exterminating crows is an \Nimportant job falconers perform.
0.5;Hawks don't attack people, \Nbut crows do, so be careful.
0.5;Surely you didn't just want to show \Nus your improved talent for disguises.
0.5;This morning I received a message \Nfrom Kir, Mizunashi Rena.
0.5;No. It's the name of a liquor \Nyou're very familiar with.
0.5;When I was in the Organization, \NI heard the name a couple of times.
0.5;Since she sent only one word, \Nit was probably an urgent message.
0.5;In any case, tell James \Nsomeone big is on the move.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;By the way, did you see \Nyesterday's Tokyo Derby?
0.5;That's right! It's no wonder \Nhe's their star player!
0.5;I told you before. I don't \Nknow much about liquor.
0.5;To get information on Rum, close adviser \Nto the Black Organization's boss,
0.5;who's infiltrated the Organization, or ask \Nundercover public safety officer Amuro-san...
0.5;At the very least, that's what \NI heard while I was there.
0.5;While I was in the organization, \NI heard all kinds of descriptions.
0.5;Some people claimed they \Nwere all his doubles.
0.5;The Organization uses types of liquor \Nfor all its code names, right?
0.5;I was just wondering if there \Nwas someone named Rum...
0.5;I bet you're thirsty after \Nplaying soccer in the park.
0.5;So I was looking to see if the shop \Nover there was selling ramune.
0.5;Maybe someone's about to \Nfall from a high place.
0.5;Three men are going to \Nvisit the lady's apartment.
0.5;she's probably been killed, \Nso I should call the police.
0.5;It's been about thirty minutes \Nsince the third man left.
0.5;Do you remember what the \Nthree men looked like?
0.5;The descriptions of his appearance were \Nvaried, but the trait was always the same.
0.5;Yeah. She'd talk to me when I \Nwas playing alone in the park.
0.5;"Yeah. While I was on a field trip, \Nthey got involved in a ""robin murder."""
0.5;I'm staying with my uncle, \Nbut he's too busy to play with me.
0.5;So after seeing how lonely you were, \Nthe woman decided to play with you.
0.5;Yeah. I asked to come to her house to \Nplay before, but she wouldn't let me.
0.5;But today she made an \Nexception and invited me.
0.5;She told me all about the \Nstory she was going to write.
0.5;She told me if she didn't come out, I should \Nlet the police handle it and stay outside!
0.5;If this were really a suicide, there would \Nbe a stool or something by her feet.
0.5;Since that's missing, it means someone \Nkilled her and made this look like a suicide.
0.5;It was probably one of the \Nthree men this kid saw.
0.5;If it's been about thirty minutes since \Nthe third man left, we're too late.
0.5;Even though he was panicked \Nenough to forget the stool,
0.5;there are no signs he \Nleft the room in a hurry.
0.5;And I don't see the Yoshikawa lines left \Nbehind when a strangulation victim struggles.
0.5;But who would plan that \Nmuch and forget the stool?
0.5;All that's inside is the \Nbank's ATM usage details.
0.5;According to this, she withdrew \N500,000 yen three hours ago,
0.5;So you were watching this apartment \Nat the woman's request,
0.5;and after three men came and left, \Nyou came here to find her like this?
0.5;The deceased is scriptwriter\NKomai Yasue-san.
0.5;If this is murder, we'll have to \Nfind people among her associates
0.5;who may have resented her and call \Nthem in for a lineup with this kid.
0.5;We have the names of the three people \Nthe victim was meeting here today.
0.5;They're in the scheduling software \Ninstalled on the computer on the desk.
0.5;This afternoon she met Sakaba Ronbei,\NHabanaka Kuramichi, and Shibakaru Denji.
0.5;Yes. It's written on the notebook in the \Ndrawer and calendar, so it's probably correct.
0.5;Also, we can't find the 500,000 yen the \Nvictim withdrew from the bank today anywhere.
0.5;So they killed her for the money, \Nmade it look like a suicide, and ran.
0.5;The three men who came to \Nthe woman's room are here!
0.5;Could you point them out while keeping \Nyour face hidden behind the railing?
0.5;I just came to check out the \Nincident in the neighborhood.
0.5;The witness also said the victim \NKomai Yasue-san asked him
0.5;to watch the apartment because one of the \Nthree men coming to visit may kill her.
0.5;We became drinking buddies after \Na chance meeting at a bar.
0.5;She said she was worried so I came to talk, \Nbut I had no idea it had driven her to suicide...
0.5;Yes, so I have no idea what \Nshe was concerned about.
0.5;We're old friends, so I \Nlent her a bunch of money.
0.5;I hired Komai-san to write a script for \Nthis fall's special mystery program.
0.5;She said the script was ready, \Nso I came to pick it up.
0.5;It was just inside the door, \Nso I took it and gave it to my AD.
0.5;but the script was due, so I didn't \Nhave time to think about it.
0.5;Wouldn't you normally call \Nthe police if you saw that?
0.5;Surely you didn't have a reason \Nyou couldn't call the police.
0.5;They were the first ones \Nto discover the body.
0.5;Though it seems you're the \Nactual first discoverers.
0.5;In any case, we'd like to question you \Nseparately, so come inside one at a time.
0.5;The money was supposed \Nto be deposited by 2 PM,
0.5;but when I checked the \NATM, there was no money.
0.5;I got scared when I saw her dead\Nbody, so I rushed back to the ATM.
0.5;I had to pay off my card today, so I \Nwas forced to use the money I had.
0.5;If you compare the time between \Nwhen I left and came back
0.5;with how long it takes to get \Nfrom here to the bank and back,
0.5;That's not quite an alibi, but \Nit will help the investigation.
0.5;You really don't remember the \Norder in which they came?
0.5;He really was on the ATM's \Nsecurity camera footage?
0.5;But, sir, he was away from \Nthe ATM for forty minutes.
0.5;It takes less than twenty minutes \Nto get there and back.
0.5;There's definitely 500,000 \Nyen in there somewhere.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Three \NFirst Discoverers, Part Two!"""
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut cases are even more so!
0.5;Today's title is a bit unusual!\NCan you solve the mystery in Part 1?!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;Is there really\Nan empty lot nearby
0.5;C'mon, you guys. Play soccer\Nonce in a while, will ya?
0.5;This is a construction site\Nfor an apartment building!
0.5;That's right! Except they stopped\Nconstruction half a month ago!
0.5;Then we can\Nplay baseball in here?!
0.5;We can't get in\Nhere because it's locked,
0.5;but I found another\Nway in yesterday!
0.5;See? There's paint\Nfrom a car on the fence.
0.5;A car must've hit\Nit and made this hole.
0.5;Alright! This manhole\Nwill be the home plate!
0.5;Still, this is clearly\Nbreaking and entering...
0.5;Oh, crap! He's watching\Nwith binoculars!
0.5;Hey, could it have\Ngone over that fence, too?
0.5;Then let's ask the person\Nwho lives there to let us get it.
0.5;That seems to be\Na back entrance, so...
0.5;But what if a really\Nstubborn man lives here?
0.5;but someone was watching from\Nthe upstairs window with binoculars.
0.5;Meaning someone is home, right?!\NLet's give it a shot!
0.5;Geez. You got a big body,\Nbut no guts at all.
0.5;Excuse me! Our ball landed\Nin your yard! Could we get it?
0.5;W-Wait, hold on!\NWithout that ball, we can't--
0.5;That's what you get\Nfor playing baseball there!
0.5;If I catch you in there again,\NI'm contacting your school!
0.5;He wasn't a stubborn man.\NHe was a stubborn old man.
0.5;Like he said, we're the ones at\Nfault for going where we shouldn't.
0.5;Did you come to the\NMori Detective Agency?
0.5;My name is Koda. My younger\Nsister went missing a month ago.
0.5;I'm sorry, but could you guys\Nplay outside a little while longer?
0.5;So, you want me\Nto find a missing person?
0.5;No. My sister was murdered!\NBy a man named Watanuki Yoshikazu!
0.5;The Watanuki-san who lives\Nnext to the construction site?
0.5;He wouldn't let us get the\Nball Genta-kun hit into his yard!
0.5;H-Hold on! Please explain\Neverything from the start.
0.5;But I can't\Nremember where from...
0.5;Oh, I know Saku! It\Nhas the Cosmos Road, right?
0.5;Yes. My sister loved\Ncosmos flowers, too.
0.5;My sister moved here six years\Nago to work for Toto Securities.
0.5;Two years ago, she became\Nhead of the Beika branch office.
0.5;But on the night of the 8th of\Nlast month, she left to go see a client
0.5;And this client was\NWatanuki Yoshikazu-san?
0.5;I came to town two\Nnights after, on a Sunday,
0.5;and learned about this\Nat her office the following day.
0.5;Around what time\Ndid she leave the office?
0.5;She supposedly said she was\Ngoing to stop by Watanuki's house
0.5;Why would she visit\Na client at such an hour?
0.5;the stock Watanuki had\Nbought had plummeted in value,
0.5;and he was pressuring her into\Ncompensating him for his losses.
0.5;"One of those so-called\N""compensation payments,"" huh?"
0.5;Yes. The branch manager and\NI went on the afternoon of the 11th.
0.5;He says my sister never\Nshowed up the night of the 8th!
0.5;But that's a lie! She went to his\Nhouse that night, but refused to pay!
0.5;Watanuki snapped, killed her,\Nand buried her in his yard!
0.5;Say, why do you think\Nshe was buried in the yard?
0.5;First, Watanuki doesn't\Nhave a driver's license.
0.5;He couldn't take the\Nbody far away without a car.
0.5;Second, late that night,\Nat about 2:00 am,
0.5;a businessman in the next\Nhouse overheard a shovel digging.
0.5;A man named Mochida-san\Nwho lives nearby.
0.5;He says that construction\Nwas being done on the main street
0.5;that night between\Nmidnight and 3:00 am.
0.5;I see. So, did you\Ntell the police about this?
0.5;But Mochida-san had\Nbeen very drunk that night,
0.5;so the police said his\Ntestimony wasn't credible.
0.5;In the end, they only\Nquestioned Watanuki on ceremony.
0.5;He lives alone, and he's almost\Nnever left his house since that night.
0.5;But every Saturday\Nmorning at around 10:00,
0.5;he leaves for Beika Central Hospital\Nand is gone for two hours.
0.5;Tomorrow is Saturday, so I'd like\Nyou to come with me to his house
0.5;and deduce where\Nhe buried my sister's body!
0.5;In other words, you want me\Nto sneak into his yard with you?
0.5;It's illegal to enter others'\Nyards without permission.
0.5;Besides, skilled as I am, it'd be\Nimpossible to tell, in such a short time,
0.5;where a body was\Nburied over a month ago.
0.5;That person looks\Njust like a Mole Alien!
0.5;Right?! Mole Aliens take on\Nfriends' forms to trick Masked Yaiba!
0.5;Oh! So that's why he\Nwanted to dig up the yard!
0.5;What am I supposed to do?\NHe told me to forget about it.
0.5;Besides, he's certain this Watanuki\Nkilled his sister and buried her,
0.5;Even the shovel sound could've\Ncome from the street construction.
0.5;Well, I guess\NI can give it a quick check.
0.5;Yeah, there is some\Ntruth to what the old guy says.
0.5;First, we need to think of\Na way to get inside somehow.
0.5;Yes, there's no way to tell\Nwhere she's buried just by looking.
0.5;Of course not! We don't even\Nknow if she really is buried here!
0.5;Then let's start digging up\Nthe place! I'll go find a shovel!
0.5;Yes, that Koda fellow\Ngave us a bit of trouble, too.
0.5;Watanuki-san lost about 1.5\Nmillion yen in the stock market.
0.5;That's a lot of money, but certainly\Nnot enough to kill someone over.
0.5;On top of that, he's certain\NWatanuki-san is responsible
0.5;and has been following\Nhim around for a month now.
0.5;The way we see it, Watanuki-san\Nseems more like the victim here.
0.5;We're sorry! We just really\Nwanted our ball, so we snuck in...
0.5;It's all right. I was a bit on edge before.\NI'm sorry I shouted at you.
0.5;if you promise never to go to\Nthose apartments to play again.
0.5;You have a checkup scheduled\Nfor tomorrow, so be sure to come.
0.5;What nonsense! I know that!\NI don't need to be told!
0.5;He was acting so nice at first,\Nbut suddenly grew angry.
0.5;He's one moody\Nold man, that's for sure.
0.5;while Watanuki-san\Nis at the hospital.
0.5;But, is there really\Na body buried in this yard?
0.5;Even if there is, it'd be impossible\Nto tell where it is in just two hours.
0.5;What exactly does\NKoda-san plan to do?!
0.5;Even after I told\Nthem not to come...
0.5;I thought I'd help the\NMole Alien dig up the body!
0.5;Say, what do you\Nplan to do, Conan-kun?
0.5;Whatever the reason, sneaking\Nonto others' property isn't right.
0.5;If he decides to come back,\Ncall us on your Detective League badge!
0.5;Does this mean you weren't\Nhere when it happened?
0.5;No, I just happened\Nto be passing by right now.
0.5;I thought for sure you were at the scene\N of the crime, yet again--
0.5;The security camera got a\Nlook at the robber's face!
0.5;Whatever the case,\NKoda ran off with a dozen or so jewels!
0.5;The robber's motorcycle\Nwas found near Beika Station!
0.5;The plate number matches\Nwith the witness' testimony perfectly.
0.5;No question about it! He got on\Nthe Loop Line from Beika Station!
0.5;Everyone else, continue\Nto scour the vicinity!
0.5;Is Ayumi right? Has Koda-san\Nfooled us just like the Mole Aliens?
0.5;Was the whole story\Nabout his sister a fabrication?!
0.5;And, even if he had a reason,\Nwhy would someone so well-prepared
0.5;commit the crime without sunglasses\Nor a mask to conceal himself
0.5;and ditch his getaway\Nvehicle for everyone to see?
0.5;The fact it's stuck here means\Nsomeone opened this not so long ago!
0.5;Genta-kun! The old\Nman is taking a taxi back!
0.5;Hey! Mister! Watanuki-san\Nis gonna be back soon!
0.5;and various events were \Nmet with great enthusiasm.
0.5;We have all of you who support \Nus to thank for that.
0.5;I'd only been looking up at her from a low \Nangle recently, so I was starting to forget,
0.5;Didn't we meet on the \Nbeach when we were kids?
0.5;Three of the Teitan High School popularity \Ncontest's top ten girls are in our group.
0.5;Since you confessed your feelings to Mori in \NLondon, I'll pass on her out of respect for you.
0.5;Sonoko's got a really strong boyfriend, \Nand Sera's a Jeet Kune Do...
0.5;I'm surprised you were able \Nto come on the school trip.
0.5;but if you don't mind, the \Nmedicine to restore my body...
0.5;Conan jumped into the sea when the \Nstrap nearly fell into the water.
0.5;It ended up belonging \Nto someone else, though.
0.5;And he kept looking even \Nthough his clothes were wet.
0.5;Come to think of it, you kids \Nseem a little dirty, too.
0.5;I guess I'll have to give \Nup on the school trip.
0.5;I wouldn't want people to know \NKudo Shinichi is still alive.
0.5;Sera-chan, don't lean over \Nso far. It's dangerous.
0.5;Apparently someone jumped to their \Ndeath from here the other day.
0.5;Have you responded\Nto Shinichi-kun's confession?
0.5;Imagine you're leaping \Noff the Kiyomizu butai.
0.5;What's going on? Ran-kun, \Nare you going to jump off?
0.5;Excuse me, are you the \Nactress Kurachi Keiko-san?
0.5;Are you Kudo Shinichi-kun, \Nthe high school detective?
0.5;Some college classmates and I came \Nto pay our respects to an old friend.
0.5;I say classmates, but they're \Nall celebrities, too.
0.5;I know. Since we're staying in the same \Nhotel, could you come to my room tonight?
0.5;She's that long-haired \Ngirl over there, right?
0.5;The general staying at Fushimi \NCastle at this time...
0.5;It figures a high school girl \Ndetective would say that.
0.5;Besides, it was painted on the ceiling to \Nmemorialize the men who died in battle.
0.5;Besides, I heard that movie is a \Nremake of one they made in college.
0.5;If my name appeared alongside \Ntheirs on the movie poster,
0.5;I thought it'd be a good \Nopportunity to promote you.
0.5;When I told them I was meeting \Nyou, they insisted on coming.
0.5;She's a detective, too.\NA high school girl detective.
0.5;I tripped during filming \Nand got a bump on my head.
0.5;Were you filming for your movie \Nthat comes out this weekend?
0.5;The highlight of this historical \Nfantasy film is its star, me.
0.5;I believe the highlight of \Nthe film is me, the director.
0.5;I thought the selling point \Nof the film was my music.
0.5;People have always said a \Nmovie is made by its director.
0.5;The envelope the cipher came in also \Ncontained a dried paper plant leaf.
0.5;Do you know what these four black \Nsquares at the top of the cipher mean?
0.5;That's the mark of Dekuri, the \Nguy who came up with that cipher.
0.5;The other day, he jumped to his \Ndeath from the Kiyomizu butai.
0.5;I thought that cipher was \Na message he left to me
0.5;We're going to get dinner \Nin the hotel lounge.
0.5;If you want to know more, \Nwhy don't you come with us?
0.5;Come to think of it, I wonder what the \Npaper plant leaf in the envelope was about.
0.5;We were supposed to meet at this room \Nin ten minutes before heading down.
0.5;He wouldn't answer the door no matter \Nhow many times we rang the bell,
0.5;Yeah, and the footprints on the \Nceiling lead to the window.
0.5;Most likely the culprit wanted it to seem like \Nhe lifted the victim to the ceiling to stab him,
0.5;and vanished from the window \Nof this 15th floor room,
0.5;and magic powers capable of \Nmanipulating human bodies
0.5;Are you saying Nishiki-kun \Nwas killed by a tengu?
0.5;They only exist within movies like the \None we were filming until recently.
0.5;Are you saying Nishiki was \Nkilled by a fictional monster?
0.5;Either way, it seems like the culprit wanted \Nit to look like the work of a tengu.
0.5;There's a paper plant leaf in the victim's \Njacket, which tengu often carry.
0.5;Maybe the similar cipher \NNishiki-san received last week
0.5;Is it possible this Dekuri person \Nwho came up with the code hated you?
0.5;Either way, this is probably \Nthe work of someone unhappy
0.5;"with your movie ""The Fighting Tengu"" \Nthat comes out this weekend."
0.5;The movie's script is scattered \Nall over the floor.
0.5;what are these smooth pieces of \Npaper stuck all over the script?
0.5;Nishiki had been using that \Ntype of label recently
0.5;since they were easy to \Nstick on and take off.
0.5;Nishiki brought the script to the \Nhotel so he could make adjustments.
0.5;He was so excited to finish \Nit before the movie opened...
0.5;You said you planned to meet at this room \Nin ten minutes before going to dinner.
0.5;then the culprit killed Nishiki-san \Nand sprayed the ceiling
0.5;Yeah. That blood wasn't there \Nwhen we came here earlier.
0.5;The bellhop who unlocked the \Ndoor called the police for us.
0.5;He just called to say a Kyoto Police inspector \Nnamed Ayanokoji would be coming.
0.5;I'll leave Sera with you.\NIf you need anything, talk to her.
0.5;I should be fine after a good \Nnight's sleep. Don't worry.
0.5;Seriously? We were looking \Nforward to hearing about it.
0.5;We mixed up the cards because we \Nthought a teacher came to check on us.
0.5;Then you guys can play the \Nrest of the round yourselves.
0.5;He's just excited because he \Nfinally got to see his wife again.
0.5;Just so you know, Kudo,\Nyou really owe me for this.
0.5;When in Rome, do as the \NRomans do, you know?
0.5;You guys had better learn to \Nspeak in a Kansai accent, too.
0.5;I'd better keep my voice changer \Non me starting tomorrow.
0.5;Don't take the next dose immediately \Nwhen the medicine wears off.
0.5;Don't draw attention to yourself \Nwhen you're Kudo Shinichi.
0.5;But following the first three is my condition \Nfor giving you the APTX 4869 antidote.
0.5;The high school detective Kudo \NShinichi-kun mentioned me?
0.5;Yeah. He said not to worry \Nsince you're a smart inspector.
0.5;Should a police officer be \Nbringing a pet to a crime scene?
0.5;Not only was he stabbed in the heart, \Nbut he has two bumps on his head.
0.5;It will take some time to \Nexamine the crime scene.
0.5;After all, the victim and the \Nsuspects are all celebrities.
0.5;I'm sure there will be quite \Nthe commotion tomorrow morning.
0.5;Will I make it until the \Nend of the school trip?
0.5;Yes. He was shouting loudly enough that I \Ncould hear him from the neighboring room.
0.5;"Shouting, ""Help me! \NHe's going to kill me!"""
0.5;the Osaka Police chief's \Nson Hattori Heiji-kun.
0.5;Agata-san was heard shouting something \Nrather strange inside his room.
0.5;He's probably having nightmares after seeing \Nlast night's crime scene and moaning in his sleep.
0.5;Yeah, like some kind of \Nspecial effects movie.
0.5;When Agata-san threw his ashtray at \Nit, it went up in flames and vanished.
0.5;According to him,\Nafter Nishiki-san was killed,
0.5;he sensed something strange \Nand looked up at the ceiling.
0.5;Keiko-san heard him from \Nthe neighboring room.
0.5;We arrived after she contacted \Nus and saw the tengu, too.
0.5;it's possible someone took the drunk \NAgata-san to his room and set something up.
0.5;Kurachi Keiko-san said she got \Nbumps on her head during filming.
0.5;She asked the director \Nto re-shoot the final scene
0.5;When I saw her earlier, her forehead \Nwas still a little swollen,
0.5;She said looking back, it's \Npossible someone pushed her.
0.5;When she tripped, she laughed about how she \Nlooked like the Kobutori Jisan from the folktale.
0.5;What? I thought the Kobutori \NJisan's bumps were on his cheeks.
0.5;Each region seems to have its \Nown version of the story.
0.5;Anyway, was the blood on the ceiling at \NNishiki-san's murder scene really his blood?
0.5;The police examined it and determined \Nthat only the center of the blood spray,
0.5;in other words, the bit that dripped on \Nyour shoulder, was Nishiki-san's blood,
0.5;and the rest was paint sprayed \Nonto the ceiling beforehand.
0.5;Also, they didn't find the blade used \Nto stab Nishiki-san at the crime scene.
0.5;I thought it'd be buried under \Nthe pages scattered on the floor.
0.5;People are saying you and \NI French kissed in London!
0.5;Nakamichi-kun's telling everyone \Nin a weird Kansai accent.
0.5;"He says, ""Those two \Nkids already smooched."""
0.5;Apparently Shinichi-kun told him to \Ndo as the Romans do when in Rome.
0.5;The food's delicious. \NThese sausages are the best.
0.5;Normally wouldn't you push your sleeves \Nup like this if they were in the way?
0.5;It's like a small child \Nwas wearing that jacket.
0.5;Y-You idiot, that's obviously \Nnot what happened.
0.5;A police officer of the Kyoto \Nmagistrate's office named Kuranosuke
0.5;asks the magistrate if there's anything \Nunusual he can offer the general.
0.5;his wife Mana presents her husband with a \Ngolden paper plant leaf and says to him...
0.5;I found this paper plant leaf while \Nforaging for vegetables in the mountains.
0.5;I always prayed to it with clasped \Nhands, but I have brought it for you.
0.5;But after that day, strange monsters \Nbegan appearing every night
0.5;That paper plant leaf was a magic seal a \Ntengu used long ago to imprison the monsters.
0.5;While this is happening, the tengu \Nappears to Kuranosuke in his dreams.
0.5;They are looking for her \Nso that they may kill her.
0.5;If you hide the golden paper \Nplant leaf in your wife's bosom
0.5;Then take the paper plant leaf \Nand jump from the Kiyomizu butai.
0.5;Kuranosuke leaps from the Kiyomizu \Nbutai and becomes a golden tengu.
0.5;He saves Mana from the monsters just \Nbefore they're about to eat her,
0.5;But now that Kuranosuke is a tengu, \NMana can't see him anymore.
0.5;As Mana is crying over the sudden \Ndisappearance of her husband,
0.5;take a tengu's flower to the \NKiyomizu butai at sunset
0.5;Mana picks a speedwell and goes to \Nthe Kiyomizu butai as she was told.
0.5;Kuranosuke appears before her as a tengu \Nand explains to Mana what happened.
0.5;But why did you tell me \Nto come in the evening?
0.5;If I'd come when the sun were higher, \Nwe could've spent more time together.
0.5;I thought if we were surrounded by \Nred, the color would hide it a little.
0.5;Answering her question, they \Nexchange a farewell kiss,
0.5;and Kuranosuke disappears into \Nthe approaching darkness.
0.5;Actually, this movie is a \Nremake of a graduation project
0.5;They became famous because \Nof that graduation project,
0.5;so it's hard to imagine one \Nof them was unhappy with it.
0.5;Maybe that was a speedwell \Nlike the one in the story.
0.5;"I think she also said, ""You just wait, \NDekuri-kun. It won't be long now."""
0.5;There wasn't anyone like \Nthat on the staff list.
0.5;Mana and Kuranosuke kissed \Nat the Kiyomizu butai...
0.5;This afternoon you'll be free to go \Nwhere you want with your groups.
0.5;Make sure you follow the course \Nyou planned with your group
0.5;If you use a selfie stick at the hotel baths, \Nyou can look into the women's baths.
0.5;Not only have you kissed her, \Nbut you've also bathed together?
0.5;Your teachers might cancel the trip \Nand take you guys back to Tokyo.
0.5;The teachers seem to be \Navoiding mentioning the case,
0.5;are pretty far away from the \Nroom Nishiki-san died in.
0.5;Those four want to tell us about that \NDekuri guy who came up with the cipher.
0.5;It's hard for them to talk \Nhere with the media around,
0.5;so they want to secretly meet for lunch at \Na restaurant where they have a reservation.
0.5;You'll want to speak with \Nthem in person, right?
0.5;How about a place called \NIsogiyama in Ponto City?
0.5;They say they're to deter thieves \Nor mark the edges of the street,
0.5;but they're apparently for \Ndeterring dogs from urinating.
0.5;Yeah. We met last time I \Ncame to Kyoto with my dad.
0.5;Thank you for coming all \Nthe way from the provinces.
0.5;Oh, right. Momiji-san, you attend \NKyoto Senshin High School, right?
0.5;People are saying tengu have \Nappeared on Kiyamachi Way.
0.5;But, Inspector, it's not \Njust a couple of tengu.
0.5;100 thousand yen up front just for wearing a \Ntengu mask and running around Kiyamachi Way.
0.5;If you don't get caught for thirty minutes, \Nthey said they'd pay a million.
0.5;Hattori, is it just those four \Nin the restaurant right now?
0.5;He's upside down with two \Nbumps on his head again.
0.5;They must've taken the \Ntime to make these marks
0.5;The blood spray and footprints \Non the inuyarai...
0.5;I don't have time to think \Nabout that right now.
0.5;"The next special episode of Conan is \N""The Scarlet School Trip, Red Love Arc!"""
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut the world is even more so!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;"I bet it's just another of those\N""Seven Mysteries"" every school has."
0.5;Like pianos that play on their own,\Nor stairs that increase in number.
0.5;She was fond of a\Nlarge painting in the art room,
0.5;All eight plaster figures in\Nthe art room were glaring at her!
0.5;Doesn't there seem to be fewer\Nstudents at this school lately?!
0.5;Who knows, maybe they've all\Nbeen cursed by the plaster figures!
0.5;The story I heard is much\Ncrazier than those plaster figures!
0.5;You know that gross\Ndoll in the nurse's office?
0.5;It was running super-fast\Nthrough the hallway four nights ago!
0.5;Anyways, we gotta do a\NJunior Detective League investigation
0.5;There's nothing we can do.\NShe got married and quit her job.
0.5;I couldn't help it.\NI was worried about the fishies.
0.5;Yeah. I forgot to feed them that day,\Nso I came to check on them.
0.5;And then I saw someone in\Nthis classroom, in the pitch dark!
0.5;They were wandering around\Ncreepy-like, with a big, white mask on!
0.5;That's just it... He hasn't come\Nto school yesterday or today!
0.5;Kobayashi-sensei and the other\Nteachers said they haven't seen him,
0.5;and nobody answered the\Ndoorbell when I went to his house!
0.5;He would've contacted\Nthe school if that were the case.
0.5;It's because of what I asked him\Nthat that strange person killed him!
0.5;Hey, you! What's all\Nthe ruckus?! Get cleaning!
0.5;And you'll all take Open House\Nnotices to your sick friends afterward!
0.5;Oh, Kobayashi-sensei!\NWhy the pale face?
0.5;after being transferred here must be tough,\Nbut you should be more easygoing.
0.5;Say, Ohata-sensei.\NCan I ask you something?
0.5;Do you know what's happened\Nto the assistant principal?
0.5;He's been absent for\Ntwo days without notice,
0.5;but I'm sure he'll\Nshow up sooner or later!
0.5;Darn it! They're all a\Nbunch of creepy big-shots!
0.5;Now, now! Do not\Nkick the school building so!
0.5;I've shared many hard times with it.\NIt may as well be my double.
0.5;Secrets will always get out.\NHe was truly unlucky.
0.5;We, the Detective League,\Nwill now break into the school...
0.5;...to solve the many mysteries\Nthat have happened here!
0.5;Let's keep this a secret.\NIf the teachers found out...
0.5;Especially if you're\Nwearing muddy shoes.
0.5;We'll be spotted\Nif we turn the lights on!
0.5;There's a mark where\Nthe desk and figure meet...
0.5;It looks like Mitsuhiko's\Nstory wasn't just a rumor.
0.5;What's that? There's something\Nstuck to the figure's forehead...
0.5;Then should we check\Nout the nurse's office next?
0.5;How odd.\NI don't see it anywhere.
0.5;Don't tell me it's running through\Nthe hallway, like the rumors say!
0.5;But I dropped my\Nhandkerchief somewhere...
0.5;A doll! I think\Nit came from this box!
0.5;Another class must've\Nused them for a puppet play!
0.5;But it's strange...\NWhy is this out here?
0.5;H-Hey! Don't tell me\Nsomeone's out to get me?!
0.5;Yes! It was probably the name of\Nthe student using it in the play!
0.5;You're not suggesting this is\Nconnected to the drop in students lately?
0.5;D-Does that\Nmean I'm the next to go?!
0.5;It's not like that!\NWe're just being misled by the rumors!
0.5;After all, the plaster\Nfigures were in the art room...
0.5;...and the anatomy\Nmodel is in the nurse's office!
0.5;Th-The anatomy model\Nis in front of the nurse's office!
0.5;You probably just\Nsaw something else!
0.5;No. Look at the base of\Nthis anatomy model.
0.5;In other words, this model moved\Nafter we left the nurse's office.
0.5;Don't be stupid.\NSomeone obviously moved it.
0.5;If that were the case, they wouldn't\Nhave put it back where it was!
0.5;is the person sneaking around school,\Ndoing odd things at this hour!
0.5;Someone was looking this\Nway from the opposite window!
0.5;I saw the anatomy model from\Nthe window facing the nurse's office!
0.5;If the intruder heard my scream,\Nquickly put the anatomy model back,
0.5;and then watched\Nthrough this window,
0.5;we would've bumped into\Nthem on our way to the nurse's office!
0.5;It's proof that someone was\Npressed against the window, looking out!
0.5;No, he probably just\Ndrank himself to sleep again.
0.5;The guy's still at it,\Nafter all these years.
0.5;I can't really tell them I'm actually\Na graduate of this grade school...
0.5;But now what? Nothing's happened,\Nso I can't call the police.
0.5;Oh, Conan! Where are you?\NRan was worried sick!
0.5;Teitan Elementary School!\NCould you come here?
0.5;Don't be stupid! I already\Ngraduated from elementary school!
0.5;No, I want you and Ran-neechan\Nto come right away!
0.5;Oh, well. I guess I'll look around the\Nschool more until they come.
0.5;It follows the taped-up\Npaper and flows down the handrail!
0.5;Dry ice for science\Nexperiments, with water added.
0.5;Meaning the intruder\Nis trying to scare us away?
0.5;There's no point.\NThey'll just get away.
0.5;What's taking the old\Nguy so long? What's he doing?
0.5;There are ten! What are\Nthey doing in that pitch-dark room?!
0.5;Isn't it obvious?\NTo catch the intruder!
0.5;There are plaster figures\Nagainst the wall...
0.5;and the figures and anatomy model\Nas parents to practice every night
0.5;while wearing a mask to\Nkeep from being heard outside.
0.5;Isn't that right, Class 1-B homeroom\Nteacher hiding under the desk...
0.5;Then the stories about the moving\Nfigures and anatomy model...
0.5;Were because she\Ncarried them here every night!
0.5;The running anatomy model\Nwas actually her carrying it hurriedly.
0.5;But you should really focus\Non being nicer to us instead of this.
0.5;Yes! You should fix\Nyour child-hating attitude first!
0.5;I actually like you\Nstudents all so much.
0.5;I adore my students so much that\NI couldn't get mad at my last school.
0.5;But at my first Open House,\NI got so nervous that it failed horribly.
0.5;When one boy made fun of me,\Nthe one next to him started a fight
0.5;so I made myself mean\Nand treated my students strictly.
0.5;But each time an Open House nears,\Nthose memories come back
0.5;So I would secretly practice\Nlike this every night.
0.5;You seemed a lot like the boy\Nwho started the fight, Kojima-kun,
0.5;But as a result, the students\Nfear me and call me a hag...
0.5;and changes the fish's\Nwater after everyone leaves!
0.5;We were all saying how\Nrare it is for a hag to do that...
0.5;Basically, no matter\Nhow much you falsify yourself,
0.5;Since the truth's out, maybe you\Nshould go back to your real self?
0.5;Though in your case, you might\Nhave to fix your nervousness first.
0.5;But that was mean of you\Nto use smoke and paint to scare us!
0.5;You were the one watching\Nus through the window, right?
0.5;No. This is the first time\NI saw you kids tonight.
0.5;After I heard your scream,\NI put the anatomy model back
0.5;and stayed hidden in\Nthe nurse's office for awhile.
0.5;Then who unlocked\Nthe faculty office door?!
0.5;The faculty office?\NWhat are you talking about?
0.5;There's someone else,\Ninside the faculty office!
0.5;The person who tried to scare\Nus away was the assistant principal.
0.5;He came here to find the\Nhairpiece that he lost two days ago
0.5;when the wind blew\Nit off in the faculty office.
0.5;...In actuality, the principal\Nmight've secretly taken it.
0.5;But you gave the\Nestimated time of death!
0.5;While the old man was \Nwatching the horse races
0.5;we found a dark horse payout \Nticket he didn't recall buying.
0.5;he picked up someone else's \Nticket and put it in his wallet?
0.5;All right, tonight we're having \Nsushi for dinner, sushi!
0.5;So the elated old man dragged \Nus to Beika Irohazushi,
0.5;I'm not the type of guy to \Nsettle down in one place.
0.5;As we finished eating and \Nwere settling our bill,
0.5;a woman ran into the restaurant, claiming her \Npouch had been stolen from her on a full train.
0.5;Based on the timing, apparently someone \Nin the restaurant was the thief.
0.5;My dark horse payout ticket \Nworth a million yen!
0.5;Maybe the ticket you picked \Nup belongs to that woman.
0.5;I was watching the races \Nin my office around then.
0.5;But the TV broadcast of the races \Nended about 50 minutes ago.
0.5;Since you were out buying tickets, \Nyou only saw the last race.
0.5;An little over an hour ago, you \Nwould've been near the ticket booth.
0.5;Maybe the thief was in a \Nrush to redeem the ticket,
0.5;And you picked it up and \Nput it in your wallet.
0.5;Come to think of it, Kogoro-san, didn't \Nyou have a winning dark horse ticket?
0.5;Let's see which of us can \Nfind the thief first.
0.5;B-But there wasn't any \Nblood on anyone's sleeve.
0.5;It's strange that that woman's \Nblood wasn't on anyone's sleeve.
0.5;But why did the thief leave the \Nstolen pouch in the bathroom?
0.5;A professional thief \Nwould've taken the money
0.5;A chef and the old man \Nhave a detective showdown!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""The Tokyo-Style Detective \NShow Next Door, Part Two!"""
0.5;Since the stolen pouch was \Nleft in this bathroom,
0.5;is there some significance \Nspecific to Irohazushi?
0.5;It's that young man's first \Ntime at this restaurant.
0.5;I'll have the nigiri special, \Nsome chawanmushi...
0.5;The man sitting next to him \Nseems to have been here before.
0.5;Also, do you have the limited availability \Nseasonal grilled fish today, too?
0.5;In that case, I'd like a \Nhighball and seafood chirashi.
0.5;The great Mori Kogoro would \Nnever stoop to stealing!
0.5;I-I just happened to spill some \Nsoy sauce on myself earlier.
0.5;It's more soy sauce colored \Nthan blood colored, right?
0.5;It's just the base fare \Nfrom my office to here.
0.5;It was careless of me to celebrate my \Ndark horse payout ticket on the train.
0.5;I was willing to forgive \Nyou if you came clean.
0.5;And I'm sure you'd prefer \Nto get the police involved
0.5;The police will only have \Nto search your belongings.
0.5;the person who has either \Na million yen in cash
0.5;or the stolen dark horse \Nticket on them is the thief.
0.5;The thief's already a \Ncarp on a cutting board.
0.5;All that's left is for me to name \Nthem and for them to confess.
0.5;brazenly came to eat \Nsushi at this restaurant,
0.5;When my pouch was stolen,\NI grabbed the thief's sleeve
0.5;with my finger wrapped in \Na bloodstained band-aid.
0.5;But for some reason that blood \Nwasn't on anyone's sleeve.
0.5;The thief passed through this restaurant's \Nshop curtains to erase that blood.
0.5;But I'm sure Kogoro-san has \Nalready figured that out.
0.5;Let's leave the mystery \Nsolving to the professionals.
0.5;Seriously? So the Sleeping \NKogoro's nothing special.
0.5;I learned a lot about food \Nwhile working as a chef.
0.5;Do you know why they put \Nginger in ginger fried pork?
0.5;It's not because it's \Ncalled ginger fried pork.
0.5;because the proteins in \Nthem stick to the fibers.
0.5;If you wash bloodstained \Nclothes with ginger juice,
0.5;We serve thinly sliced ginger \Npickled in sweet vinegar.
0.5;So the man who ordered a \Nmountain of pickled ginger...
0.5;When you went to the bathroom to hide \Nthe pouch hidden in your jacket,
0.5;Didn't you say you wanted to leave because \Nthere's a show you want to watch?
0.5;Kogoro-san and his family came after \Nthe horse races ended just after four.
0.5;This woman barged in here \Nabout an hour later at five.
0.5;You said you wanted to leave after \Nthe argument about the theft,
0.5;If you walked here, it probably takes \Nyou less than thirty minutes to get home.
0.5;The enemy boss's adviser is supposed \Nto be on today's episode!
0.5;And you're so into it, you \Ndon't want to miss it?
0.5;but wouldn't my sleeve be the color of pickled \Nginger if I poured its juice on my sleeve?
0.5;Though I'm sure the color would come \Nout if I washed it right after this.
0.5;I don't have a million yen or \Na dark horse payout ticket.
0.5;If you don't have the \Nticket, you're innocent!
0.5;He accidentally put a ticket that \Nwas on the ground in his wallet.
0.5;I bet five thousand on a quinella \Nticket for first and second place.
0.5;The dark horse payout ticket \Nwas a quinella ticket...
0.5;Since you said you like mysteries, \NI thought I'd see what you could do.
0.5;But you still have a lot of \Nlearn, detective drifter.
0.5;But ginger isn't the only \Nthing they're found in.
0.5;gently pat the front and \Nback of a bloodstain,
0.5;The man who ordered the grilled fish, \Nwhich always comes with grated radish,
0.5;But maybe he happened to see it on the \Nmenu and wanted some grilled fish.
0.5;It proves he's been here before \Nand knows you serve grilled fish.
0.5;use their phone's GPS to \Ntrack him all the way here.
0.5;So why did you come here to remove \Nthe bloodstain on your sleeve?
0.5;You could've returned home and taken \Noff your shirt or thrown it away.
0.5;that didn't allow him to have \Na bloodstain on his sleeve.
0.5;That young man with the TV \Nshow he doesn't want to miss
0.5;and the woman who wants to go home \Nto participate in online auctions...
0.5;But not so for that \Nbespectacled man on his way
0.5;to meet someone for drinks \Nat an expensive restaurant.
0.5;who are so strict he's too \Nnervous to eat around them.
0.5;Who knows what they'd say if he \Nshowed up with blood on his sleeve?
0.5;How do you know the train \Nshe was in was full?
0.5;Why would a rich guy like \Nyou on his way to drinks
0.5;My savings have been \Ndrained, and I'm in debt.
0.5;While I was wondering \Nif I should borrow money
0.5;So I acted without thinking \Nout of desperation.
0.5;but I feel like a weight's \Nbeen lifted off my shoulders.
0.5;I had no idea where or how \Nto exchange it for cash.
0.5;Thirty minutes later, the police \Narrived at the restaurant.
0.5;Munechika-san was taken away with \Nthe slightly cheerful expression
0.5;The old man turned over his dark \Nhorse payout ticket to a police box.
0.5;General, the tiger is afraid \Nof me and won't come out!

0.5;We were playing in the park \Nacross in front of the house.
0.5;Apparently no one entered or \Nleft after Yahagi Emi-san.
0.5;You found an abandoned child and \Nwere looking for its mother?
0.5;Apparently she went to get her hat \Nthat was blown away by the wind.
0.5;So you're late because you \Nwere watching the stroller?
0.5;The question is whether or not \Nyour story can be verified.
0.5;You're the only person besides the victim \Nwho has a key to the side entrance.
0.5;You could've secretly returned to the house and \Nkilled her and gone back to shopping afterwards.
0.5;What's the name of the \Nwoman with the stroller?
0.5;Well, hello. This is \Nquite the mess, isn't it?
0.5;The missus was furious that\Nyou sold her a forgery.
0.5;I'll write you a prescription \Nfor the medicine right away.
0.5;Isn't there anything you \Ncan do so I can drive?
0.5;That bird that flies around with a \Nred piece of yarn trailing behind it?
0.5;Oh, I just thought you meant \NKokubo-san's myna bird.
0.5;I brought him because he \Nseemed to know the victim.
0.5;Despite what he says, he just wants \Nto stick his nose in the case.
0.5;But it looks like he was \Nright to bring the old man.
0.5;But the book she bought \Nfrom Sayama-san was...
0.5;But you still haven't \Nreturned her money, right?
0.5;Ma'am, shall I move the flowerpot \Nin the backyard to the kitchen?
0.5;They found strangulation \Nmarks on the victim's neck.
0.5;The weapon was the white stole the \Nvictim had wrapped around her neck.
0.5;No, the actual murder occurred \Nbetween 13:35 and 13:55.
0.5;I believe she stopped \Nwriting after a scandal.
0.5;Sayama-san was seen speaking \Nover his cell phone
0.5;Since he's famous, we \Nrecognized him right away.
0.5;The children can back up \NKokubo Mamoru-san's story,
0.5;The hospital is about halfway \Nbetween here and the station.
0.5;Yahagi Emi-san is the only person \Nwho has no one to verify her alibi.
0.5;but I can't believe he \Nwas only taught insults.
0.5;Ah, you mean when Kokubo-san \Nplagiarized her mentor.
0.5;But according to insiders, \Nit was the other way around.
0.5;It wasn't the missus who \Ncommitted plagiarism.
0.5;How much trouble did the \Nold woman have walking?
0.5;I think she said she could \Nbarely use a wheelchair.
0.5;The missus put it on him this morning so he'd \Nbe easily identifiable if he escaped again.
0.5;Sayama-san called him the \Nmyna bird with the red yarn.
0.5;After all, all three of \Nthe suspects have alibis.
0.5;However, there's one person \Nwhose alibi doesn't hold up.
0.5;Apparently you saw a myna bird \Nwith red yarn trailing behind him.
0.5;Nine left the yarn and his \Nleg band at the police box.
0.5;By the way, apparently the victim \Nattached the yarn to Nine this morning.
0.5;Sayama-san was seen at \NMidoridai Station at 12:55.
0.5;It would have been impossible for \Nhim to meet you at the hospital
0.5;after answering the victim's \Ncall at the station?
0.5;The victim told him to come \Nto her home immediately.
0.5;He could've arrived at the house \Nby the time the call ended.
0.5;used the main entrance based \Non the children's testimony.
0.5;The victim Kokubo Naoko-san \Nopened it herself.
0.5;the victim instructed him to bring in \Nthe flowerpot by the rear entrance.
0.5;Committing the crime and \Nleaving afterwards was simple.
0.5;Since the lock is semi-automatic, it locks \N after pushing a button and exiting.
0.5;Sayama-san, you're the one that \Nsaid this room stinks, aren't you?
0.5;The clever Nine even \Nremembered how you said it.
0.5;This allowed you to strangle \Nher with only one hand.
0.5;Returning the money wasn't \Nenough to forgive me.
0.5;I can't believe she had such \Na terrifying side to her.
0.5;It just goes to show women \Nare different on the inside.
0.5;What a surprise to see you \Nhere, Okiya Subaru-san.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Traitor's Stage, Part One!"""
0.5;Those clothes appear to be a traditional \Ninsect hunting outfit, but...
0.5;What are you trying to \Ncatch with that giant net?
0.5;I'm going insect man hunting. \NIt's every man's dream.
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;And why the adults of the village are doing \Nconstruction work at the village shrine.
0.5;An accurate history of the village \Noperated insect man ranch incident!
0.5;an important Japanese government \Nofficial came to this village.
0.5;"He said, ""I shall build a casino and public \Nbath in the forest surrounding this village."""
0.5;He opposed the idea because in the \Nforest was the grave of Princess Gaga,
0.5;He fell victim to Princess Gaga's curse \Nand was attacked by a giant moth!
0.5;and the plans to construct the casino \Nand public bath were put on hold.
0.5;The village mayor decided to build \Nan insect man ranch instead.
0.5;The insect man ranch is an amusement park \Nwhere children dress in insect costumes.
0.5;The village mayor paid for these \Ncostumes out of his own pocket.
0.5;When the children heard the \Nnews, they were overjoyed.
0.5;But the adults of the village \Nwere strongly opposed.
0.5;But later, after retiring \Nfrom being the village mayor,
0.5;he bought up the forest \Nwith his retirement pay,
0.5;"put up ""Do Not Enter"" signs, and \Nbegan construction with bulldozers."
0.5;That's when the former mayor \Ncame to this restaurant.
0.5;Unbelievably, a map showing the \Nlocation of Princess Gaga's treasure
0.5;so he could keep Princess Gaga's \Ntreasure all for himself.
0.5;Meanwhile, the children who \Nthe former mayor betrayed
0.5;were unable to give up on their \Ndream of an insect man ranch,
0.5;while the adults remain obsessed \Nwith Princess Gaga's treasure,
0.5;There's nothing happily \Never after about that.
0.5;Let's have some of the famous katsu bowls \Nthat appeared in the picture-story.
0.5;That kind of dish is beyond \Nwhat we can prepare.
0.5;I'm not hungry yet, so I'm \Ngoing to go for a walk.
0.5;Did the mayor really say he'd \Nopen an insect man ranch
0.5;so he could keep Princess \NGaga's treasure to himself?
0.5;Not only that, but he even paid for costumes \Nfor the village's children out of his own pocket.
0.5;Then there's the cursed giant moth that \Nchased the government official away.
0.5;you can rent an insect \Ncostume free of charge.
0.5;I'd like to see a record of deliveries \Nmade to the late former mayor.
0.5;In other words, the late former \Nmayor wore this moth costume
0.5;and waited for the officials \Nto come inspect the forest.
0.5;So the mayor was behind \NPrincess Gaga's curse.
0.5;Was it really to keep \Nher treasure to himself?
0.5;I'm the only daughter \Nof this clinic's owners.
0.5;Chono Masako, eleven years old, \NCapricorn, blood type AB.
0.5;I'd like to ask you about \Nthe late former mayor.
0.5;Patient information is confidential. \NI can't discuss it with you.
0.5;I might accidentally mention \Nsomething while examining you.
0.5;I heard from Daddy that he had only \Na year left by the time he retired.
0.5;You've got a lot of cholesterol in \Nyour brain from thinking too hard.
0.5;I know you're excited \Nabout being insect people,
0.5;but it's dangerous for us to \Nenter an off-limits forest.
0.5;So why did he spend his retirement pay to \Nkeep Princess Gaga's treasure to himself?
0.5;He even distributed costumes to the children \Nand lied about opening an insect man ranch.
0.5;Wait a minute. Does Princess \NGaga's treasure even exist?
0.5;so I thought I'd practice making \Nspiderwebs, but then I slipped.
0.5;Do you know if there's a book \Nhere on the village's history?
0.5;contains the grade school teacher's \Nresearch on the village's history.
0.5;the grave of the noble Princess Gaga once \Nexisted in the forest surrounding the village.
0.5;There's no mention of \NPrincess Gaga's treasure.
0.5;Then why did the mayor buy up the forest? \NWhat was the construction work for?
0.5;And then there's the treasure map \Nthe mayor had on him when he died.
0.5;I heard something coming \Nfrom the village shrine.
0.5;I told you it was dangerous \Nto enter an off-limits forest!
0.5;It's only natural for an insect \Nperson to want to enter the forest.
0.5;Mitsuhiko the dragonfly, there's \Nsomething wrong with you.
0.5;You kids dressed as insect people so you could \Nsteal Princess Gaga's treasure, didn't you?
0.5;No! We just wanted to enjoy \Nthe forest as insect people.
0.5;What are they, then? Do you \Nknow, Ayumi the ladybug?
0.5;Come down from there! Or do \Nyou want us to drag you down?
0.5;To prove it, there's no mention of the \Ntreasure in the village's historical documents!
0.5;The mayor tried to build the insect \Nman ranch you all opposed by himself.
0.5;He spread the rumor that he was trying to keep \NPrincess Gaga's non-existent treasure to himself,
0.5;Were there detailed excavation \Ninstructions written on the map?
0.5;And that's the result of following those \Nobnoxiously detailed excavation instructions.
0.5;The mayor didn't just leave behind the \Ntreasure map and excavation instructions.
0.5;They were plans to build \Na keyhole-shaped tomb.
0.5;He probably left it up to \Nyou to fulfill his dream
0.5;Doesn't it seem strange for an insect \Nman to be carrying a bug catching net?
0.5;There's nothing strange \Nabout it. After all...
0.5;It seems the victim Kadowaki Eiji-san \Nwas abusing his mother Yasuko-san daily.

0.5;Sergeant Momosaki Toko, who went to \Nkaraoke with Naeko Miike after work,
0.5;and there were traces suggesting that Sergeant \NMomosaki had been pointing at something.
0.5;Then, Lieutenant Yagi who was at the karaoke \Nbox with Miike and Sergeant Momosaki...
0.5;And next to her body is a 100 \Nyen coin stuck inside her phone.
0.5;Just like the one found next \Nto the body of the officer
0.5;discovered in the park this \Nmorning, it was deliberately bent.
0.5;100 yen coins are engraved \Nwith a cherry blossom.
0.5;It goes without saying that the cherry \Nblossom is the emblem of the Japanese police.
0.5;This case is a serial murder \Nof female police officers.
0.5;but since I'm helping the \Ninvestigation, go easy on me.
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Then do you know anything about \Nthis female police officer?
0.5;And there was that incident \Njust the other day, too.
0.5;Remember the woman who committed suicide \Nby jumping from a nearby building?
0.5;Don't the police know \Nmore about it than I do?
0.5;When no foul play is suspected, the MPD \Nisn't called to investigate the case.
0.5;The local jurisdiction \Ninvestigates it instead.
0.5;and asked to lie on the ground \Nin the same position as the body.
0.5;but in any case, it seemed \Nlike Yumi-san had an idea,
0.5;I was up all night playing \Nmahjong, so I'm so sleepy.
0.5;I realized what was in the direction \NYagi forced herself to face.
0.5;Since we drive past this \Nalleyway on our patrols,
0.5;anyone from the Transportation \NDepartment would know what's there.
0.5;Yagi faced this direction before she \Ndied because she knew that was here.
0.5;That sign's the only obvious \Nthing in that direction.
0.5;Sergeant Momosaki, who was killed first, \Nwas pointing at a swing set in the park.
0.5;What else was in the direction Momosaki \Npointed besides the swing set?
0.5;That's right. Momosaki wasn't \Npointing at the swing set,
0.5;Since Yagi knew the same \Nsign happened to be here,
0.5;Yagi realized what message Momosaki \Nwas trying to convey with that sign,
0.5;and this happened when \Nshe went to confirm it.
0.5;But she was trying to tell us \Nsomething until the very end.
0.5;...is some kind of direct hint to \Nthe identity of the suspect.
0.5;Aono was using his phone while \Ndriving and didn't have his license.
0.5;Akamine was driving a motorcycle \Nagainst traffic without a helmet.
0.5;Shiroyama was driving with an expired \Ninspection and wasn't wearing his seat belt.
0.5;If anything, I guess their \Nnames contain the characters
0.5;for the red, blue, and \Nwhite used in the sign.
0.5;But that doesn't tell \Nus which of them did it.
0.5;Come to think of it, what about \Nthe building's security cameras?
0.5;Apparently this building doesn't \Nhave security cameras installed.
0.5;They figured out the last number \NLieutenant Yagi tried to call.
0.5;but calling the number 7155 \Ndidn't connect us to anyone.
0.5;She pressed the call button because she \Nwanted to preserve the number 7155.
0.5;That way it would be left in the phone's \Nrecords even if the suspect broke her phone.
0.5;7155... Seven thousand \None hundred fifty-five?
0.5;They went to karaoke just \Nbefore they met the suspect.
0.5;Yeah, but she seems like her memory \Nwould be worse than a cat's.
0.5;but a week ago, one of this building's \Nresidents committed suicide.
0.5;Really? Sounds like we should ask \Nthe local jurisdiction about that.
0.5;That girl in the Transportation Department \Nmight look like my first love, but...
0.5;You know, like how people \Nsay cats have small brains.
0.5;A person might say their yard is the size of \Na cat's forehead to mean it's really small.
0.5;And these days, you don't enter numbers \Nto request songs at karaoke places.
0.5;In any case, let Miwako know if you \Nthink of anything relating to 7155.
0.5;But we're both officers of the \NTransportation Department.
0.5;You should let the violent \Ncrimes unit handle the case
0.5;We'll stay to canvas the \Narea a little longer.
0.5;Between me and Shiratori-kun,\Nwe can probably handle this area.
0.5;In that case, I'll go ask the local \Njurisdiction about that suicide.
0.5;Then I'll go the park where \Nthe first murder took place.
0.5;I might find something related \Nto 7155 in that park.
0.5;We heard two lady cops were \Nkilled one after another.
0.5;So we were guarding your \Nmini patrol car for you.
0.5;What's your problem? You're just \Na miniskirt officer anyway!
0.5;Should a cop be speaking like \Nthat to a law-abiding citizen?
0.5;Just imagine they're speaking \Nnonsense and ignore them.
0.5;Then perhaps it would be best if \Nyou got some fresh air to sober up.
0.5;She doesn't look like a woman \Nwho needs protection to me.
0.5;Detective Chiba, what are \Nyou doing here at this hour?
0.5;I saw the body of the \Npolicewoman here this morning.
0.5;At first I thought she was \Npointing at the swing set,
0.5;but I thought she might be pointing at \Nthe no parking sign behind it instead.
0.5;The same sign was near the second \Nfemale officer who was murdered.
0.5;So he's been to the crime \Nscene in Haido City, too.
0.5;Both of the victims belonged to \Nthe Transportation Department,
0.5;so you suspect the traffic \Nviolators they arrested, right?
0.5;So I thought there might be some \Nmeaning behind the road signs.
0.5;There's that, and we also determined \Nthat the second victim Lieutenant Yagi
0.5;entered the numbers 7155 into \Nher phone just before she died.
0.5;I thought there might be something relating \Nto those numbers at this park, so I came here.
0.5;Seven thousand five hundred fifty-five, \Nseven-one and five-five...
0.5;Wait a minute. What does the order \Nof those numbers mean again?
0.5;I told Ran-neechan I'd be staying \Nat the professor's house tonight,
0.5;I know. Could you drive me \Nto the professor's house?
0.5;Come to think of it, do I \Nhave Sato-san's phone number?
0.5;I left my car parked with the \Ntrunk open in an alleyway.
0.5;A stray cat jumped in, \Nand it won't stop crying.
0.5;I had no idea Japanese road signs \Nwere based off English ones.
0.5;she responded that it was only natural for \Na Transportation Department officer to know,
0.5;that there was no way she wouldn't \Nknow such common knowledge.
0.5;Japanese road signs are \Nbased off English ones...

0.5;It's an honor to work alongside \Nthe great detective Mori Kogoro.
0.5;Mori-san, is it true that you've determined \Nwho's responsible for the graffiti?
0.5;Yes. That's why I asked \Nall of you to come here.
0.5;you visited President Fukamachi \Nin the hospital, didn't you?
0.5;Was there some reason you \Ndidn't want me to visit him?
0.5;You're the one who pushed \NPresident Fukamachi, aren't you?
0.5;Once the president regains \Nconsciousness, we'll know you did it.
0.5;Your visit to the hospital has \Nnothing to do with the case.
0.5;is that Torahiko-san didn't \Nwrite the graffiti.
0.5;so he'd been keeping his \Nhair black for some time.
0.5;The night Iwata-san saw the culprit, \Nthis photo was taken at Airs Café.
0.5;Torahiko-san said he dyed his hair blond \Nthe day after the graffiti was discovered.
0.5;Iwata-san, after we met at the parking \Nlot today, you came here, didn't you?
0.5;There's donut crumbs on it, so \Nmaybe Ukaji-san threw it away.
0.5;Officers, could you have your forensics \Nteam examine that envelope?
0.5;I'm sure you'll find Iwata-san and \NUkaji-san's fingerprints on it.
0.5;But if you went after him directly, the \Npolice would investigate his associates
0.5;and discover he was threatening \Nyou and realize you did it.
0.5;to make everyone believe Director \NKiriyama was the target.
0.5;If Director Kiriyama was killed and \NUkaji-san got caught in the crossfire,
0.5;then suspicion would fall on Torahiko-kun, \Nwho was assumed to have vandalized the buildings.
0.5;Iwata-san, you left this inside \Nthe president's car, didn't you?
0.5;was dirty and old like the \None Fukamachi-san was holding.
0.5;Since you left it outside while washing \Nthe car, it's a little damp, too.

0.5;You were planning to blow \Nup me and the director?
0.5;Then the real bomb's still \Ninside the president's car?

0.5;Her own mother just died!\NWhy is she...
0.5;I take it your mother\Nwas still alive when you left?

0.5;All other doors\Nwere locked from the inside.
0.5;Meaning the killer was one of\Nthese three who used the front door!
0.5;Well, time-wise, we can\Nprobably discount Izumi-san.
0.5;Hold on! He has a\Nmotive for killing my mother!
0.5;He was on the\Nverge of being sued by her!
0.5;He wasted 300 million of\Nher money on a lousy investment!
0.5;I bet you pretended to leave,\Nand snuck in when the coast was clear!
0.5;If the time of death\Nwas between 9:10 and 9:20,
0.5;time-wise, Izumi-san\Ncouldn't have done it.
0.5;Don't you remember?\NIt was around 9:40...
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nhe was with us in Beika at 9:40...
0.5;I see. It'd take at least fifty to\Nsixty minutes to get there by car...
0.5;But, Miss. Didn't you have a\Nreason of your own to kill her, too?
0.5;Her mother severed all ties\Nwith her because of her fiance.
0.5;Apparently, her husband\Nis behind bars...
0.5;I heard you asked her for a loan,\Nbut were harshly brushed aside!
0.5;And that that fueled\Na big family quarrel...
0.5;You're the one who argued with\Nher and said you'd kill her someday!
0.5;So, what brought you\Nhere tonight, Chihiro-san?
0.5;I was called here.\NTo be lectured at.
0.5;Will you get serious,\Nyou lousy detective?!
0.5;And what brought\Nyou here, Yoshioka-san?
0.5;The circumstances definitely\Nindicate it was one of these two...
0.5;Here's the tape. Let me know if\Nyou remember or notice anything.
0.5;And it's at 8:40\Nexactly that he leaves.
0.5;Next is Chihiro-san.\NThe time is 8:50.
0.5;Then, ten minutes later, Ms. Ikuko\Nsteps out to speak with the guards.
0.5;I see. So the victim was\Nstill alive at this point.
0.5;What is it?\NSomething seems different...
0.5;But as there's no\Nresponse, he looks inside...
0.5;Why would you go outside\Nwhen there's a phone in here?
0.5;I was in shock. So I went\Nto my car to get my cell phone.
0.5;"You can't blame him;\Nhe found a dead body."
0.5;I'd be ruined if\Nthat were made public!
0.5;But that discussion\Nended with you killing her!
0.5;No! She was already\Ndead when I arrived!
0.5;So then you called the\Npolice after hiding it in your car?
0.5;You can give us your excuses\Ndown at the station.
0.5;I didn't do it!\NShe really was dead!
0.5;even though she\Nwas expecting visitors...
0.5;Her mouth is wide open,\Nbut there aren't any wrinkles at all!
0.5;Alright, Inspector.\NWe're ready to take her away.
0.5;Oh no! It'll be too late once\Nthe body is taken away!
0.5;She's in a bathrobe,\Nand with a face pack on.
0.5;even though she\Nwas expecting company.
0.5;That's definitely not how one\Nlooks before having company over...
0.5;But Yoshioka-san was supposed\Nto stop by after Chihiro-san, right?
0.5;And she was\Nstrangled to death, right?
0.5;But Ran-neechan\Npointed out that it's weird
0.5;It should have wrinkles\Nif she was in pain with it on.
0.5;She was dressed like this when\Nyou were here, right, Chihiro-san?
0.5;Kojima-san was\Nindeed dressed like this.
0.5;In which case, why would\Nthe killer redo her face pack?
0.5;What about her eyes, ears,\Nor lips, for example?
0.5;I was surprised by\Nhow her bright purple lips
0.5;Aha! So you put the face pack\Non and met with the guards!
0.5;Being turned down for the loan\Ncaused you to kill your own mother.
0.5;Your first slip-up was the\Nmalfunctioning security alarm.
0.5;Surprised, you quickly decided\Nto play the role of your mother.
0.5;With a face pack and\Na robe, you could fool them.
0.5;But in your rush, you met\Nthem with your lipstick still on.
0.5;But you had to remove\Nyour mother's lipstick...
0.5;after washing the face\Nand removing makeup.
0.5;Yes, I met the guards and\Nput the face pack on my mother!
0.5;But she was already\Ndead when I got here!
0.5;Everyone knows that\Nshe and I constantly fought...
0.5;I thought everyone\Nwould think I killed her, so I...
0.5;You have to believe me!\NI didn't do it!
0.5;There's no question that\Nshe tried to cover things up.
0.5;All it does is change\Nthe time of death to be--
0.5;Umm, is it okay\Nfor me to leave now?
0.5;I'm sure we'll need to talk\Nto you again at some point.
0.5;Sheesh! I told you\Nnot to hang around here!
0.5;How can we end this play if the\Nmain character leaves the stage?
0.5;I finally figured out\Nwho really killed her.
0.5;But you just said that\NChihiro-san did it!
0.5;Her unnecessary tampering altered\Nthe estimated time of death,
0.5;which ironically created\Nan alibi for the real killer.
0.5;You vouched that I was in Beika\Nwhen the murder took place!
0.5;then the murder\Ntook place before 8:50.
0.5;In other words,\Nyou could have done it, too.
0.5;Ridiculous! Are you saying\Nyou believe her?!
0.5;And what proof do you have\Nthat I killed the woman?!
0.5;Chihiro-san. Did your mother\Nhave poor eyesight?
0.5;Eh? Y-Yes. But she always wore\Ncontacts instead of glasses.
0.5;Please take another look\Nat the victim's body.
0.5;There weren't any\Ncontacts in her belongings!
0.5;Yes. The missing contact lens\Nis in your pants cuff, Izumi-san!
0.5;That's not a place it could\Njust happen to wind up.
0.5;It could only happen to someone\Nwith direct contact with the victim--
0.5;She said she was going\Nto sue me for all I had...
0.5;But I only invested\Nhow she told me...
0.5;Please! Anything but court!\NI'll pay it back, however long it--
0.5;I checked the land\Nyour parents live on.
0.5;They've agreed to do\Nanything to compensate me.
0.5;Family ties are such\Na wonderful thing, indeed.
0.5;She had to pay... for dragging\Nmy elderly parents into this...
0.5;Good work!\NYou saved the day yet again!
0.5;The police lost a great man\Nwhen you left the force!
0.5;Don't be stupid!\NI'm not talking cheap food here!
0.5;In other words,\None of you is the killer!
0.5;The blood on the table...\NAnd the tablecloth...
0.5;Next episode we'll fork the \Nrook and check the king!
0.5;As times change, difficult\Ncases increase in number!
0.5;Today's case involves three siblings!\NMysteries upon mysteries!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Ugh! And I came all this way\Nbecause he said it was a big incident...
0.5;Yeah, right! I'm not gonna search\Nfor some lousy missing iguana!
0.5;My car broke down on me.\NCould I ask for a lift to my villa up ahead?
0.5;My car broke down.\NThese folks gave me a ride.
0.5;Is that so? I'm Yamauchi,\Nthe caretaker of this villa.
0.5;It's nothing! I'm sure\Nhe would've done the same!
0.5;Are Koichi and\Nthe others already here?
0.5;Yes. Everyone is worried\Nbecause you're late.
0.5;I wonder. I bet they hope\NI died in an accident...
0.5;Say, Mori-san.\NTonight is my birthday party.
0.5;You didn't arrive on time,\NFather, so we were worried
0.5;you had gotten in an\Naccident along the way.
0.5;For sure! The company needs you\Nto stay well for a long time to come!
0.5;Chateau Petrus, 1979.\NFrom Koichi-sama.
0.5;Now then, let us toast\Nto Father's 58th birthday.
0.5;Just figured it wouldn't be\Nfunny if there was poison in it...
0.5;The overseas branch has taken\Nbig hits because of your poor forecasts.
0.5;And I hear you're going to be\Ndismissed and sent to a subsidiary.
0.5;What a harsh hello,\Nafter sending an invitation yourself.
0.5;We severed all ties five years ago!\NI'd never send you an invitation!
0.5;You're the one who called\Nme here to tell me something!
0.5;Tonight was supposed\Nto be a feast, too...
0.5;Say, what happened between\NHotta-san and Fumiko-san?
0.5;Good question. I've only been\Ntheir caretaker for two years,
0.5;Whiskey, huh?\NWhose present is this?
0.5;Looks like I can assume\Na bomb was planted in here.
0.5;Stay out! Please wait outside\Nuntil the police arrive!
0.5;The world's greatest detective,\NMori Kogoro!
0.5;Ah! The glass stuck\Nin him is from a bottle!
0.5;That's why there are\Nfragments all over Hotta-san's body!
0.5;I don't need you to tell me!\NI realized that long before you!
0.5;If anyone here holds a grudge\Nagainst Father... it's you, Fumiko!
0.5;Suddenly showing up now without\Nan invitation is undeniably strange!
0.5;Yes. I did hate him.\NEnough to want to kill him!
0.5;But I didn't do it.\NThough I do thank whoever did.
0.5;They've been cut\Nby a knife or something...
0.5;The bomb was planted\Ninside a whiskey box.
0.5;I believe it was a present\NRyoji-sama gave to him...
0.5;I remember because\NI took it to his room.
0.5;He hasn't gotten far,\Nif he left his car behind...
0.5;Eh? Does that mean\Nhe's still lurking about?!
0.5;It's probably best\Nto leave in our cars.
0.5;What?! Does that mean\Nwe can't leave this villa?!
0.5;Ryoji did this. There's\Nrubber stuck on his knife!
0.5;There's my car. But it's broken\Nand hardly in a usable state...
0.5;Isn't it obvious? If his tires\Nwere the only ones not slashed,
0.5;the police would suspect\Nhim right off the bat.
0.5;That's strange. He would still\Nbe suspected right off the bat
0.5;But if the killer's goal was actually\Nto trap everyone inside this villa...
0.5;In any event, Ryoji-san\Nis still lurking around here.
0.5;Make sure to stay\Ntogether and not go off alone!
0.5;Thanks, little boy. This is\Nthe most important thing to me.
0.5;He died, five years ago. Suicide--\Nno, it was more like murder.
0.5;That's why I left.\NI couldn't forgive my father...
0.5;Oh, I'm sorry. I guess there's\Nno point in telling this to a little kid...
0.5;Fumiko-san held a\Ngrudge against Hotta-san.
0.5;But did she have a chance to\Nplant the bomb in the whiskey box?
0.5;Chemical fertilizer!\NCould that bomb have been...
0.5;Sulfur and chemicals!\NAnd that chemical fertilizer!
0.5;I've never seen\Na car like this before!
0.5;Huh? It's an old-style car,\Nbut it has an airbag...
0.5;Uhh, Conan-kun,\Ncould you go get Fumiko-san?
0.5;To get the police. Everyone feels\Nuneasy with just Mori-san, right?
0.5;I'm the caretaker. I have\Na responsibility to stay here.
0.5;There's no need to be shocked.\NThis photograph was in your room.
0.5;You went into my\Nroom without permission?!
0.5;I found something\Ninteresting in there...
0.5;Sulfur and other chemicals,\Nhidden inside a cabinet.
0.5;The explosive wasn't dynamite.\NIt was a homemade bomb
0.5;made of chemical fertilizer,\Nsulfur, and other chemicals!
0.5;If mixed properly, it can produce\Nan explosive as powerful as dynamite.
0.5;Ridiculous! Why would I want\Nto kill the master of the house?!
0.5;This incident was entirely to\Navenge the person in that photograph.
0.5;Hotta-san drove him\Nto suicide five years ago.
0.5;And he was your son,\NYamauchi-san.
0.5;You were the one who\Ntook Ryoji-san's whiskey
0.5;and delivered it\Nto Hotta-san's room.
0.5;That's when you placed the\Nhomemade explosive inside the box,
0.5;and easily-ignited\Nphosphorous in the bomb.
0.5;But it wasn't meant\Nto be a perfect crime.
0.5;Because you needed to\Ndistance yourself from suspicion
0.5;Well done, Mori-san.\NIt is just as you say.
0.5;My son Kentaro was an extraordinary\Npianist with a bright future.
0.5;He had dated a girl for a long time,\Nbut because of his paltry income,
0.5;But five years ago, he won a\Ncompetition and finally earned appraisal.
0.5;And then Kentaro\Nproposed to her. But...
0.5;...the woman's father--\NHotta-san-- was against it.
0.5;Kentaro met with Hotta to\Nget permission to marry her.
0.5;But Hotta not only refused,\Nbut he ruined Kentaro's fingers as well!
0.5;What's more, the woman ran off,\Nleaving him behind devastated!
0.5;Upon learning all of this after his funeral,\NI was shocked to realize
0.5;that as a company man,\NI had known nothing about my own son...
0.5;And that's why you\Ndecided to get revenge...
0.5;Yes. After quitting the company,\NI investigated Hotta
0.5;and became his caretaker to\Nfind a chance to exact revenge.
0.5;But Fumiko had left the family,\Nand it took me two years to locate her.
0.5;Then you chose Hotta-san's\Nbirthday party as the stage for revenge
0.5;But Fumiko-san is safe\Nand sound in the car--
0.5;The airbag is set to go off\Nwhen she steps hard on the brakes.
0.5;Why do you think Fumiko-san\Nis still single, after all this time?
0.5;Because even now,\Nshe continues to love Kentaro-san!
0.5;Absurd! A rude woman disowned\Nby her father would never do that!
0.5;She wasn't disowned!\NShe left on her own!
0.5;She couldn't forgive her father\Nfor what he did to Kentaro-san!
0.5;Fumiko-san always\Nwears it at all times.
0.5;Even now, Kentaro-san is the\Ndearest person to her, Yamauchi-san!
0.5;No. Mori-san had Conan-kun\Ntell me to come back right away...
0.5;I hated my father, too.\NEnough to want to kill him.
0.5;But I can't forgive\NKentaro-san, either.
0.5;Ryoji-san had been\Nlocked up in the basement.
0.5;Man, I'm hungry. Oh, that's right!\NWe're about to have breakfast!
0.5;I'm so hungry I could die!\NAnything'll do, just please hurry!
0.5;It's strange!\NSomething isn't right!
0.5;You're supposed to wash makeup\Noff before applying a face pack!
0.5;T-That's it! That person\Nreally is the killer!
0.5;You said that yesterday, \Nand I turned you down.
0.5;I don't mean to be rude, but you don't \Nlook the slightest bit busy to me.
0.5;I don't believe I'm getting \Nthrough to you, so once again!
0.5;And it's not like you know the \Nguy who disappeared, right?
0.5;"And he was the spitting \Nimage of ""The Mirage,"""
0.5;So you followed him and \Nsecretly took his picture.
0.5;Which means this is the \Nbirth of Detective Funachi!
0.5;A simple request to find someone \Nturns into a surprising case.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Is Hikone-san the name of \Nthe guy who disappeared?
0.5;I borrowed the name Funachi\Nfrom the heroine
0.5;"who adores ""The Mirage"" \Nin a famous otome game."
0.5;Additionally, based on the game's \Nworld view and setting...
0.5;When I came here the evening \Nof the day before yesterday,
0.5;Actually, since this is the second floor, \NI don't think that's the slightest bit possible.
0.5;She suffers from delusions. \NOr mirages, as it were.
0.5;Do you know where your \Nneighbor Hikone-san went?
0.5;Sorry. I'm looking for \Nyour neighbor, Hikone-san.
0.5;Funachi, is the reason you can't go to \Nthe police related to that notebook?
0.5;Could it be that you're a \Ndetective as well, Edogawa-sama?
0.5;In other words, my concerns about \Nconfidentiality have been eliminated.
0.5;I entered this place \Nyesterday and found that.
0.5;So once a month the jewels are \Nswapped out for more valuable ones.
0.5;Today is the day he plans \Nto commit that crime.
0.5;He's detailed how the jewels \Nare brought in, too.
0.5;However, I was unable to find a store \Nmatching the one in the notebook.
0.5;must be wearing a mask \Nand holding a pistol...
0.5;The locks on the doors and \Ncases wouldn't work this way.
0.5;And this location is only a \Ntwo or three minute walk away!
0.5;That was some impressive deduction \Nand following of clues.
0.5;But if we ran into Hikone-sama \Nas he's committing his robbery...
0.5;"This is Tenbun Publishing's ""Tenbun \NMonthly"" editorial department."
0.5;"The novel ""Crime Plan"" he\Nbrought in the other day"
0.5;and that notebook contains the results\Nof his research for his writing.
0.5;In other words, this is just \None of my usual coincidences.
0.5;Hikone-sama must have some imagination \Nfor me to mistake this for reality!
0.5;It would be no exaggeration \Nto call it godlike!
0.5;More than anything, Hikone-san himself \Nhas been missing for two days.
0.5;New jewels were being \Nbrought in today, right?
0.5;A robber who entered the basement \Nboiler room through the sewer...
0.5;Make it look like he left the way \Nhe came, but flee above ground.
0.5;"""Make them believe I fled, eliminate \Nplanner nearby, and return to everyday life."""
0.5;Funachi, why did the paper \Nfly into the air then?
0.5;A gust of wind suddenly \Nblew through the room.
0.5;That's why the paper didn't fly \Nwhen we first opened the door.
0.5;Nashida-sama, you were watching Hikone-sama \Nwrite his novel through that space.
0.5;broke the lock, entered\Nthe room, and stole it.
0.5;If it's not in your apartment, \Nperhaps you pawned it.
0.5;Are you sure you don't have a pawn ticket \Nand cash in your pocket right now?
0.5;You stole and read this crime plan, robbed \Nthe jeweler, and killed Hikone-sama!
0.5;But by the time I entered, \Nthe lock was already broken!
0.5;Funachi, was it the first time \Nthe papers flew into the air
0.5;If you look through that hole,\Ncouldn't you see Hikone-sama's back,
0.5;break the lock and enter, read his \Nnotebook, and put it into action?
0.5;You should have worn your \Nboots the whole time.
0.5;you wouldn't have gotten mud on you, \Nbut you did because you ran above ground.
0.5;Two parallel streets run \Nbetween here and the jeweler,
0.5;but we didn't see Kiyose-sama \Nwhile traveling along one of them.
0.5;I believe the other is still \Nmuddy from yesterday's rain.
0.5;It broke off into the hem of your \Npants when you broke the lock.
0.5;Kiyose-sama, you didn't have \Nthose coin locker keys earlier.
0.5;But that doesn't make it \Nacceptable to kill someone!
0.5;If he was attacked outside, \Nthey would have stolen his keys,
0.5;I was fed up with my lack of talent, \Nso I've been wandering around.
0.5;But I ran out of money, \Nso I had to come back here.
0.5;She gave a far more detailed \Nexplanation than the employees.
0.5;So you were lying about spotting \NHikone-san in the street?
0.5;Rather, I simply believed he \Ncouldn't possibly remember me,
0.5;so I made the calm and \Nobjective decision to...
0.5;Could this be a happy \Nending for you, Funachi?
0.5;They told me to be in front \Nof this building at eight.
0.5;Detective Takagi said the \Nlocation they tried to drop him
0.5;and the location he actually \Nfell were different.
0.5;You're thinking something \Nunbelievable, aren't you?
0.5;"The next episode of Conan \Nis ""The Moving Target!"""
0.5;Apparently the professor saved their\Ncompany with one of his inventions.
0.5;He makes inventions for\Nadults sometimes, does he?
0.5;Won't it be hard to practice\Nif the ground is uneven?
0.5;"""The Detective Boys' Locked\NRoom Mystery Battle!"""
0.5;A man was found dead in\Nthe pool of this empty lot.
0.5;Earlier I came to unlock this\Nplace so you kids could get inside.
0.5;Does that make you the\Nfirst discoverer, Professor?
0.5;It's for a family, so I think\Nit's about ten meters.
0.5;And this gate is the only\Nway to get to the pool?
0.5;But when I got here,\Nthe gate was locked up tight.
0.5;According to my friend who lent\Nus this place, this is the only key.
0.5;Inspector Megure is troubled\Nby that very question.
0.5;The entrance has been closed for\Nthe entirety of the past three days.
0.5;but we believe he was killed by\Na blow to the back of the head.
0.5;If it was a murder, then we don't\Nknow how the culprit escaped.
0.5;That means this empty lot is a\Nlocked room without a roof!
0.5;It's fine that you're excited,\Nbut if this is a crime scene,
0.5;Both the victim and culprit had to pass\Nthrough this lot to get to the crime scene.
0.5;Until the case is solved,\Nit's closed to the public.
0.5;Isn't there anything you\Ncan do, Inspector Megure?
0.5;Though it'd be a different story if\Nyou Detective Boys solved the case.
0.5;And the professor went through\Nthe trouble of getting us this lot.
0.5;If we can figure out how the victim got\Nhere, the inspector will consider it!
0.5;Here's a plan of the place\NI got from my friend.
0.5;No, there's a narrow road\Nrunning between them.
0.5;What if you climbed the fence from\Nthat road and entered the lot?
0.5;There's embedded glass and\Nbarbed wire on top of the fence.
0.5;It looks like the neighbors are getting\Nready for some construction, too.
0.5;If you flew here on a helicopter\Nand climbed down...
0.5;You wouldn't be able to\Nland in such a small space.
0.5;Hot air balloons float using\Nair heated by the burners.
0.5;That's fine, but aren't you forgetting\Nsomething important?
0.5;Why did he go through so much\Ntrouble to sneak into the pool?
0.5;the victim was trying to sneak\Ninto somewhere else.
0.5;You know the answer, but\Nyou're only dropping hints.
0.5;He was killed by a blow to\Nthe back of the head, so...
0.5;He fell from the neighboring building and\Nhit his head on the bottom of the pool.
0.5;Unfortunately, Detective Boys, we\Nreached that conclusion as well.
0.5;Through the seventh floor,\Nall the windows are fixed shut.
0.5;I heard some disquieting rumors,\Nso I had my window altered.
0.5;Were the disquieting rumors\Nthe old woman heard...?
0.5;They call him the Gecko because\Nhe can climb any wall.
0.5;Where did the Gecko\Npractice climbing any wall?
0.5;It's a sport in which people climb\Nwalls using bumps on the wall.
0.5;That thing like rock climbing where\Nthey climb walls bare-handed?
0.5;According to our investigation, the Gecko\Nmade money working as a street artist.
0.5;They're people who put on\Nperformances in the city.
0.5;The Gecko's trick was crossing from one\Nbuilding to another on a tightrope.
0.5;But while crossing between two\Nbuildings on either side of a river,
0.5;After that, he became possessed by fear and\Nwas unable to perform the same trick again.
0.5;the Gecko returned home and started\Nusing his agility to break into buildings.
0.5;But even if he could climb the walls, he\Ncouldn't break into the buildings, right?
0.5;He must not have known the\Nwindow had been remodeled.
0.5;He must have intended to\Nenter through the bay window.
0.5;But if was a veteran thief,\Nwouldn't he have done his research?
0.5;I'm sure he did, but the window\Nwas remodeled yesterday.
0.5;The window hadn't been altered\Nyet when he did his research.
0.5;He struggled his way up the building,\Nbut when the window wouldn't open,
0.5;Would a professional fall\Nover something so small?
0.5;Now that you mention it,\Nit does seem unnatural.
0.5;If we could explain that one\Nthing, the case would be solved.
0.5;I doubt you'll get to practice\Ntomorrow, either.
0.5;Unfortunately, the power was\Nout in this area at that time.
0.5;The substation malfunctioned\Nbecause of the lightning.
0.5;The lightning would have struck\Nthe top of the building.
0.5;But all three lightning strikes\Nstruck the substation.
0.5;Then he looked into the\Nroom through the window.
0.5;I've known her for a while,\Nbut she's a quiet, kind woman.
0.5;Her legs are weak, so she uses a cane\Nand wheelchair to get around.
0.5;But she likes keeping tidy, so she's always\Ndoing the laundry when she's got time.
0.5;Professor, you've been to the\Nold woman's room, right?
0.5;Sure. I'm the one who introduced\NInspector Megure to her, too.
0.5;My hand shook when I grabbed\Nthe hose while doing the laundry.
0.5;You came all the way here, but\NI have nowhere for you to sit.
0.5;But if the power was out, he wouldn't\Nhave been able to see inside.
0.5;As you know, this morning\Nthe body of a thief,
0.5;known as the Gecko, was found in the\Npool of the demolished mansion next door.
0.5;but we determined he died when\Nsomething caused him to fall
0.5;while climbing this building to sneak in,\Nand hit his head on the floor of the pool.
0.5;True to his name, the Gecko committed\Nseveral thefts by climbing the wall
0.5;It's hard to imagine the Gecko\Nfalling over a mere slip.
0.5;Last night's lightning must\Nhave been quite shocking.
0.5;You may not have been struck,\Nbut the noise must have been loud.
0.5;Then the power went out, and you\Nstarted to return to the living room.
0.5;When you looked out the window,\Nyou saw a man stuck to your window.
0.5;You reflexively sprayed\Nthe man with your hose.
0.5;The window doesn't open, so there's no\Nway the things outside would get wet.
0.5;You're not responsible for\Nanything that happened.
0.5;But until we knew what happened,\Nwe couldn't close the case.
0.5;The next episode of Conan is\N“After That Hundred Million Yen!”
0.5;High school student Shinichi was\Nshrunken by a mysterious organization!
0.5;If they found out that Shinichi\Nand Conan are the same person,
0.5;I can't even tell Ran,\Nmy childhood friend,
0.5;This woman is none other\Nthan your wife, Maru Ineko-san!
0.5;How long is Kogoro\Ngoing to make us wait?
0.5;He said he was going to\Ntake us out to eat for once,
0.5;but then he had to\Nstop by this place first...
0.5;What detective in their right mind\Nwould bring a kid along
0.5;when informing someone\Nabout their spouse's affair?
0.5;I asked the housekeepers to waste time\Noutside since you were coming.
0.5;Excuse me while I see\Nmy visitor to the cottage.
0.5;Sorry to keep you waiting.\NLet's go to the cottage.
0.5;That's annoying!\NWhat's that old man doing, anyway?!
0.5;He probably can't hear it\Nbecause he's in the cottage!
0.5;Where in the world is he?!\NIt's been two hours now!
0.5;Another single ring!\NWhat's going on?
0.5;I've had enough!\NI'm going to the cottage!
0.5;No! I'm a detective--\NI was hired by this house's owner!
0.5;What business does\Na detective have here?!
0.5;He went over to the cottage\Nand hasn't come back...
0.5;I'll pay you twice as much as he is!\NJust keep my affair a secret!
0.5;The victim is Maru Denjiro,\N51 years old.
0.5;Your husband practiced\NIai swordsmanship, is that right?
0.5;He must have been\Nrather skilled, then...
0.5;Yes. He kept it as\Na decoration in the alcove.
0.5;it appears he and the murderer\Nhad quite the swordfight.
0.5;Which means that the killer must\Nhave been an expert swordsman as well.
0.5;Conan-kun. You're certain\Nyou saw the visitor, right?
0.5;Mori Kogoro, Suwa Yuji,\NHatano Ikuya, and Akutsu Makoto...
0.5;So 3 of the 4 people\Nfrom his organizer are here.
0.5;The killer would be the person\Nwho had already been here!
0.5;And that person would be the last\None to show up: Suwa Yuji-san!
0.5;I am Suwa. What exactly is\Nall the commotion here about?
0.5;See that small scar between\Nyour thumb and index finger?
0.5;People who practice swordsmanship\Noften cut themselves there
0.5;So that's why I figured\Nyou were into swords.
0.5;The killer was clearly\Na skilled swordsman!
0.5;I'm only here to pay back Maru-san\Nthe 5 million yen he lent me!
0.5;The murder took place\Nbetween 3 and 5 o'clock.
0.5;I believe I was\Nmeditating alone at my dojo...
0.5;The way he's holding his sword...\Nit's backwards!
0.5;The corpse's hands are\Nholding it the wrong way!
0.5;So does that mean someone put\Nthe sword in his hands afterwards?!
0.5;Plus, regardless of how much\Nthey may have fought,
0.5;it's still unnatural for the walls\Nand ceiling to be cut this badly!
0.5;Ah! So the killer tried\Nto frame Suwa-san
0.5;by cutting up everything\Nin the room with a sword?
0.5;by messing up the\Ncorpse's grip on the sword!
0.5;I borrowed money from Maru-san too...\N10 million yen...
0.5;No, I needed more time,\Nso I came to ask for an extension...
0.5;Of course. The victim planned\Nto see you today, too.
0.5;I simply came to report about\Nsomething he hired me to look in to.
0.5;To see if his wife was\Ncheating on him or not.
0.5;Jeez! Detectives aren't supposed\Nto tell people about their cases!
0.5;Where were you when\Nthe murder took place?
0.5;Wait, I just smelled\Nthis somewhere before...
0.5;I know! Don't tell me you're the one\Nshe's been seeing on the side?!
0.5;I'll confess now that\Nthere's no point in hiding it,
0.5;We were both at the Beika Hotel\Nfrom afternoon until evening!
0.5;Are you sure the two of you didn't\Narrange to say the same story?!
0.5;Whatever the case,\Nexcluding old man Kogoro,
0.5;Oh, well. Anyway, I'll be there\Nat 5:00, as we agreed.
0.5;I was planning to be there at 6:00,\Nbut I think I may arrive early.
0.5;I've made arrangements for\Nnext month's level examinations.
0.5;I'll give you the details\Nat a later time.
0.5;Suwa-san was set for 6:00 but called\Nahead and arrived at 5:00, correct?
0.5;I left a message on\Nthe answering machine too!
0.5;I said I was going to be a little late\Nbut that I would pay him back!
0.5;I also told him that I would\Nkill him if he sold it!
0.5;He said he would sell the carving\NI lent him if I didn't pay him back!
0.5;There's something strange\Nabout that carving!
0.5;That's great! You weren't\Ndamaged one bit!
0.5;It's a miracle that your carving was\Nthe only thing unharmed in this room!
0.5;You killed Maru-san and tried\Nto put the blame on Suwa-san.
0.5;First, you made the corpse\Nhold the sword the wrong way.
0.5;Second, you couldn't\Ndamage the dragon carving.
0.5;It looks like you\Ndidn't mind killing someone,
0.5;but couldn't bear to bring harm\Nto your precious carving!
0.5;Then why did you lie about leaving\Na message on his answering machine?!
0.5;I didn't lie! I really\Ndid leave a message!
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nthe phone rang three times!
0.5;The 2nd and 3rd times,\Nit stopped ringing right away,
0.5;Say, mister! Did anything\Nseem strange when you called?
0.5;Like maybe nobody would pick up,\Nor something?
0.5;Now that you mention it,\NI left it ringing for a long time.
0.5;Just when I thought I finally got through,\NI got his answering machine.
0.5;Our answering machine is set\Nto take messages after 10 rings.
0.5;It was shortly before our appointment,\Nso it was before 4:00.
0.5;But there's no message from him\Non the answering machine...
0.5;Now that I think about it, there is\Nsomeone who left a strange message!
0.5;Yes, there's a safe key\Nin one of the drawers!
0.5;But that's strange! My husband\Nalways kept it in this one!
0.5;None of the large\Nsword cuts are connected!
0.5;That inspector says\Nhe'd like to borrow it.
0.5;"What part of ""get out of here""\Ndon't you understand?!"
0.5;At any rate, I'll have to\Ntake you down to the station.
0.5;I've figured it out\Nfor sure this time, Inspector.
0.5;Hey now, Suwa-san\Npractices swordsmanship--
0.5;he wouldn't have made the corpse\Nhold the sword incorrectly...
0.5;...which is exactly\Nwhat Suwa-san wanted!
0.5;To make himself look suspicious,\Nhe put sword cuts all over the room
0.5;and then put the sword\Nin the victim's hands.
0.5;But he provided himself\Nwith an escape route
0.5;by making the victim\Nhold the sword incorrectly.
0.5;By doing this, he made it look\Nlike someone had tried to frame him,
0.5;and thus he was able to remove\Nhimself of any suspicion.
0.5;Do you really intend to accuse me\Nof this with nothing but conjecture?
0.5;You were the one who just accused\NAkutsu-san of being the murderer!
0.5;in order to make\NAkutsu-san look suspicious!
0.5;Nonsense. This is\Nthe first time we've met.
0.5;How would I have known\Nthe dragon belonged to him?
0.5;My guess is that you heard it\Nwhile committing the murder.
0.5;If you sell the dragon carving\NI left with you, I swear I'll kill you!
0.5;So you probably came up with a plan\Non the spot to frame Akutsu-san.
0.5;That's because Suwa-san\Nrewound the tape
0.5;and recorded his own message\Nover the first one!
0.5;But Dr. Hatano could\Nhave done that too.
0.5;In your message, you confessed that you,\Nyourself, were the murderer!
0.5;You left a message that you would\Narrive earlier than planned.
0.5;Going early to someone's house\Neven though you know they're not home?
0.5;You said that because you knew that\NMaru-san was here, in the cottage,
0.5;so he asked me to come at\Nany time other than that.
0.5;So I figured that coming before our\Nappointed 6:00 was fine with him.
0.5;There is definitive proof in\Nthis room that you are the murderer!
0.5;The drawers were switched\Naround purposely by the killer.
0.5;take the drawer on the top row,\N2nd from the left,
0.5;and switch it with the rightmost\Ndrawer of the same row.
0.5;Next, take the leftmost drawer\Nof the next row down
0.5;and switch it with the\Nleftmost drawer of the 5th row.
0.5;The 2nd row, 2nd column and the\Nrightmost drawer of the same row.
0.5;3rd row, 2nd column and the\Nrightmost drawer of the 4th row.
0.5;My guess is that while Suwa-san was\Nbusy erasing Akutsu-san's message,
0.5;Having realized this,\Nyou switched the drawers around
0.5;and put your own cut marks on them\Nto make the letters illegible.
0.5;But the drawers would stand out\Nas the only things damaged,
0.5;so you cut up everything else\Nin the room too.
0.5;The sword that I left\Nwith him as collateral...
0.5;Let's consider the money I received\Nfor it as the interest on your loan.
0.5;Before I knew it, I had struck\Nhim down with the sword.
0.5;Even so, the fact that you didn't\Neven flinch when I attacked...
0.5;You are indeed an extraordinary detective,\NMori Kogoro-dono.
0.5;Incidentally, the old man's injury\Nturned out to be a 3-millimeter scratch.
0.5;Conan and the others are\Nat the department store.
0.5;Next episode takes place at a\Ncreepy department store late at night.
0.5;Even heaven is watching the \Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills \Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;The truth behind Akai and \NScotch's relationship.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;You were supposed to turn right \Nat the last intersection.
0.5;Does that mean you weren't \Nlistening to what I was saying?
0.5;I have to investigate it before it becomes \Npublic and destroy it if necessary, right?
0.5;If you have trouble getting to him, I \Ncould have an acquaintance disguise you.
0.5;Why do a couple of high school \Ngirls have to clean the house
0.5;This place is too large \Nfor me to clean by myself.
0.5;By the way, her name's \NSera Masumi-san, right?
0.5;But she said she was too busy \Nsince she's moving hotels again.
0.5;For example, a person constantly \Nobserving their surroundings
0.5;the title of the new song \Nrock musician Hado Rokumichi
0.5;Apparently he finally wrote lyrics to a \Nsong he composed seventeen years ago,
0.5;and is going to perform \Nit at his next concert.
0.5;It was written in the English alphabet \Nwhen it was announced online,
0.5;"but the ""CA"" in ASACA was \Nspelled ""CA"" instead of ""KA."""
0.5;If you're so curious, why \Ndon't you ask him yourself?
0.5;We're going to watch Hado \NRokumichi rehearse soon.
0.5;By the way, when was the \Ntitle announced online?
0.5;Since it's his first song in five \Nyears, it was a popular news story.
0.5;He actually hasn't finished the \Nlyrics to his new song yet.
0.5;Apparently this is going \Nto be his last concert.
0.5;but he's going to tell his fans at \Nthe end of tomorrow's concert.
0.5;Especially when you were yelling \Nabout taking him to court
0.5;and charging him an exorbitant \Npenalty for breaking the contract.
0.5;I bought one of the staff's \Njackets and used it to get in.
0.5;Rumor is the ASACA of the \Ntitle of Hado's new song
0.5;Well, I heard that your chief \Neditor was furious with you
0.5;because someone beat you to reporting that \NHado was putting his music career on hold.
0.5;You'd been following Hado for fifteen \Nyears, so what were you doing?
0.5;That's why I pretended to be \Na staff member to get in here.
0.5;I wanted to make an explosive \Ncomeback before Hado quits.
0.5;This man isn't allowed \Nin here. Throw him out.
0.5;There's no telling when \Nthe rehearsal will start.
0.5;But shouldn't we watch the rehearsal if \Nthis is going to be his last concert?
0.5;When I told them at Poirot that \NI was a huge fan of Hado-san,
0.5;Sonoko-san's Suzuki \NConglomerate happens to be
0.5;I kept it hidden at the store, \Nbut I'm a huge fan, too.
0.5;I followed Amuro-san here \Nafter my shift ended.
0.5;She stopped me as I was \Nentering the building.
0.5;The staff let us in after \Nwe explained the situation.
0.5;Speaking of surprises, what \Na surprise to see you here,
0.5;You like Hado-san because \Nhe's a good guitarist, right?
0.5;What? Azusa-san, didn't you say \Nyou've never touched a guitar?
0.5;Yeah, when we invited you to \Njoin our band the other day.
0.5;I was just too embarrassed to \Njoin a high school girl band.
0.5;Which means I need to get Subaru-san \Nout of here as soon as possible.
0.5;The most perceptive man of \Nthe Organization, Bourbon.
0.5;The high school detective transformed \Ninto a child by a drug, Kudo Shinichi.
0.5;If this was done by one person, they \Nmust have been incredibly strong.
0.5;I noticed you had exceptional \Ndeductive skills.
0.5;There's a hole as though something \Nwas pressed into the rope.
0.5;There's a folding chair, rope, and \Ntoolbox on the edge of the stage.
0.5;He was going to perform \Na concert here tomorrow.
0.5;he's probably been dead for \Nabout an hour or two.
0.5;Hado had been in here for \Naround two hours writing lyrics.
0.5;And during that time someone \Nentered the auditorium,
0.5;hanged the victim by his \Nneck, and killed him.
0.5;They probably passed a \Nrope over the metal bars
0.5;and lifted him using the machine \Nfor moving the heavy curtains.
0.5;The room with the curtain \Ncontrols was locked.
0.5;When the murder took place, the staff \Nwho had the key were out to lunch.
0.5;Then did they lift him \Nwithout using the machine?
0.5;Without pulleys attached \Nto the bar above the stage,
0.5;Another point of interest is the \Nfolding chair, leftover rope,
0.5;near the knot in the rope \Nattached to the seats.
0.5;Anyway, I can't believe how often \Nwe run into various detectives.
0.5;Yeah, although Conan-kun deserves \Nan award for his perfect attendance.
0.5;during Hado-san's estimated time \Nof death between 4:30 to 5:30,
0.5;the only persons who weren't seen for \Na while were Fuse-san and Enjo-san.
0.5;I told you, I've had an upset \Nstomach since this morning.
0.5;I was running around the concert hall \Nissuing instructions to the staff.
0.5;by the firefighters who came \Nto perform an inspection.
0.5;Detective, shouldn't he be \Nconsidered suspicious as well?
0.5;I bought a jacket from the staff \Nand entered the auditorium
0.5;If you think I'm lying, ask the \Nguy who sold me his jacket.
0.5;and Fuse-san was missing \Nbetween 5:00 to 5:15.
0.5;So it wasn't possible for any \Nof them to have worked together.
0.5;Apparently, he was an outfielder \Nwith a strong throwing arm.
0.5;from his team when he \Ngraduated high school.
0.5;You dated Hado from around that time \Nuntil he started getting popular, right?
0.5;And then, that company president fell \Nin love with this beautiful manager
0.5;are behind your twisted \Nrelationships and Hado's death?
0.5;By the way, do you know where \NHado-san's cell phone is?
0.5;We couldn't find it in the \Ngreen room or with his things.
0.5;Hado always kept his cell \Nphone in his breast pocket.
0.5;I shot the cell phone he \Nhad in his breast pocket.
0.5;We found this paper in \NHado-san's breast pocket.
0.5;We're having everyone in the auditorium \Nwrite it so we can perform a handwriting analysis.
0.5;She knows I've seen through her \Ndisguise, but she's still so brazen.
0.5;to keep Ran and Sonoko \Nfrom getting involved.
0.5;I'm surprised you knew \NAzusa-san's family name.
0.5;If you'd told me beforehand, I could've \Nprovided more detailed information.
0.5;I can handle investigating the lyrics \Nof a not-yet-performed song myself.
0.5;I felt uneasy when I heard \Nyou were coming with them.
0.5;He's a Toto University grad \Nstudent named Okiya Subaru.
0.5;He lives next door to \Nan inventor named Agasa.
0.5;When we met the other day, you removed \Nyour mask with your right hand.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Traitor's Stage, Part 2!"""
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 809 \N""The Kamaitachi Inn (Part 2)"""
0.5;Invited by Hattori Heiji, we came to \Na famous hot spring inn in Nagano.
0.5;In the storehouse of the inn, \NHattori, Kogoro-no-occhan,
0.5;and inn guest Koyanagi Midori-san \Nwere cut by something sharp.
0.5;With the same feelings we've \Nalways held still in our hearts,
0.5;The duo's deduction reveals the identity \Nof the kamaitachi who runs on water.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Since rigor mortis hasn't set in yet, it's \Nbeen less than thirty minutes since he died.
0.5;Since we didn't find any blood \Nwhen we examined it earlier,
0.5;so I put it back in the storehouse \Nand sent forensics home.
0.5;This sliding door was cut by the sickle \Nsticking out of the old man, right?
0.5;that means he stabbed the old \Nman before cutting the door,
0.5;was preventing the lights from \Nturning on part of the act, too?
0.5;and there were strange marks \Nleft where the culprit entered.
0.5;Those are my footprints leading \Nfrom the veranda to the fence,
0.5;but see how a shallow semicircle of \Nsnow has been dug out next to it?
0.5;Isn't that because the culprit erased his \Nfootprints with the blade of the sickle?
0.5;Take a look. The semicircular \Ndepression ends here.
0.5;In other words, when the \Nculprit committed the crime...
0.5;He ran across the water as \Nif he was riding on the wind.
0.5;This must be some kind of trick of \Na flesh-and-blood human, of course.
0.5;It was just an idiot pretending \Nto be a kamaitachi.
0.5;But wasn't it the kamaitachi that \Ndestroyed the room we decorated?
0.5;Come to think of it, your late husband \Nplayed survival games, didn't he?
0.5;Aside from valuables, all my husband's \Npossessions are in the storehouse.
0.5;Then the culprit must have taken it from the \Nstorehouse and shot through the sliding door.
0.5;But even though there were ten balloons, \Nthey popped at nearly the same time.
0.5;Well, with enough shots, \Nyou could probably pop ten.
0.5;I don't think it was the BB \Npellets that popped the balloons.
0.5;The shards of the light bulb\Nare still on the floor.
0.5;Doesn't it smell like \Nsomeone's cooking something?
0.5;That's not food. That's the smell \Nof a bathroom or cleaning detergent.
0.5;Also, it was cold because it got \Ncovered in rainwater or something.
0.5;And the windows weren't \Neven open. Weird, right?
0.5;When the old man screamed, we were \Nall standing in front of this room.
0.5;But I'm impressed you knew it was \Nthe old man just from that scream.
0.5;I just thought it might be and asked \Nthe landlady for confirmation.
0.5;we were offering free foot \Nmassages to our guests.
0.5;But with the cameras around, \Nour guests declined,
0.5;so my father-in-law had no \Nchoice but to accept a massage.
0.5;The way he screamed in pain then \Nsounded very similar to that scream.
0.5;Yes. You should be able \Nto view it in the office.
0.5;There's something I wanted to tell you, \Nbut this kamaitachi has ruined everything.
0.5;Well, actually, the other day on the \NEbisu Bridge in Osaka, he said...
0.5;“What are you doing to\Nmy darling Kazuha?”
0.5;I might be a little off, but \Nthat's more or less what he said.
0.5;Masters say that kind of stuff all \Nthe time in historical dramas.
0.5;I don't think Hattori-kun \Nthinks you're his henchman.
0.5;By the way, did any of the guests \Nbear a grudge against the old man?
0.5;Yes. He was very hard on me, \Nthe waitstaff, and cooks.
0.5;I heard there was a head chef who \Nhe practically threw out of the inn.
0.5;I heard about it when I \Nmarried into the family.
0.5;By the way, do those two \Nwriters stay here often?
0.5;...when Kohei nearly drowned \Nin the outdoor bath.
0.5;The storehouse was first \Nbroken into that day, too.
0.5;Between taking Kohei to the hospital and \Nthe police arriving, it was total chaos.
0.5;I didn't even have time to clean \Nthe outdoor bath that day.
0.5;Though they do seem a little \Ndifferent this time.
0.5;It's been one hour and twenty-eight\Nminutes since we found the body.
0.5;If we don't solve the mystery \Nbehind the trick soon,
0.5;the snow will change the \Narea around the crime scene.
0.5;My watch is painted with luminous \Npaint that allows me to—
0.5;But since it's cold, would \Nyou like some kudzu gruel?
0.5;Yeah. Upon hearing the old man's \Nscream, we came to this outdoor bath,
0.5;which was a shortcut to the \Nannex where he was staying.
0.5;But since we had to cross the \Nbath to get to the annex,
0.5;we decided to exit the inn and come \Nback in through the back door instead.
0.5;Naturally, it was after we confirmed there \Nwere no transparent platforms in the water.
0.5;Now let's go outside and head to \Nthe annex through the back door.
0.5;No. It's cold outside, \Nand the annex is far way.
0.5;but the breakers were switched off, \Nand it was pitch black inside.
0.5;When we turned on a light, \Nwe saw the cut sliding door,
0.5;and when we entered the room, \Nwe found the murdered old man.
0.5;Doesn't it mean there's someone \Nwho could have gotten here quicker...
0.5;It was faster to come \Nthrough the outdoor bath.
0.5;Did you take off all your clothes and \Nwade butt-naked through the bath?
0.5;Th-There must be a transparent \Nplatform or something in the water.
0.5;it's in a phase between liquid and \Nsolid before it becomes kudzu gruel.
0.5;But if you apply a strong force at once, \Nit becomes rock hard like a solid.
0.5;As proof, remember how Kohei-kun \Nsaid he nearly drowned...
0.5;That's because the water \Nthen was the same as right now.
0.5;Then they met up with us \Nafter killing the old man.
0.5;That's why you switched off the annex's \Nbreakers and cut the sliding door.
0.5;...if we were distracted by the sliding \Ndoor when we turned on the flashlight.
0.5;It would take a massive amount of kudzu \Npowder to make this special water.
0.5;But what was she going to do with all the \Nkudzu powder she mixed into the water?
0.5;The water in this hot spring \Nflows directly from the source.
0.5;With enough time, it would \Nwash away on its own.
0.5;Then, the person who destroyed Kohei's \Nbirthday party decorations...
0.5;If she didn't cause a fuss to draw \Nthe cops away from the storehouse,
0.5;Kohei-kun said it smelled like a \Nbathroom or detergent, remember?
0.5;It was probably the smell \Nof lemons or something.
0.5;Maybe she put fruit juice in \Nthe water gun and shot it.
0.5;Fruit juice dissolves the \Nrubber used in balloons.
0.5;The missing water gun probably \Nbelonged to your late husband, too.
0.5;Didn't you keep it in the storehouse \Nalong with his air gun?
0.5;but before the incident, someone\Ncut my cheek in the storehouse!
0.5;And I wasn't standing near \Nthe light bulb when it broke!
0.5;Besides, couldn't anyone else have \Nperformed the trick you just described?
0.5;While deliberately bumping your head on the \Nlampshade and pretending to be annoyed.
0.5;My science teacher said if you stick \Nsomething on the surface of an old light bulb
0.5;to create a difference in temperature, \Nthey become prone to shattering.
0.5;Besides, the culprit probably used \NHeiji-niichan's luminous watch...
0.5;...and the light from Kogoro-no-ojisan's \Ncigarette to cut them in the dark.
0.5;But why were you cut when you didn't \Nhave anything that produced light?
0.5;With a box cutter blade or something \Nsimilar you have hidden under your nails.
0.5;...by pressing it to your face and \Nsmearing blood on your hands.
0.5;Besides, you created the opportunity to\Ngo to the storehouse in the first place.
0.5;You made us believe there could be\Na kamaitachi and call the police.
0.5;Then you used a water gun and air gun\Nto destroy the birthday party room,
0.5;in order to draw the police away from the\Nstorehouse where the sickle was kept.
0.5;When we gathered in front of the birthday \Nparty room, you played the old man's scream.
0.5;Yeah. She recorded the old \Nman's scream from the TV report...
0.5;...with a smartphone or something, \Nand set it to play on a timer.
0.5;To finish things off, while we were heading \Nto the annex through the back door,
0.5;and stabbed the old man \Nto death with the sickle.
0.5;Then she cut the sliding door, switched \Noff the breaker, and met up with us.
0.5;W-Wrong?! There's no evidence to \Nprove anything you're saying!
0.5;The landlady said you weren't \Nwearing glasses before.
0.5;I heard on TV that people \Nwho aren't accustomed...
0.5;...to wearing fake nails have \Ntrouble putting in contacts.
0.5;Which means normally you \Ndon't wear fake nails.
0.5;Which means it should still \Nbe stuck to your nail.
0.5;The blood from when you \Ncut me and Mori-no-occhan.
0.5;Does that mean the cook who was \Ncruelly fired by the old man was...
0.5;My mother started looking \Nfor a new job right away,
0.5;who was good friends with my mother, \Nwas offered a marriage proposal.
0.5;The girl was the only \Ndaughter of another inn.
0.5;If they got married, they could merge \Ntheir inns and expand their business.
0.5;If not for you, my mother wouldn't have \Nsuffered and died the way she did!
0.5;But when I saw how your hands were\Nchapped like my mother's, I decided not to.
0.5;Besides, I didn't want that \Nboy who nearly drowned...
0.5;...in the outdoor bath to experience \Nwhat I went through.
0.5;Does that mean you're the one who sent that \Nphoto of the kamaitachi to the magazine?
0.5;Yeah. I wanted to see if I \Nactually could walk on water,
0.5;and I thought if rumors \Nspread about the kamaitachi,
0.5;guests would stop using the outdoor bath, \Nmaking it easier for me to execute my trick.
0.5;The kamaitachi legend was\Noriginally though to come...
0.5;...from cuts on the skin\Ncreated by the vacuum...
0.5;...in the center of whirlwinds, but now the \Nestablished theory is that the sudden cooling...
0.5;...caused by the heat of vaporization causes \Nthe skin to split open and become chapped.
0.5;That's why kamaitachi legends \Nare common in snowy regions.
0.5;You said, “What are you \Ndoing to my Kazuha?” right?
0.5;I said, “You bastard, what \Nare you doing to her?”
0.5;Kudo got to confess in \Nfront of Big Ben in London.
0.5;I can't accept that I said something \Nso important on the Ebisu Bridge.
0.5;By the way, the kids in the Detective \NBoys copied that audio file.
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “The Darkness \Nof the Prefectural Police, Part One!”
0.5;The body of magazine editor \NNakatsu Kyogo-san
0.5;was found pressed face-first into \Nconcrete on Haido High School grounds.
0.5;who was found face-up in the \Nconcrete next to Nakatsu-san.
0.5;However, Kuchiki-san is claiming \Nan alien descended in a UFO,
0.5;murdered Nakatsu-san \Nwhile floating in midair,
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills \Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;They're saying the murder \Nwas committed by an alien,
0.5;and the police are hiding \Nthe existence of aliens.
0.5;we hadn't made public yet and says \Nit came from a famous detective.
0.5;I ran into him at the \Ncrime scene the other day.
0.5;Then head to his place immediately \Nand ask him what's going on!
0.5;He still seems to be obsessed \Nwith anime and manga.
0.5;You have to be careful \Nwhen talking to Mori-san.
0.5;You can't blame me for \Nwanting Mori-san's help.
0.5;I wasn't making any progress no \Nmatter how many people I questioned.
0.5;If you want to know what \Nhappened three months ago,
0.5;The man we found at the crime \Nscene suddenly changed his story.
0.5;I'm exhausted from being \Nmade to canvas the area
0.5;The dieting methods in the package I \Nreceived have been really effective.
0.5;I told my drinking buddies about \Nit half-jokingly the other day.
0.5;Tell them to take down \Nthat blog post right way.
0.5;But is it true that the man \Nat the crime scene recently
0.5;and suddenly started \Nclaiming it was an alien?
0.5;Yeah, he said he suddenly \Nremembered after three months.
0.5;He's casually written about getting arrested \Nfor trespassing in a person's yard
0.5;He said it's the police's \Nfault the UFO got away,
0.5;and that maybe they're deliberately \Nblocking him so information about aliens
0.5;If he wanted to insist it wasn't \Nhim, he would've written about it.
0.5;but everyone was at the \NHaido Festival that day.
0.5;Then what about the summer break \Nwhen Ran's friend saw the UFO?
0.5;was pushed down the stairs at \NHaido Park before summer break,
0.5;everyone had been avoiding \Nthe park out of fear.
0.5;People started returning to the \Npark after security cameras
0.5;Why don't we try going \Nto that man's house now?
0.5;If the Great Detective Kogoro solves \Nthe case after talking to him,
0.5;Could we come inside to \Ntalk to you for a minute?
0.5;Oh, he's just a kid I'm taking \Ncare of who likes UFOs.
0.5;So no one would identify his \Nunidentified flying object.
0.5;It was just the right distance, \Nso I jogged here from home.
0.5;You mean that long skinny bag we made \Nby taping black plastic bags together?
0.5;In any case, let's get everyone \Ntogether and test it out.
0.5;We already talked in my \Napartment the other day.
0.5;There weren't any footprints \Nleaving the concrete either.
0.5;Couldn't you have walked \Nbackwards out of the concrete,
0.5;What were you doing inside \Nour school's grounds,
0.5;So I brought Nakatsu-san since \Nhe's the editor of a UFO magazine.
0.5;You can see the whole area \Nfrom the roof of the school.
0.5;a cigar-shaped UFO \Nflying over Haido Park
0.5;Even if you hold the opening \Nshut, you can still breathe.
0.5;It seems like you could inflate it \Nby running around with the bag open.
0.5;There weren't any footprints \Nlike that in the concrete.
0.5;Try waving it in a sideways \Nfigure eight motion.
0.5;You can inflate the bag that \Nway without running around.
0.5;All these footprints are \Nabout the same depth.
0.5;You could hide the footprints if a \Ngiant monster stepped on them, though.
0.5;When the air inside the bag is \Nheated by the sun and inflates,
0.5;the density of the air inside \Ndecreases, so it floats.
0.5;The bag is black so it \Ngets hotter in the sun,
0.5;so the air heats up quicker \Nall the way through.
0.5;using the skinny black plastic bag \Nyou hid in the shrubbery beforehand.
0.5;You filled the bag with air using the method \Nwe just demonstrated and tied it off,
0.5;As expected, the construction \Ncrew found you
0.5;Then the long skinny shadow on \Nthe security camera footage...
0.5;It was the shadow of the solar \Nballoon he used to commit his crime.
0.5;What about the UFO I \Nsaw during summer break?
0.5;Y-You've been talking like \NI'm the one who did it,
0.5;Do you have any proof that I \Nreleased the floating black bag?
0.5;The proof's probably caught \Nin the trees at Haido Park.
0.5;You were able to collect \Nthe bag you tested with,
0.5;but security cameras were installed in \Nthe park at the end of summer break.
0.5;But since he couldn't retrieve \Nthe bag because of the cameras,
0.5;the police might gather eyewitness \Naccounts of a flying black bag,
0.5;Since there weren't any \Naccounts after three months,
0.5;Nakatsu-san's saliva and the culprit's \Nfingerprints will be on it.
0.5;I can't believe you were willing \Nto get stuck in concrete
0.5;He said that even though he's\Nthe editor of a UFO magazine!
0.5;by sticking to your guns and \Ntaken better photos of real UFOs.
0.5;Kyogoku-san was in the \NHaido High karate club.
0.5;but apparently some rich girl \Nhas been following him around.
0.5;Anyway, I'm surprised you \Nfigured out the trick he used.
0.5;and tape stuffed in a \Ncupboard at his apartment.
0.5;But how did you know he \Nwas hiding them there?
0.5;When he let us in after \Ncleaning up his apartment,
0.5;his right hand was paler \Nthan the rest of him.
0.5;That's how I knew he'd been \Nraising his right hand
0.5;I arrested a suspect who tried \Nto pin his crime on an alien.
0.5;Although I have Conan-kun \Nto thank for most of it.
0.5;I was sent a bunch of early \NValentine's Day chocolate.
0.5;They were so good, I \Ncouldn't stop eating them.
0.5;Oh, you mean the envelope containing \Nthe marriage registration.
0.5;We could head back, but \Nthe sun's about to set.
0.5;Is there someplace nearby where \Nwe could spend the night?
0.5;There's a guest house at \Nthe bottom of the mountain.
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;The secret of the tengu marks \Nthe start of a new case.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;I'm talking about the money \Nnot listed on the statement!
0.5;Sensei, do you have anything \Nyou'd like to say?
0.5;The passages are narrow, so it's for \Npeople unable to go deep inside the cave.
0.5;The mayor strung a rope on the \Nshrine and hung himself,
0.5;That place is really high \Noff the ground, though.
0.5;You used to be able to go \Nright up under the shrine.
0.5;you boys used to climb up to the \Nshrine all the time, didn't you?
0.5;he's been continuing his life's \Nwork of researching the tengu.
0.5;Is the book you published \Nabout the tengu, too?
0.5;On top of that, they threw \Nme a party last night.
0.5;Were the mayor and Imazu-san \Nyour students, too?
0.5;Until he lost to Mayama-san in \Nthe recent mayoral election,
0.5;Maybe I should tell you what I \Nwas doing in front of the cave.
0.5;but I think he was being blackmailed over off \Nthe books money he received in the election.
0.5;While I was wondering what \Nto do, I ran into you guys.
0.5;Did anyone else enter the \Ncave during that time?
0.5;it would've been easier to \Nleave the scaffolding up.
0.5;At 9 AM, without realizing \Nyou were watching him,
0.5;but when they realized Imazu-san \Nwas out front, they probably left.
0.5;There's no guarantee Imazu-san \Nis telling the truth,
0.5;But it's true that the door \Nwas locked when we arrived.
0.5;There is where we met \NShimomura-san yesterday.
0.5;He probably thought he couldn't \Nescape his blackmailer.
0.5;The Kurama tengu is a symbol \Nof chasing out evil.
0.5;Maybe that was the message he was trying \Nto convey by wearing the tengu mask.
0.5;from the blackmailer and \Nthe publishing party
0.5;but we'd just be playing \Ninto the killer's hands.
0.5;They appear on the back when the victim \Nis lying face up on the ground.
0.5;How could someone have carried \Na body all the way up there?
0.5;And there'd be no benefit \Nto doing it, either.
0.5;The spring was visible in the \Nforeground of the monitor.
0.5;Maybe it was because it was just \Nafter he had hung himself.
0.5;Mayama-san followed the \Ninstructions he received
0.5;from the blackmailer the previous \Nnight and came to the cave.
0.5;It was so they'd be free to commit \Ntheir crime for an entire hour,
0.5;until Hirai-san came at \N10 AM to unlock the door.
0.5;Then they strangled Mayama-san with \Nthe rope they prepared beforehand.
0.5;tied the rope they used to \Nstrangle Mayama-san to the post,
0.5;Next they tied a separate \Npiece of rope to their body
0.5;They probably tied the rope so it \Nwould come undone if they let go.
0.5;The ledge they fell onto \Nisn't visible on the monitor.
0.5;You'll find pieces of the \Nvictim's jacket there.
0.5;Then they replaced Mayama-san's \Njacket and pants
0.5;on his body and placed the \Ntengu mask on his face.
0.5;It occurs when the door to the \Ncave is opened and closed.
0.5;The killer must've climbed \Nthe cliff to escape.
0.5;There's actually something \Nodd about the tengu's voice.
0.5;In other words, when \NImazu-san opened the door.
0.5;I guess that would be right after \Nthe first voice you mentioned.
0.5;After all, look at how \Nnarrow that passage is.
0.5;Yesterday you had that cloth \Nhanging around your shoulders,
0.5;Is it because you're hiding \Na scratch underneath it
0.5;from when you scraped yourself \Non the uneven rocks?
0.5;His clothes are torn, but \Nhis body is unscratched.
0.5;Is the rope you used when \Nyou fell inside your backpack?
0.5;While hiking around the mountains, \NI ran into a surveyor.
0.5;he said it it was to turn this mountain \Ninto a landfill for industrial waste.
0.5;Mayama-kun had received undocumented \Ncontributions to his campaign
0.5;the town's valuable cultural \Nproperty for his own benefit.
0.5;For the town's sake,\NI had to become the tengu,
0.5;and bring the hammer of \Nrighteousness down on him.
0.5;I pretended to be a blackmailer \Nand called Mayama-kun to the cave.
0.5;I was surprised to see the \Nscaffolding had been taken down,
0.5;Hirai-kun witnessed the fall at \N10 AM, just as I had planned.
0.5;But I wasn't expecting him to bring the \Ngreat detective Mori Kogoro with him.
0.5;That was some sharp detective \Nwork, if I say so myself.
0.5;All his bragging might \Nactually make his nose grow.
0.5;Apparently they arrested the killer \Nof the murder that happened
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shooting comet!
0.5;Conan's logic can heal the\Ndried hearts of modern society!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;I should be out looking for\Nthose men in black who shrunk me.
0.5;Yes. Agasa-sama, party of three,\Ncorrect? There's no mistake.
0.5;Okay, you! Only half\Nof the cost has been paid!
0.5;Yeah, it's as good\Nas free in your case.
0.5;My scientist friends and I like\Nto communicate via PC lately.
0.5;One of them found an interesting\Ntour on an online forum
0.5;Luckily, my friend, his granddaughter,\Nand I all were chosen!
0.5;Six parties will attend--\Nten people in all, including you.
0.5;Everyone gets a\N50% hotel discount.
0.5;But the tour organizer is\None of the other seven people,
0.5;and whoever figures out\Nwho that is gets to stay for free
0.5;and wins floppy disks\Ncontaining a certain program.
0.5;So how do I look for\Nthis mysterious organizer?
0.5;We received the names and\Nroom numbers of all the attendees.
0.5;And the organizer's supposed\Nto play a certain character
0.5;That's how long you took\Nto respond to my question.
0.5;You're the one who\Nanswered in 2.86 seconds--
0.5;I never expected\Nyou would question me...
0.5;That's all right. I'll know the\Ntruth once I process this data.
0.5;You're still missing\Nsomeone's information.
0.5;W-What was that,\NKamijo-san of Room 2102?!
0.5;Add it in after my\N1.48 seconds, Konno-san.
0.5;Yeah, right.\NHe's just playin' innocent.
0.5;He shows up in lots\Nof Shinichi's dad's novels!
0.5;The Night Baron is an elusive\Nvillain created by my father, Yusaku!
0.5;He's a thief of the darkness\Nand sometimes a crazed murderer!
0.5;My father hasn't revealed\Nthe Night Baron's identity yet,
0.5;but whoever's using\Nhis name is one of them...
0.5;This makes no sense.\NI'm going to our room.
0.5;Hold on. There were\Nsupposed to be ten people.
0.5;There's only eight here,\Nus three and these five.
0.5;He's the reason\NI started practicing karate!
0.5;My name is Mori Ran!\NI won the recent city championship!
0.5;I never expected to\Nmeet you here! I'm so lucky!
0.5;Let me introduce you. This is\Nmy fiancé, Sayama Akiko-san.
0.5;Don't take it personally.\NShe gets jealous easily...
0.5;Room 1901, Maeda-san...\N0.75 seconds.
0.5;It's strange. You're supposed to\Nbe two professors and a little girl.
0.5;They couldn't come,\Nso we came in their place.
0.5;That was my father,\Nand he's a detective, not a professor.
0.5;How dirty of him to\Nsend a detective instead.
0.5;But with Mori Kogoro here,\Nwe cannot afford to show our faults.
0.5;So that's why they were shocked\Nwhen I said Dad was a detective...
0.5;If I find which of those\Nseven is the Night Baron,
0.5;we get to enjoy\NIzu Beach for free.
0.5;Ah! So that's why Professor\NAgasa told him it was free!
0.5;But of course! Because\Nthere's no mystery I can't solve!
0.5;Okay, then! I better go do\Nmy preliminary questioning!
0.5;What's wrong, Conan-kun?\NLet's move on!
0.5;I'm going to stay\Nhere a little longer.
0.5;Oh? Well, I'll be in\Nthe gift shop downstairs.
0.5;Why were they all so shocked\Nat the mention of a detective?
0.5;All you get is to\Nstay for free, so why?
0.5;...and wins floppy disks\Ncontaining a certain program.
0.5;He must've changed in the\Nrestroom and then taken the stairs.
0.5;But who dressed\Nup as the Night Baron?!
0.5;Excluding us, there are\Nseven people on this tour.
0.5;The purpose of the tour is to find\Nits organizer among the attendees.
0.5;But it's just a simple\Ngame to stay for free.
0.5;Who'd push someone\Noff just for that?!
0.5;No idea. All the ad said was\Nthat it was the 'ultimate program.'
0.5;Oh, that reminds me.\NMy professor friend mentioned
0.5;It's odd, though. He shouldn't\Nknow any more about it than I do.
0.5;What're you doing?! I've been\Nwaiting at the gift shop this whole time!
0.5;That's nothing to laugh\Nabout! What's wrong with you?!
0.5;But you don't seem hurt.\NGo change and then we'll have dinner.
0.5;Dad! And Maeda-san\Nand Sayama-san!
0.5;Your father just\Nfinished interrogating us...
0.5;"""You're the Night Baron,\Naren't you?!"" and such."
0.5;But be careful. Some dirty-minded\Nwolf might be on the prowl.
0.5;Akiko-san signed you\Nup for this mystery tour?
0.5;Yeah, she's a huge\Nfan of Kudo Yusaku's novels.
0.5;She's especially\Nfond of Night Baron ones.
0.5;You're not the only\Nexpert on the Night Baron...
0.5;I hope that's food for thought.\NNow if you'll excuse me...
0.5;Huh? That pervert\Ndidn't even glance at her!
0.5;Looks like Hayashi\NShizue-san isn't with him.
0.5;Okay! Time to\Ndo some investigating!
0.5;Say, are you after\Nthe computer virus too?
0.5;I'm Conan Edogawa from Room 1902.\NDo you remember me?
0.5;The people on the tour\Nkeep talking about a virus.
0.5;But I don't know\Nwhy they're talking about it.
0.5;There was once a mysterious\Ncomputer virus that infected
0.5;computers at large corporations\Nand ravaged all the data.
0.5;Naturally, it is an unstoppable\Nand undetectable 'perfect program.'
0.5;In fact, it was so elusive\Nthat the people named it--
0.5;Everyone who knows\Ncomputers knows its name.
0.5;I see. And the tour organizer\Nis also named the Night Baron!
0.5;So that gives some idea as to\Nthe contents of the program!
0.5;Memories of my son\Nwho died four years ago...
0.5;Be careful, Shizue-san.\NThat lad is one sharp rascal.
0.5;A hacker?! A person\Nwho steals computer data?!
0.5;It's the name of my\Nmother who died last year!
0.5;This guy's named his\NPC after his dead mother!
0.5;Do you know where the\Nperson who was sitting here went?
0.5;He went back to his\Nroom to do something.
0.5;Say, if you know him,\Ncould you return this to him?
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nhe had this around his head...
0.5;Don't give me that!\NYou're always sneaking around!
0.5;The three of them\Nwent to their rooms long ago.
0.5;Come on, you've\Nhad too much to drink!
0.5;Ran-neechan. Where\Ndid your dad go anyway?
0.5;Why would anyone\Ndivorce such a beautiful woman?!
0.5;You know who the\NNight Baron is by now, right?
0.5;I can't tell you!\NThe hotel fee is at stake here!
0.5;Oh, come on! At least a hint!\NPlease, Mr. Great Detective!
0.5;Plus I'd get bitten if\NI stay with you any longer...
0.5;The perfect computer virus,\N'Night Baron.'
0.5;With it, one could\Nthreaten banks or corporations
0.5;I'm sure lots of people\Nwould like to get it.
0.5;But what is the tour organizer\Ntrying to do by gathering such people?!
0.5;It's disturbing that the immortal\NNight Baron would perish...
0.5;Out of the fourth corner, #7 \NDarkest Nightmare is in the lead!
0.5;A thousand each on four or \Nfive races in the second half.
0.5;It was sunny when I left \Nfor the betting booth,
0.5;but it started raining \Nthe second I got there.
0.5;When I went to buy cigarettes after getting \Nmy tickets, my usual ones were sold out.
0.5;To top it all off, my \Nwallet fell into a puddle.
0.5;The tickets in my wallet \Ngot soaking wet, too.
0.5;Well, they're losing tickets, \Nso it's not like it matters.
0.5;Next up are the results \Nfrom races nine through 12.
0.5;Placing first in race nine, the Yamanaka \NSpecial, was #8 Pirate's Spirit.
0.5;That was the dark horse! \NThis pays out a hundred-fold!
0.5;Umatan tickets for #8 followed \Nby #11 win 50800 yen.
0.5;Sanrenpuku tickets for #6, \N#8, and #11 win 25400 yen.
0.5;he picked up someone else's \Nticket and put it in his wallet?
0.5;All right, tonight we're having \Nsushi for dinner, sushi!
0.5;A ten thousand yen ticket \Nyields an easy payout!
0.5;"""The Tokyo-Style Detective \NShow Next Door, Part One!"""
0.5;Just imagine you've reserved the \Nrestaurant for yourselves, sir.
0.5;One beer and three extra \Nspecials, one without wasabi.
0.5;I can't believe you bet all \Nthat money on Pirate's Spirit.
0.5;The boss said you only come \Nhere when you win at the races.
0.5;And I heard you normally only \Norder regulars or specials,
0.5;The radio said they were only selling dark \Nhorse payout tickets for Pirate's Spirit today,
0.5;I'm not the type of guy to \Nsettle down in one place.
0.5;but it's too dangerous for me \Nto use a knife with one eye.
0.5;The boss told me to handle customers \Nuntil my left eye gets better.
0.5;Come to think of it, that's \Nwhat they all said.
0.5;Either his right or left \Neye is an artificial eye.
0.5;Anyway, tell me about \Nthe cases you've solved.
0.5;I've loved mysteries \Nsince I was a little kid.
0.5;Since I heard you live next door to this \Nplace, I've been dying to meet you.
0.5;So she used the footage \Nfrom an old home video
0.5;to make it seem like the dead man \Nhad come back to life as a zombie.
0.5;You were bedridden after eating \Nsome poisonous mushrooms.
0.5;Anyway, sushi doesn't taste \Nright without wasabi.
0.5;I'll have the nigiri special, \Nsome chawanmushi...
0.5;Apparently they go together \Nsurprisingly well.
0.5;Also, do you have the limited availability \Nseasonal grilled fish today?
0.5;In that case, I'd like a \Nhighball and seafood chirashi.
0.5;Kogoro-san, come back and tell \Nme more interesting stories.
0.5;I'll take your bill out of my \Nwages and give you a discount.
0.5;You can't just come in here and \Nstart picking fights with our—
0.5;Hey, you! If you wanted to use the \Nbathroom, you should've said so!
0.5;I hurried home and used the GPS on my \Nspare phone to find it in this shop.
0.5;But none of your customers have a \Nbag they could have put my pouch in.
0.5;That's shortly before Kogoro-san \Nand his family arrived.
0.5;And since none of the customers \Nwho arrived after him have left...
0.5;If they're smart, they'll have wiped \Ntheir fingerprints off the pouch.
0.5;My hand slipped while I was peeling \Nand apple and I cut my finger.
0.5;It was bad enough that I \Nbled through the band-aid.
0.5;who stole my pouch with this \Nhand, so it should still be on them.
0.5;with my red blood that seeped \Nthrough the band-aid.
0.5;My dark horse payout ticket \Nworth a million yen!
0.5;A-A dark horse payout ticket \Nworth a million yen?
0.5;I was listening to the \Nrace results on the radio.
0.5;I was doing my best to keep \Nthem from stealing my pouch.
0.5;On top of that, she had her \Nglasses pushed up on her forehead
0.5;so she could read the \Nsmall print on her phone.
0.5;But I got a firm grip on \Nthe thief's white sleeve
0.5;with this finger that's \Nbleeding through the band-aid.
0.5;But there wasn't any \Nblood on anyone's sleeve.
0.5;Let me get a better look at \Nthe rest of your sleeve, too.
0.5;It got wet when I washed \Nmy hands in the bathroom.
0.5;Like him, it got wet when I \Nwashed my hands in the bathroom.
0.5;My sleeve's wet, but it's \Nnot from the bathroom.
0.5;It was coming down pretty \Nhard until a minute ago.
0.5;Maybe the ticket you picked \Nup belongs to that woman.
0.5;I was watching the races \Nin my office around then.
0.5;Since you were out buying tickets, \Nyou only saw the last race.
0.5;An little over an hour ago, you \Nwould've been near the ticket booth.
0.5;Maybe the thief was in a \Nrush to redeem the ticket,
0.5;And you picked it up and \Nput it in your wallet.
0.5;If you cut yourself deep enough that \Nyou bled through your band-aid,
0.5;There wasn't any blood on \Nthe ticket in my wallet.
0.5;I made sure to use my uninjured \Nright hand when touching my ticket.
0.5;Let's see which of us can \Nfind the thief first.
0.5;B-But there wasn't any \Nblood on anyone's sleeve.
0.5;I'd understand wanting to \Nwatch a sporting event live,
0.5;It's hard to imagine a young man \Ncasually ordering the special
0.5;at a sushi restaurant doesn't \Nhave a DVD or Blu-ray recorder.
0.5;I'm meeting my wife's parents \Nfor a drink tonight.
0.5;I got involved in an incident \Nat a sushi restaurant.
0.5;A drunk tried to pick a \Nfight with your husband.
0.5;He tripped, and his clothes \Ngot soaked in the rain.
0.5;We're drying his clothes at \Nthe restaurant right now.
0.5;Then could you tell him \Nwe'll be waiting for him
0.5;I don't mind playing along \Nwith this charade for a while.
0.5;I'm the highest bid right now, \Nbut it's a popular painting.
0.5;If I'm not careful, someone \Nelse will outbid me.
0.5;Then you could easily make it \Nin time if you left by nine.
0.5;But it's running out of battery, \Nso I need to charge it.
0.5;It's strange that that woman's \Nblood wasn't on anyone's sleeve.
0.5;But why did the thief leave the \Nstolen pouch in the bathroom?
0.5;and left the incriminating \Nwallet in a nearby trashcan.
0.5;The person who has either \Na million yen in cash
0.5;or the stolen dark horse \Nticket on them is the thief.
0.5;The thief's already a \Ncarp on a cutting board.
0.5;All that's left is for me to name \Nthem and for them to confess.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is "" The Tokyo-Style \NDetective Show Next Door, Part Two!"""
0.5;With the meal tickets Professor \NAgasa won in a lottery,
0.5;we came to a high class \Nrestaurant on the top floor
0.5;However, the restaurant's \Nchef was gravely injured
0.5;when he was stabbed in \Nthe stomach by someone.
0.5;who were scattered throughout \Nthe department store,
0.5;and instructed them to look \Nfor the culprit, but...
0.5;That leaves the testimony of the three \Nkids who say they saw the culprit.
0.5;but they say they remember the culprit's \Ndistinguishing characteristics.
0.5;They had the number 2 on their \Nclothes, which were gray.
0.5;It was the same color as \Nwhat Haibara's wearing.
0.5;They were average height, just a \Nlittle taller than the professor.
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;these mannequins were near \Nthe fifth floor stairs.
0.5;I just remembered I saw \Nthe culprit slip between
0.5;the mannequins as they \Nheaded down the stairs!
0.5;We're holding a children's uniform \Nfair in the sporting goods area,
0.5;so we're moving the mannequins \Nto the seventh floor
0.5;The fifth floor used to be a toy store \Nthat sold children's clothes, too.
0.5;Even though the service \Nelevator is being inspected,
0.5;Then can't we determine the \Nculprit's approximate height
0.5;It looked like something had been \Npasted to the front at one point,
0.5;In any case, let's hurry to the \Ntoy store on the fourth floor.
0.5;That employee could be our \Nmost reliable witness.
0.5;You're talking about when I took \Nthis girl to the stairs, right?
0.5;I was running, so my contacts \Nslipped out of place.
0.5;near the stairs for the \Nculprit to come down.
0.5;they were back lit by the window \Nand appeared as a silhouette.
0.5;But it looked like the culprit stopped \Nin front of the window for a little bit.
0.5;It looked like they were removing something \Nstuck to the bottom of their left shoe.
0.5;they probably already \Nthrew it away somewhere.
0.5;The culprit came down the \Nstairs after that, right?
0.5;I tried, but a bunch of \Nmiddle or high school boys
0.5;a group of high school students on \Na school trip came to buy souvenirs.
0.5;They reminded me of the high \Nschool cheerleader I liked.
0.5;In my case, even flirty students \Nwould cover up with stand-up collars,
0.5;Then those students must've \Nseen the culprit, too.
0.5;We found the helium gas can the \Nculprit used to change their voice
0.5;when they called the victim's \Nrestaurant in the shrubbery
0.5;next to a phone booth \Nnear the department store.
0.5;of the department store \Nusing the payphone,
0.5;they hurried to the stairs \Nnext to the restaurant,
0.5;stabbed Hosogoe-san when he came \Nto deal with the complaint,
0.5;Forensics is examining the \Nphone booth and can right now.
0.5;But since the culprit's fingerprints \Nweren't on the knife,
0.5;we're not expecting to \Nfind them there either.
0.5;Which means we'll have to wait until \Nthe victim regains consciousness.
0.5;The suspects who attempted \Nto flee the department store
0.5;and has a brooch resembling \Nthe number 6 on her chest.
0.5;with the Tokyo Spirits logo \Nprinted on the back.
0.5;But your testimonies were \Nall over the place.
0.5;Then you'll realize their \Ninconsistent testimonies
0.5;We'll start at the seventh floor \Nstairs where the sporting goods are.
0.5;Genta, you saw the culprit running \Ndown the stairs here, right?
0.5;The basketball players that were \Nwith Genta when he saw the culprit.
0.5;Genta, could you describe \Nthe culprit you saw again?
0.5;They were on the smaller \Nside, wearing clothes
0.5;the same gray as Haibara, and had \Nthe number 2 on their clothes.
0.5;Detective Chiba, could you go \Nstand by the basketball players?
0.5;Detective Chiba is a little \Nchubby and average height,
0.5;When he's surrounded by the \Ntall basketball players,
0.5;is influenced by the size of \Nthe objects surrounding it.
0.5;Even if they're the same size, \Nthey look like different sizes.
0.5;Detective Chiba, could you hold Haibara \Nand hide behind the basketball players?
0.5;The buttons on Ai-chan's clothes \Nlook like the number three.
0.5;The basketball uniforms and \NHaibara's clothes are both gray,
0.5;and the area is full of numbers, \Nwhich is why it looks that way.
0.5;Next are the fifth floor stairs by the \Ncamera shop where Mitsuhiko saw the culprit.
0.5;This time the area's full \Nof mannequin children.
0.5;We asked a department store \Nemployee to put them back
0.5;where they were when \NMitsuhiko saw the culprit.
0.5;Mitsuhiko, what did the \Nculprit you saw look like?
0.5;They were a rather large person wearing \Ndark gray clothes with a masculine run.
0.5;Detective Chiba, could you \Nstand next to the mannequins?
0.5;Since this is the opposite \Nof the last scenario,
0.5;I know I look like a larger person when \NI'm standing in the middle of them.
0.5;Haibara, could you stand in front \Nof the short sign over there?
0.5;The mannequins and signs \Nare a bright white color,
0.5;Just like the sizes of objects, colors are \Nalso influenced by their surrounding colors.
0.5;So the clothes Mitsuhiko-kun saw \Nmight've been a darker gray.
0.5;After receiving my message, \Nan employee brought you here,
0.5;where you waited for the culprit \Nto come down the stairs, right?
0.5;so I know they were wearing \Nlight gray clothes
0.5;colors look lighter when they're \Nsurrounded by a dark black.
0.5;wearing their uniforms, so I asked \Nthe basketball players for help.
0.5;I told them we're looking for \Nthe person who stabbed someone,
0.5;and to tell their male friends \Nwearing uniforms to come here.
0.5;that their size was influenced \Nby their surroundings,
0.5;the number 2 that was mistakenly seen \Nbecause of the colors and numbers,
0.5;and the uncertain testimony claiming \Nthe culprit just seemed like a woman
0.5;than the professor wearing \Nclothes the same gray
0.5;Why are you accusing me based on \Nthe vague testimony of those kids?
0.5;There are three certain \Nfacts among their testimony.
0.5;The culprit was slightly \Ntaller than the professor,
0.5;Mister, there's something on \Nthe bottom of your left foot.
0.5;I stepped on it somewhere \Nin the department store.
0.5;When something's stuck to \Nthe bottom of his left foot,
0.5;Unlike women, men's hips don't \Nbend outward very easily.
0.5;That's why you raised \Nyour left foot behind you,
0.5;and forced yourself to remove \Nit with your left hand.
0.5;Ayumi-chan saw your back lit \Nsilhouette doing that,
0.5;Then we'll see the number \Nthat identifies the culprit.
0.5;was covered by the backpack \Nand looked like a 2.
0.5;In other words, your testimonies \Nwere all accurate.
0.5;We found saliva on the intake \Nof the helium gas can.
0.5;you'll be able to provide a \Nplausible explanation, won't you?
0.5;For why you were changing \Nyour voice at a payphone
0.5;near this department store and who \Nand why you were calling them.
0.5;I thought he'd know who I was \Nif I didn't change my voice.
0.5;The other day, I invited my girlfriend \Nto eat at that restaurant.
0.5;I didn't tell her I worked \Nthere until two years ago.
0.5;I can't believe you knew of such \Na high class place, Takashi.
0.5;Since I dyed my hair black \Nand shaved my beard,
0.5;I called the chef over thinking \Nhe wouldn't recognize me.
0.5;The secret ingredient in this \Nmarinade is honey, isn't it?
0.5;What kind of jam is an \Nindustry secret, though.
0.5;Yes, previously I used honey to \Ntone down the sourness, but...
0.5;Huh? Are you our former \Nemployee Kamaya-kun?
0.5;Because of him, my girlfriend \Nbecame disenchanted with me,
0.5;I just wanted to scare him by \Nthreatening him with a knife!
0.5;The hospital just called to say \Nthat he's regained consciousness.
0.5;I haven't given up on a new \NFusae brand clutch either.
0.5;I thought I got all of \Nit off in the bathroom.
0.5;You can't see outside \Nbecause of all the zombies.
0.5;while carrying an injured \Nman are practically zero.
0.5;you'll be able to survive using \Nthe Zombie Blade you wield.

0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""A Cottage Surrounded \NBy Zombies, Part One!"""
0.5;I took you out for a drive \Nsince you seemed bored,
0.5;Thanks to you, I couldn't \Nsleep until morning.
0.5;But they wouldn't play it on TV \Neven though Yoko-chan was in it.
0.5;The doctor said you have \Ntoo much visceral fat.
0.5;the cottage from the zombie \Nmovie we watched last night?
0.5;of fans visiting locations \Nused in movies and TV shows?
0.5;Yeah, but usually they visit \Nplaces from memorable—
0.5;This is the front door where \NYoko-chan coughed up blood!
0.5;That's the window Yoko-chan \Nkicked a zombie out of!
0.5;Doesn't this forest seem like there \Ncould actually be zombies out there?
0.5;They're obviously here \Non a pilgrimage like me.
0.5;It's true that we're here \Non related business, though.
0.5;Some idiot couple came here \Non their own pilgrimage.
0.5;They thought it was an animal \Nand got out of the car to check.
0.5;But when they opened the door, \Nthey smelled rotting flesh.
0.5;And when they went to look under \Nthe car, it crawled out...
0.5;They fled in their car and told \Ntheir friend Otaki-han about it.
0.5;Though it was probably \Njust some idiot's prank.
0.5;Besides, Zombie Blade: \NDinner Party of the Dead,
0.5;the movie we watched last \Nnight, has a cult following.
0.5;I'm not sure they'll be \Nable to make it though.
0.5;does that mean you've got a ton of \Ncrew packed into the back of your car?
0.5;so she appeared in the first one \Nfor the sake of our friendship.
0.5;Does he think I'm not good \Nenough to star in the movie?
0.5;You mean that woman who's in \Nall those suspense thrillers?
0.5;but her agency wouldn't \Ngive us the green light.
0.5;So I convinced my friend \Nto star in this C-movie.
0.5;Especially the scene in which you're bitten \Nby a zombie and become one yourself.
0.5;This movie is about Okino Yoko-san's character,\NHongo Yoko's cousin Kazami Reina,
0.5;inheriting the Zombie Blade from \Nher and exterminating zombies.
0.5;I'll be announcing it later, so \Nyou can look forward to that.
0.5;He's the president of \Nour college horror club.
0.5;You must've gotten bit by \Nsome kind of weird bug then.
0.5;Apparently they taste good, \Nbut they're poisonous.
0.5;It's rare for anyone to die \Nfrom eating tsukiyotake.
0.5;We could take him to the hospital \Non the motorcycle we rode here,
0.5;but I doubt he'd be able to hold \Nonto me until we got there.
0.5;why don't we ask the crew to give \Nhim a ride to the hospital later?
0.5;They said we could watch \Nthem film if we're quiet.
0.5;Th-This is the magical sword that turns \Nzombies to ash at the slightest touch.
0.5;Ninomiya-kun, will you get \Nour food from the car?
0.5;Normally he sticks around \Nto complain about the shoot.
0.5;When you're around, I feel \Nlike I'm in college again.
0.5;It would be perfect if \Nthe president were here.
0.5;Well, the president's brother \Nis here filming instead.
0.5;A body's jaw stiffens first, \Nbut his was still soft.
0.5;He had death spots, too, \Nbut they hadn't merged yet.
0.5;Which means it's been between \Nthirty to sixty minutes since he died.
0.5;In Kansai, I'm fairly well-known as \Nthe High School Detective of the West.
0.5;Of the West? Does that mean there's \Na High School Detective of the East?
0.5;...knows high school student \NKudo Shinichi real well.
0.5;Is it possible someone \Nmade him take the poison?
0.5;Apparently he propped up the phone on \Nthe floor with a box of cigarettes.
0.5;The timer was set to automatically \Nstart recording after a while.
0.5;and drops the bottle of \Npoison and plastic bottle.
0.5;he loses balance in front \Nof the phone on the floor.
0.5;but then he reaches out for the \Nphone that's recording him.
0.5;After about 50 minutes, you can \Nhear our voices in the background.
0.5;Which means the estimated time of death \NI gave earlier was more or less right.
0.5;Since we're always getting \Ninvolved in cases together,
0.5;he picked up my mannerisms \Nwithout realizing it.
0.5;He still hasn't forgotten about the \Nrecording of his confession to Kazuha-chan.
0.5;that sounded like a \Nsuicide note on his phone.
0.5;"I shall invite the living in \Nthis house to join our world."""
0.5;inside the envelope in \NHarawaki-san's pants pocket.
0.5;He'd always choose it himself, \Nseal it in a white envelope,
0.5;Once Ninomiya-kun accidentally \Nopened an envelope.
0.5;Harawaki-kun was furious and went through \Nthe trouble of changing the subtitle.
0.5;And there weren't any signs that the \Nenvelope had been ripped or wet.
0.5;Anyway, I'm more interested in the Naito \NJoji he mentioned at the beginning.
0.5;We told you about him before \Nwe entered the cottage.
0.5;He was the president of \Nour college horror club.
0.5;We were staying here to film a horror \Nmovie for our school festival.
0.5;But our director and club \Npresident suddenly announced...
0.5;Why don't we make this a mystery \Ninstead of a horror film?
0.5;If it's not going to be that impressive \Nanyway since it's an amateur film,
0.5;A-And we have to return the equipment \Nwe borrowed from your brother.
0.5;Aren't you the one who suggested \Nwe shoot a zombie movie?
0.5;The twist will be that the \Nreal murderer isn't a zombie,
0.5;Like a corpse that's returned \Nto life as a zombie.
0.5;but they often made sense \Nonce he explained them.
0.5;If he was so convinced he could \Ndo it, we wanted to see him do it.
0.5;so Ninomiya-kun and I \Nkept watch at the window.
0.5;Harawaki-kun, Kyoko, and I \Nstood in front of the door.
0.5;When we entered the room after \Nten minutes, he really was gone!
0.5;to see if there was a secret passageway \Nleading to the next room behind it.
0.5;We thought he might've escaped \Nthrough the window
0.5;while Ria and Ninomiya-kun were \Ncoming around the cottage.
0.5;So we ditched the president \Nand went into town to drink.
0.5;Then Ria caught a cold and \Nwas down for three days.
0.5;On the day of the fourth morning, \Nwhen we returned to the cottage...
0.5;"His head was turned slightly as though he \Nwas saying, ""You finally found me."""
0.5;they turned into a zombie \Nand vanished from the room!
0.5;Apparently lots of zombies \Nare in the next episode.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Yes. We're certain he robbed \Na bank and fired a gun.
0.5;It's also a fact that when \Nyou determined his location,
0.5;He must've either hid it or \Nthrown it away somewhere.
0.5;They didn't find a gun when \Nthey searched the area
0.5;Because he had that experience when \Nhe already had a fear of heights,
0.5;Dad, didn't the doctor \Nsay you shouldn't drink?
0.5;If you're innocent, the \Ncourthouse is the real scam.
0.5;Defendant Sakaki Taizo has \Njust been released on bail.
0.5;He will later stand trial \Nfor fraud charges that...
0.5;It's a serious wound that will \Ntake a full month to heal.
0.5;As long as I don't go \Nanywhere high, I'm fine.
0.5;and the man who was shot have \Nanything to do with each other?
0.5;The gun ended up in the current \Nsuspect's hands by total coincidence.
0.5;Did you see anyone suspicious \Nwhile you were chasing the robber?
0.5;But she always comes out \Nof that apartment building.
0.5;Hey, I told you to go home \Nsince it's too dangerous.
0.5;Unbelievably, she was once a candidate \Nfor the Olympic shooting team.
0.5;Her motive was her father \Nwhose factory went bankrupt
0.5;after he invested a large sum of \Nmoney in the Sakaki Group's futures.
0.5;and will soon be arrested \Non fraud charges as well.
0.5;Did anyone ask you about \Nyour schedules today?
0.5;I believe they said it was \Na young woman's voice.
0.5;You want to be our bodyguard since \Nsomeone's trying to kill us?
0.5;If the suspect shows up, \Nwe won't let her escape.
0.5;The police didn't know she was \Nalso trying to kill these two then.
0.5;She wanted to pick off \Nthe major target first.
0.5;In the first place, she hasn't \Neven finished him off yet.
0.5;Would she really let the unexpected \Nremain the unexpected?
0.5;In other words, the suspect asked \Nabout their schedules to mislead us.
0.5;While we're distracted, she's going \Nto finish off her primary target.
0.5;I finally understand why you \Ndidn't try to kill those two.
0.5;But at the bottom of your \Nheart, you still had doubts.
0.5;That's why you picked up the gun \Nthe robber happened to drop.
0.5;But two days later, when you learned \NSakaki was to be released on bail,
0.5;Izumi-san, are you sure you didn't have some \Nkind of personal relationship with this man?
0.5;They trusted him because he \Nwas dating their daughter.
0.5;but I'm responsible for \Nletting you pick it up.
0.5;So if you're going to \Nshoot someone, shoot me.
0.5;Later, Kisaki-sensei agreed \Nto represent Izumi-san.
0.5;New evidence of the fraud \Ngroup's crimes was found,
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NMan Who Died Twice, Part One!"""
0.5;If you hadn't tagged along, this \Nwould've been the best drive ever.
0.5;She asked me to make sure \Nyou didn't cut loose too much.
0.5;You were unusually helpful \Nfor once during her case.
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;She'd been mentioning all the time \Nsince then that she wanted to die.
0.5;On top of the landlady and \NNakanishi Kei-san's testimony,
0.5;The signature even matched the lease she \Nsigned when she moved into the apartment.
0.5;But concerning her neighbor's \Ndeath, Kei-san said...
0.5;She's the one who made the final \Ndecision to commit suicide.
0.5;Right now I'm helping out at the resort \Ninn operated by my uncle and his wife.
0.5;It's a great place with \Nmountains and beaches.
0.5;If you're ever in the area, \NI hope you'll stop by.
0.5;What's going on? There \Nwasn't any traffic before.
0.5;But, Kei-san, why did Kirisaki-san's \Nsuicide bother you so much?
0.5;About a week later, I \Nreturned to the apartment.
0.5;I had been planning to move \Nsince before the incident.
0.5;She was surprised to see you\Ncome out of Kirisaki-san's room.
0.5;Since they were used to coming and going \Nfrom each other's rooms, it's no surprise.
0.5;It's only natural you were shocked \Nby Kirisaki-san's suicide.
0.5;But why did Kirisaki Remi-san \Nwant to kill herself?
0.5;The day after the article on her \Nsuicide appeared in the paper,
0.5;So this is where that debt-avoiding \Nwoman fled to this time?
0.5;In other words, she killed \Nherself because she was tired
0.5;Since two years ago, she'd \Nbeen using a fake names.
0.5;And even though that brassy woman \Nwouldn't pay off her debts,
0.5;Then why did she use her real \Nname to rent that apartment?
0.5;"And mister, ""brassy"" doesn't \Nmatch the description"
0.5;The relatives the police called confirmed \Nit was her and took the body.
0.5;You'll get out of the car without \Nany resistance, won't you?
0.5;You were mistaken for a \Nrobber, and even the sky...
0.5;It's because we were talking \Nabout that apartment.
0.5;Normally, you rent an apartment \Nthrough a real estate agent.
0.5;But Kirisaki Remi asked\Nthe landlady directly.
0.5;"""If you're going to kill \Nyourself, do it here."""
0.5;but she had planned to \Nreturn after three months.
0.5;My uncle is postponing the opening \Nof his resort inn by three months.
0.5;You wouldn't have a job \Nif you went home now.
0.5;It's fine if you want to stay \Nhere for three more months.
0.5;Oh, someone new is moving in \Nnext door to you tomorrow.
0.5;Kirisaki Remi moved in and killed \Nherself three months later.
0.5;In other words, if things had gone \Naccording to her original plan,
0.5;The apartment stopped Kei-san to inflict \Nthat painful experience on her.
0.5;Why do they have to have this \Nthing way out in the boonies?
0.5;This really is turning\Ninto the best drive ever.
0.5;That's not what I meant. \NI mean her appearance.
0.5;Are you sure we should've \Nleft Conan-kun alone?
0.5;The next stop is my number \None recommendation.
0.5;Sorry again for the trouble we caused, \Nbut we managed to catch him.
0.5;In any case, let's head to the \Nfinish line at Shikabanezaki.
0.5;Kirisaki Remi-san moved in next door \Njust after you delayed your plans
0.5;And she didn't find the place \Nthrough a real estate agent.
0.5;And she'd been using fake \Nnames for two years,
0.5;so why did she rent the \Napartment under her real name?
0.5;they knew she had written \Nthe suicide note, too.
0.5;Since her relatives confirmed \Nthe identity of the body,
0.5;Since Kei-san came out of \NKirisaki-san's room during the fire,
0.5;we know Kei-san was coming and \Ngoing from Kirisaki-san's room.
0.5;But with the exception of \Ntheir hairstyles and glasses,
0.5;why you delayed your plans to \Ncome back here by three months.
0.5;Her uncle delayed his plans \Nto open the resort inn, so—
0.5;on the day of their silver \Nanniversary, and they did just that.
0.5;Which means Kei-san \Ndelayed her return here
0.5;I had no idea Nakanishi-san \Nand Kirisaki-san were friends.
0.5;After all, I had never \Nseen them together before.
0.5;next to yours was definitely \NKirisaki Remi-san.
0.5;When I visited his apartment that \Nday, he was collapsed on the floor.
0.5;the ambulance couldn't \Nmake it to his apartment.
0.5;I heard it was too late by the \Ntime the ambulance arrived.
0.5;But I still thought he may have been \Nsaved if that car hadn't been there.
0.5;It was three days before I \Nwas going to move back here.
0.5;She used fake names because she \Nwas engaged in some shady business.
0.5;You knew then that you couldn't \Nleave Tokyo like that.
0.5;First you had to get revenge \Nfor three years earlier.
0.5;to get away with murder was \Nto make it look like a suicide.
0.5;Oh, someone new is moving in \Nnext door to you tomorrow.
0.5;Within one apartment, you played both \NNakanishi Kei and Kirisaki Remi.
0.5;You began dropping hints so they \Nwould think it's a suicide.
0.5;...had removed your disguise and were \Nabout to return to your room.
0.5;You're using a fake name, but \Nyou're Kirisaki Remi-san, right?
0.5;You created an excuse to secretly bring \Nher to the neighboring apartment.
0.5;You made it look like a suicide \Nand left a suicide note.
0.5;You probably called the \Nlandlord of the apartment
0.5;she lived in and asked them \Nto dispose of her belongings,
0.5;It may have set today, \Nbut it will rise tomorrow.

0.5;That's dumb! The son is a fake!\NIt's the wife of the murdered man!
0.5;How would he know?\NKids don't know anything!
0.5;The Detective Samonji\Nseries is always being remade,

0.5;Come on! Turn it back!\NIt's going to end!
0.5;Things sure are peaceful for\Nfather and daughter to argue over this...

0.5;Besides, the original\Nseries ended long ago.
0.5;It's annoying that\Nthey keep putting it on TV.
0.5;"""Shinmei Nintaro's highly\Nanticipated 'Detective Samonji' returns!"""
0.5;He and a killer disappeared\Ninto a fire ten years ago,
0.5;That's what Shinichi-niichan\Nsaid on the phone the other day...
0.5;Oh? I think someone's\Nat your office downstairs...
0.5;But I really do need to talk\Nto Detective Mori about something.
0.5;It's rather late, so could\Nyou come back tomorrow?
0.5;Sorry to keep you waiting!\NI am Mori Kogoro!
0.5;What's with that attitude?\NYou told me to turn her away!
0.5;Now, then.\NMay I ask what brings you here?
0.5;You're the daughter\Nof that great master?!
0.5;I can never get enough of\NSamonji's haikus!
0.5;So, how can I help you?\NDoes he want to use me in a novel?
0.5;No, actually... my father\Nhas been missing for two months.
0.5;But it's the truth! He and my mother\Ndisappeared from their home!
0.5;They both vanished about one\Nweek before this serialization began.
0.5;I checked with all our relatives\Nand acquaintances of course,
0.5;Still, don't his serials mean\Nthat he is writing manuscripts?
0.5;Oddly enough, the manuscripts\Nare faxed to the editing department.
0.5;But don't the faxes have the\Nsender's phone number or anything?
0.5;It seems the sender has it configured\Nnot to display those things.
0.5;and he sends the faxes\Nfrom the hotel they're staying at!
0.5;But they've never been\Nquiet for two months like this before!
0.5;I asked them to investigate,\Nbut there had been no ransom calls
0.5;and the manuscripts were\Nbeing sent, so they said not to worry.
0.5;I tried the other detective agencies,\Nbut they all said the same thing.
0.5;Let's check the editing department\Nwhere his manuscripts get sent!
0.5;You can save your\Ntroubles for after that!
0.5;More should be sent today,\Nat any time now...
0.5;Are these manuscripts\Nreally written by him?
0.5;He signs his name next\Nto the title each time, too.
0.5;I can show you the faxed\Nmanuscripts, if you'd like.
0.5;Yes. We confirmed it\Nwhen I came here earlier.
0.5;There's nothing\Nto worry about, Kaori-san!
0.5;I'm sure he's just so focused\Non writing that he forgot to contact you.
0.5;The same thing happens\Nto lots of other writers!
0.5;But are you sure he forgot?\NHis wife's with him...
0.5;You know, like during\Na meeting or something.
0.5;Anything at all?\NEven the tiniest thing might help...
0.5;I suppose there is the fact he\Nrestarted his Detective Samonji series.
0.5;You see, I have been asking him\Nto restart this series for the past four years.
0.5;Samonji is dead.\NThere's no bringing him back.
0.5;So I had half given up when\Nhe suddenly called two months ago
0.5;to ask if we could make\Nroom for his new Samonji series.
0.5;We were more than\Nhappy to oblige, of course,
0.5;so we hurriedly canceled\Nthe new series we were running
0.5;Oh, come to think of it,\Nthis doesn't pertain to him exactly,
0.5;"""Attention, all master\Ndetectives throughout Japan!"
0.5;"If you wish to surpass my intellect,\Nsolve this case's true mystery."""
0.5;Yes. And ever since the\Nfirst chapter, we've received
0.5;"tons of calls and fan letters saying,\N""This is how it was done!"""
0.5;Though, fans have been waiting\Nlike crazy for over ten years,
0.5;so it's only natural he's\Ngetting such a big reception.
0.5;Yes, there was even a scary\Ncall last year from a crazed fan
0.5;who threatened to set this place\Non fire if he didn't restart the series!
0.5;Oh, yes! There's one\Nother thing that seemed strange!
0.5;Shinmei-sensei appears in the story,\Nas an old friend of Samonji's!
0.5;He's a struggling\Nwriter who resides in France.
0.5;There are about forty stories in\Nthe series, but this is a first!
0.5;I think it's going to end\Nwith all the previous cases
0.5;Kind of like how\NWatson is to Sherlock Holmes!
0.5;when Samonji calls a friend living\Nin France for advice on a case.
0.5;10:00 is written in kanji here,\Nbut 1:00 is written with a number!
0.5;We wanted to fix it to\Nmake it easier to read, too!
0.5;"But he said, ""The lay of the letters\Nis a novel's life! Don't change it!"""
0.5;He also said he'd cancel the\Nseries immediately if we defied his wish.
0.5;It's almost as if something\Nis being hidden in the writing.
0.5;And then there are\NShinmei-sensei's signatures.
0.5;If my theory is correct,\Nit's possible that he's already...
0.5;It's a mystery story!\NWait until it's in book form to read it!
0.5;Chapters one through six are all\Nslightly different, though. I wonder why!
0.5;Because he didn't\Nwant to write it anymore...
0.5;that means Shinmei-sensei\Nmight already be dead, doesn't it?
0.5;It's not 100% yet!\NThere's a chance he's still alive!
0.5;The key to saving his life is\Nprobably hidden inside this novel!
0.5;Shinmei Nintaro,\Nher father and a mystery writer,
0.5;I can only think they got\Ncaught up in some sort of incident!
0.5;Even so, his manuscripts are\Nbeing faxed here every single week.
0.5;his daughter and the editors\Nall agree it's his writing!
0.5;And like I said, those\Nfaxes are the issue here!
0.5;Don't those signatures\Nseem strange to you?!
0.5;Signatures? But they were\Nalready confirmed to be his.
0.5;Between Chapter one and six,\Nhis signatures are all slightly different,
0.5;but between Chapter six and eight,\Nthey're all exactly the same!
0.5;They're obviously copies\Nof a previous signature
0.5;and evidence that he's now in\Na condition in which he can't write!
0.5;Then tell me...\NWho did what to Mr. Shinmei?
0.5;I'd believe you more if there\Nwas a threatening phone call,
0.5;Besides, maybe he got sick of\Nsigning them and used copies instead.
0.5;True. Given the circumstances,\NInspector Megure is right.
0.5;It wouldn't be surprising\Nfor an eccentric writer
0.5;to take his wife and hole up\Nsomewhere to focus on his writing.
0.5;Then, there's the fact the writer\Nsuddenly appears in the series.
0.5;that mixes numbers, kanji\Nnumbers, and English letters...
0.5;Mr. Shinmei makes\Nfour appearances so far?
0.5;calls Mr. Shinmei,\Nwho is residing in France.
0.5;Damn! Reading them backwards\Nor rearranging them doesn't work!
0.5;It's the title of the work\Nyou're reading right now!
0.5;There's a message from\NShinmei-sensei hidden in these lines!
0.5;Which makes it all fit:\Nthat provocative dedication,
0.5;Look at this manuscript!\NThere's more dialogue!
0.5;Huh? This is the eighth\Nchapter that was just faxed here?
0.5;"""The Mystery Writer\NDisappearance Case (Part 2)."""
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut the world is even more so!
0.5;Today is finally Masked Yaiba!\NInside the costume is an incident!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Yeah, I'm meeting them\Nin front of this shrine at 6:00.
0.5;No, I think a good curry\Nrestaurant opened up near here.
0.5;Does this mean they're\Nfilming Masked Yaiba at this shrine?!
0.5;This gun is important for\Nfighting monsters, so only I can touch it.
0.5;Oh, but call your moms first,\Nso they won't worry!
0.5;"What kind of parents are they,\Nall saying, ""That would be great!""?!"
0.5;First the Laser Police, and now\NMasked Yaiba? What's with today?
0.5;Oh! Aren't you Mori Kogoro-san,\Nthe great detective?!
0.5;Wow! This is incredible!\NI'm a big fan! Let me shake your hand!
0.5;Yes, the real one\Nlooks a lot more handsome.
0.5;Now I won't have\Nto pay for their food!
0.5;You're invited too, Mori-san!\NThere'll be beer, too!
0.5;Even Monkeyshroom\Nand Pork-n-Bones are here!
0.5;This is our club's president,\NSaotome Madoka-san. This is her house.
0.5;I can recount my humble exploits\Nanytime you want, day or night!
0.5;Do you know who\Nshe's dressed up as?
0.5;Have you ever watched\NMasked Yaiba, Mori-san?
0.5;I'd really like to, but I'm so\Nbusy with work that time of day...
0.5;Masked Yaiba is really a young\Nman who sells hot dogs at the park
0.5;with Natsume Rei,\Nhis childhood friend!
0.5;Each time an incident occurs,\Nhe rushes there on his motorcycle
0.5;But Natsume Rei doesn't\Nknow his secret identity!
0.5;So he's always ditching work\Nto rush off on his motorcycle!
0.5;Even so, Natsume Rei\Nforgives him with gentle feelings!
0.5;For some reason,\NI somehow know how that feels...
0.5;Okay, everyone! Let's go to\Nthe tables! We have some juice!
0.5;He's that other guy. I guess\Nhe is a member of the fan club.
0.5;What a shock. You've only ever\Ndressed as Masked Yaiba before.
0.5;Oh, yeah! This is Mori Kogoro-san,\Nthe famous detective!
0.5;He's Honda Osamu. He's in his\Nthird year of engineering at Jonan U.
0.5;but he's a very\Npassionate Masked Yaiba fan!
0.5;That gun wouldn't\Nhappen to be real, would it?
0.5;I bet it's well-made!\NHe's a real gun fanatic!
0.5;The bullets are all blanks.\NThe barrel is plugged too, of course.
0.5;Mori-san! Won't you\Ncome and tell us a story?
0.5;Come to think of it, he kept the\Ngun away from his head when he shot.
0.5;The deceased is\NMishima Katsuji-san, age 21.
0.5;A third year student at Toto U.'s\Nphysical education department.
0.5;The Laser Police always wear\Nthese vests when fighting monsters,
0.5;so I bought one\Nfrom a security store.
0.5;Mishima-san then\Nshot himself in the head?
0.5;Honda-kun and Mishima-kun \Nwere actually very good friends.
0.5;About ten days ago,\Nwhen we had gathered to plan this party,
0.5;Mishima-kun got mad at an\Noff-hand comment by Honda-kun
0.5;That's absurd! Nobody would\Nbe driven to murder because of that!
0.5;He spent half a year\Nremodeling a normal motorcycle
0.5;So I can understand why making\Nfun of it would make him mad.
0.5;I guess that's the\Nonly way to explain it.
0.5;His explanation seems truthful enough.\NBut something bugs me!
0.5;There's something\Nabout this incident!
0.5;Inspector Megure.\NThe gun was a modified model gun.
0.5;The bullet in the bulletproof\Nvest was also made by hand.
0.5;Was Mishima-san \Nknowledgeable about guns at all?
0.5;He once asked me the difference\Nbetween automatics and revolvers.
0.5;Come to think of it, do all\NMasked Yaiba members...?
0.5;Hey, what characters\Nin Masked Yaiba carry guns?
0.5;Conan-kun! Masked Yaiba\Nhas no need for guns!
0.5;Still, that leaves\Ntoo many things unclear...
0.5;It sure is shocking to see\Nsomething like this happen, though.
0.5;That's for sure. I guess TV dramas\Naren't entirely fiction after all.
0.5;If my theory is correct,\Nit solves all the mysteries.
0.5;Damn... Committing\Na murder right in front of me...
0.5;Genta! Let me borrow your\NDetective League badge for a minute!
0.5;Inspector, I'd like to\Ntake Honda to the hospital...
0.5;Even with the bulletproof vest on,\Nhe was shot from close range.
0.5;He could have a cracked rib.\NLet's drive him there right away.
0.5;Please wait until later\Nto take him to the hospital.
0.5;Allow me to solve the mystery\Nof this detestable murder for you.
0.5;Plotted by a certain\Nsomeone from the start.
0.5;that they act out a little play\Nto surprise everyone at the party.
0.5;In it, Mishima-san would pretend\Nto shoot someone, then kill himself.
0.5;To lay the groundwork for this,\Nthey had a fake argument beforehand.
0.5;First, you modified two\Nmodel guns of the same type
0.5;"One type was a real lead bullet.\NThe other was an empty ""blank."""
0.5;You initially gave Mishima-san\Nthe gun with the blanks.
0.5;Today, before the party began,\Nyou met him at the Beika Shrine
0.5;and switched his gun\Nwith the gun with real bullets...
0.5;Probably by saying\Nyou were doing final checks.
0.5;Then the gun on Honda-san's\Nhip is Mishima-san's?!
0.5;No, wait. Wasn't the\Nbarrel of that gun plugged?
0.5;so he wouldn't\Nrouse suspicion after the fact.
0.5;Honda-san dressed\Nup as a Laser Police member
0.5;instead of his usual\Nchoice of Masked Yaiba
0.5;because it wouldn't seem\Nstrange for a Laser Police member
0.5;to carry a gun and\Nwear a bulletproof vest.
0.5;you moved as if taking\Nus out of harm's way,
0.5;but it was actually to make\Nyou an easier target for him.
0.5;Wouldn't Mishima know something\Nwas up if a real bullet came out?
0.5;He and Honda-san\Nhad probably done rehearsals
0.5;in which he would pretend to be\Nhit the same time the gun sounded.
0.5;"So, after seeing Honda-san\Nbeing ""hit"" this time,"
0.5;Mishima-san believed it was\Njust like it was during rehearsal.
0.5;But do you have any evidence\Nthat he didn't commit suicide?
0.5;If you were to kill yourself by\Nputting a gun to your head and firing,
0.5;Even with blanks,\Nit still produces a small flame.
0.5;Which is why he held the\Ngun slightly away from his head,
0.5;Another set of fingerprints not\Nbelonging to the late Mishima-san
0.5;They also match the\Nchild's fingerprints on this badge.
0.5;Genta-kun! When did you\Ntouch Mishima-san's gun?!
0.5;If Genta didn't touch Mishima-san's gun,\Nhow did his prints get on it?
0.5;You ran into us at the Beika Shrine\Nbefore coming here, right?
0.5;is evidence that\Nyou switched your guns later!
0.5;Mori-san. When did\Nyou start to suspect me?
0.5;Tsutsumi-san said that\Nyou were a real gun aficionado.
0.5;Yet, you had a plugged gun.\NThat seemed odd to me.
0.5;I see. Plugging the gun to be\Nextra safe proved to be my downfall...
0.5;Mishima...\Nkilled my kid brother!
0.5;Two years ago, my brother Hiroshi\Nwas heading to a friend's house
0.5;"His final words were,\N""Get Masked Yaiba to catch him..."""
0.5;...Mishima finally\Nshowed me that signboard!
0.5;He said his older brother\Nhad won it and given it to him!
0.5;But he doesn't have\Na brother named Hiroshi!
0.5;Inspector, it's not\Ndiscussed in the TV drama,
0.5;but Masked Yaiba has a back\Nstory in which his sister was killed.
0.5;I joined fan clubs to kill the person\Nwho drove my brother to death,
0.5;but at some point, I began\Nto feel just like Masked Yaiba.
0.5;It's a shame you were that\Nwrong about Masked Yaiba all along.
0.5;Oh! Yoko-chan's on\Na music show starting at 7:30!
0.5;Oh, but we're watching\NMasked Yaiba at 7:30.
0.5;After all, Masked Yaiba fights for justice!\NWe gotta support him!
0.5;Don't be stupid!\NWhat about Yoko-chan?!
0.5;It's possible it was a murder\Nplotted by one of these people!
0.5;They ignored our warnings that \Nwe'd kill them if they resisted.
0.5;He beautifully dances his \Nmystery-solving steps!
0.5;Will the Detective Boys \Ncome in contact with them?
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;The serial armed robbery and \Narson group known as Zorro
0.5;murdered three residents \Nof the home they broke into,
0.5;According to the other patrol officer, the \Nculprit fired a crossbow without warning.
0.5;This is the fourth wealthy \Nhome they've targeted.
0.5;The MPD is doing everything it \Ncan to arrest these criminals.
0.5;That kid who always sticks \Nhis nose in news like this?
0.5;Conan-kun went out with \NAi-chan and the other kids.
0.5;Unfortunately, we have to cook \Nfor ourselves here, Kojima-kun.
0.5;Anyway, your connections never \Nfail to impress, Professor.
0.5;I can't believe you know the \Nperson who owns this villa.
0.5;Maybe he made a mistake while \Nbreaking in and hurt himself.
0.5;if he can shoot himself in \Nthe arm with a crossbow.
0.5;What are you going to do with \Nthat? Give it back to him?
0.5;I thought I'd ask him about \Nit, but he's not awake yet.
0.5;Does that mean this is connected \Nto yesterday's case?
0.5;He's a skilled hacker our cyber-crimes \Ndivision was pursuing, too.
0.5;that they had a likely \Nsuspect in their custody,
0.5;I'll be able to give \NKogoro-no-ojisan a full report.
0.5;One of yesterday's robbers was found at \Nthe villa where the kids are staying?
0.5;I don't know what happened, but he was \Nhiding in the yard with an injury.
0.5;There's no way Conan-kun would \Njust sit still after this.
0.5;He'll definitely get up \Nto something dangerous.
0.5;Yeah, but it's not like I've \Nbeen hired to investigate.
0.5;I'm finally back here, but \Nit's completely dark out.
0.5;You put us through all this \Nunnecessary work, traitor.
0.5;Mystery-solving logic\Ndrenches the walls of dry hearts!
0.5;Today's case is the\Nfirst original TV 2-parter!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Hey! Isn't that the boat\Nthat was lost seven years ago?!
0.5;There was 1 billion yen\Nin gold on that ship...
0.5;That can't be!\NWhere did all the gold go?!
0.5;Why do you suppose\Nit turned up only now?
0.5;You fools! There is no curse!\NIt's just a dumb superstition!
0.5;I hear a ship that went missing\Nwith 1 billion yen in gold onboard
0.5;Yes! People on the\Nisland think it's a ghost ship!
0.5;No. We're not even sure\Nthere really was any onboard.
0.5;The mayor is just glad that the\Ntown has garnered a lot of attention.
0.5;All of Japan knows about the\Ngreat detective Kogoro Mori-san--
0.5;He wants to create a tour\Ncentered around the ghost ship.
0.5;Mori-sensei! Thank you\Nfor coming all this way!
0.5;I thought you\Nwould've been a lot cooler.
0.5;Suzu-kun! Don't be rude\Nto Daddy's guest!
0.5;I'm Suzu Mikami! It looks like\NI'm a little older than you!
0.5;I'm Uehara from Toto Travel Agency.\NNice to meet you.
0.5;Likewise! We'll help in\Nany way to bring tourists here!
0.5;This ship was on\Nthe ocean floor for years
0.5;but only has barnacles\Non its underside.
0.5;Here, Mori-sensei!\NThere's still time until the lecture!
0.5;These cooked turban\Nshells are delicious!
0.5;Say, after the lecture,\NI'd like to ask for your help...
0.5;You want me to find\Nwhere the Ryujin-Maru sank?
0.5;Such perceptiveness!\NI think it sank near this island.
0.5;But if it were recovered,\Nit wouldn't belong to you.
0.5;The government\Nwould come to collect it.
0.5;But wouldn't we\Nbe entitled to 10% of it?
0.5;How about 10% of\Nthe island's reward money?
0.5;It happened on a stormy\Nnight seven years ago.
0.5;We received an SOS from the\NRyujin-Maru about 1 km offshore.
0.5;However, the signal disappeared\Nas a rescue crew headed for it,
0.5;No debris was ever found,\Nmuch less the gold.
0.5;The ship's owner's. He was\Ngoing to be arrested for tax evasion
0.5;Very well! I, Kogoro Mori,\Nshall locate the gold for you!
0.5;Isn't he just gonna\Nhumiliate himself?
0.5;But the islanders wanted the\Nreward money for their heads
0.5;Various bad things\Nhave occurred ever since.
0.5;Yes. So a shrine was built in the\Ncave to quiet the Suigun's spirits.
0.5;Many people who live near the\Ncave have seen armor-clad ghosts,
0.5;and eerie groans can be heard\Ncoming from the cave's depths.
0.5;when a university professor\Nstudying the Suigun visited.
0.5;He ignored the islanders'\Nwarnings and went to examine the cave.
0.5;Yes. It was never confirmed,\Nbut he was never seen again.
0.5;Nobody dares go near\Nthat cave anymore.
0.5;Believing that in this day and\Nage is why you get laughed at!
0.5;Daddy said the professor\Nchecked the cave but probably left
0.5;Let's go, Conan-kun!\NI'll show you a great place!
0.5;We can sneak backstage from here!\NBest seats in the house!
0.5;Hamada, the lighthouse keeper.\NHe's really weird!
0.5;He hardly hangs out with anyone,\Nand he always goes to that cave.
0.5;What are you talking about?\NI'm Hamada, the lighthouse keeper!
0.5;Now then, here is the peerless\NDetective Kogoro Mori-sensei!
0.5;Will he be all\Nright drunk like that?
0.5;Let's have him break the\Ncelebration ball in honor of his visit!
0.5;It's the curse!\NThe Suigun curse!
0.5;Ah. That string was modified\Nto ignite the gasoline inside.
0.5;and the man he got in\Nan argument with, Uehara-san.
0.5;Could it have something\Nto do with the ghost ship?!
0.5;I only survived because\NI'm so well-trained!
0.5;My deepest apologies for getting\Nyou involved in such an accident!
0.5;Accident?!\NSomeone clearly planned that!
0.5;You sure you just don't\Nwant a police incident?
0.5;Weren't gonna turn the gold\Nover if you found it, were you?
0.5;But you'd have no choice\Nif the mainland police showed up.
0.5;Mori-san! You just need to\Nkeep quiet and find the gold!
0.5;Defy me and there's no guarantee\Nyou'll leave the island unharmed.
0.5;You can't take the ferry\Nwithout my authorization.
0.5;Well, take your time\Nto think it over tonight.
0.5;Looks like we came\Nto a pretty bad island...
0.5;I apologize. The mayor seems\Nto only care about finding the gold
0.5;and turning the island\Ninto a tourist attraction.
0.5;I'll take you back\Nto the mainland anyway.
0.5;Luckily, I can prepare\Na small fishing boat.
0.5;No self-respecting detective\Nwould dare run away now!
0.5;He came here a while after\Nthe Ryujin-Maru incident
0.5;There was no one working the\Nlighthouse, so he took that job.
0.5;How rude! You should thank\Nme for following you late at night!
0.5;So it was Hamada-san\Nwho tried to kill him!
0.5;It's pointed at the mountains.\NThey'd be boring to look at.
0.5;That's strange. A lighthouse\Ntelescope should be pointing out to sea.
0.5;But this one is fixed\Ntoward the mountains!
0.5;No question about it! Hamada-san\Nis connected to the Ryujin-Maru!
0.5;It's hard to run\Nwith my sore butt!
0.5;They ring it whenever\Nsomething happens!
0.5;That detective killed Hamada,\Nthe lighthouse keeper!
0.5;Check for yourself\Nif you think we're lying!
0.5;When we arrived on the scene,\Nthe detective was unconscious
0.5;The ghosts got mad because\Nan outsider was poking around!
0.5;He would never\Ndo something like this!
0.5;No, this was no suicide!\NIn which case, the killer is--
0.5;High school student Shinichi was forced\Nto take a drug that shrunk him!
0.5;Although smaller, my mind remains\Nthat of a sharp detective!
0.5;A review of the last episode\Nwill accompany the theme song!
0.5;It's a big ship, but there's\Nalways only one truth!
0.5;before we were picked up by a ship\Nthat the Hatamoto family had reserved.
0.5;Including the three of us and the butler,\Nthere were only 10 people onboard.
0.5;On our way back to land,\NHatamoto Gozo,
0.5;head of the Hatamoto family,\Nwas murdered in his room.
0.5;who entered the family\Nby marrying Hatamoto Natsue.
0.5;He turned out to be\Nthe son of Zaiki Isao,
0.5;who killed himself after Gozo took over\Nhis company 10 years earlier!
0.5;Since he had a motive, everyone decided\Nto lock Takeshi in a storeroom.
0.5;It looked like the case was closed,\Nbut there was more to come.
0.5;Hatamoto Tatsuo, Akie's husband,\Nwas found dead,
0.5;and Takeshi had escaped\Nfrom the storeroom!
0.5;if you hadn't brought Takeshi\Ninto our family!
0.5;You can't be serious!\NI don't care about his fortune!
0.5;We're still not certain that Takeshi-san\Nis the one responsible, you know.
0.5;The storeroom door was unlocked\Nwhen we checked it out, right?
0.5;unless someone unlocked it\Nfrom the outside.
0.5;the three of you were alone\Nin your private rooms,
0.5;while you two were together\Nin your shared room.
0.5;Well, I couldn't sleep,\Nso I went for a little walk...
0.5;Which means that just\Nlike the first murder,
0.5;aside from everyone\Nwho was with Natsue-san,
0.5;You gotta be kidding me!\NMy husband just died!
0.5;I know that you've been\Nseeing other men!
0.5;You had a big enough reason\Nto kill Grandfather!
0.5;You're the one who wanted\Nhis inheritance the most!
0.5;after Grandfather tore up\Nhis prize-winning drawing!
0.5;That was Father's fault--\Nhe never recognized this boy's talent!
0.5;"""Depressed introvert""\Nand stuff like that..."
0.5;And the one who wanted to be\Nfree of Grandfather the most...
0.5;I'll be fine. I'm not\Na weakling like my father!
0.5;Did something happen\Nbetween Kitaro-san and Gozo-san?
0.5;Kitaro-sama has wanted to leave\Nthe Hatamoto family for a long time.
0.5;He says he doesn't have the ambition\Nto run the family company.
0.5;Gozo-sama was greatly\Nopposed to the idea...
0.5;I don't think his wife Mariko-sama\Nwould have allowed it either...
0.5;It's been 20 minutes, but Ichiro\Nstill isn't back from the restroom!
0.5;I was with you all in the dining room\Nwhen the power went out!
0.5;There is only one person\Nwho could have done it!
0.5;Let Natsue-san and Ran take care\Nof Ichiro-kun's bandage.
0.5;I'd like the rest of you to come\Nto the electrical room with me.
0.5;This one is simple enough\Nfor anyone to set up.
0.5;After enough time passes,\Nthe rope burns apart,
0.5;which causes the weight\Nto pull down on the breaker.
0.5;Judging from how much\Nof the candle has melted,
0.5;In other words, any one of you could\Nbe responsible for the power outage.
0.5;At any rate, I'll take the responsibility\Nof finding Takeshi-san.
0.5;Until I do, I don't want any of you\Nto take a step out of the dining room!
0.5;Then maybe he's not\Non the ship anymore?
0.5;These two seem to have rather\Ndifferent personalities.
0.5;Yes. They're both cousins,\Nand although it may not look like it,
0.5;they've been good friends\Nsince they were little.
0.5;Gozo-sama was extremely\Nopposed to them, too.
0.5;Doesn't look like he's\Nin Joji-san's room, either.
0.5;One knife we found right\Nafter Ichiro-kun was attacked,
0.5;That's no reason to\Nenter the room carelessly!
0.5;Takeshi-kun could be hiding\Nin here with a weapon!
0.5;He wasn't in our rooms\Nor in Natsue-san's room.
0.5;All that's left is\NAkie-san's room here...
0.5;How did you find out?\NOnly Gozo-sama and I know about that!
0.5;The first incident,\Nin which Mr. Gozo was killed...
0.5;The bread found near the body,\Nand the location of the murder weapon...
0.5;The second incident,\Nin which Tatsuo-san was killed...
0.5;The splash and thud sounds I heard\Nat the time of the murder...
0.5;The person who unlocked\Nthe storeroom door...
0.5;And then the third incident, in which\NIchiro-san was stabbed in the dark...
0.5;Each of these mysteries is connected\Nby a single thread!
0.5;so he wants everyone to come\Nto Akie-san's room in 10 minutes.
0.5;Before I reveal the killer's name,\Nlet us look at the incidents again.
0.5;Mr. Gozo likely escaped back into\Nhis room after he was stabbed outside.
0.5;We later found a flower on the ground\Nin front of the room!
0.5;Even though Mr. Gozo was\Nstabbed outside his room,
0.5;Are you sure the killer\Ndidn't wipe it up
0.5;to delay us from\Ndiscovering the corpse?
0.5;I'm just saying that the flower fell\Nafter the blood was wiped up!
0.5;I can understand if the\Nkiller accidentally dropped it
0.5;while stabbing the victim\Nand then escaping...
0.5;But the killer meticulously\Nwiped up the blood.
0.5;By leaving the flower there,\Neveryone would've noticed it.
0.5;In other words, the killer purposely\Nleft the flower on the ground
0.5;Next is Incident #2, in which\NTatsuo-san was murdered on the deck.
0.5;Unlike the first incident\Nwith its flower
0.5;and the third incident\Nwith its fancy set-up,
0.5;this incident lacked\Nany sort of artificiality.
0.5;If these were all indeed\Ndone by the same person,
0.5;The answer to that question\Nis in this case.
0.5;We found one of them\Nat the scene of Incident #3,
0.5;The main point here is in\Nthe two sounds that Conan heard.
0.5;The thud was likely the sound\Nof the killer striking Tatsuo-san,
0.5;the splash sound was the\Nother knife from this case.
0.5;the killer could have killed\Nhim to keep things quiet.
0.5;But Takeshi vanished from the storeroom\Nafter the 2nd incident!
0.5;Yeah! Takeshi is the\Nmost suspicious here!
0.5;No, that storeroom door\Nwas locked from the outside.
0.5;Tatsuo-san's murder wasn't\Npart of the killer's plan,
0.5;and it took place\Nwhile Takeshi-san was locked up.
0.5;The killer worked so hard to\Nmake Takeshi-san look guilty,
0.5;but this 2nd murder would do just\Nthe opposite and prove his innocence.
0.5;This was done to make it\Nlook like Takeshi-san
0.5;had the ability to murder\NTatsuo-san, as well.
0.5;Takeshi-san. Why don't you\Nstop hiding and come out?
0.5;Now then, tell us what happened\Nwhen you escaped from the storeroom.
0.5;I thought something\Nhappened to Natsue...
0.5;and as I was pounding on the door,\Nit suddenly unlocked.
0.5;I ran into Akie-san's room,\Nwhose door just happened to be open.
0.5;After that, I stayed inside\Nthe closet the entire time.
0.5;So the person who stabbed\NIchiro-san during Incident #3
0.5;Why would they do something\Nthis horrible to Ichiro?!
0.5;The killer had managed\Nto frame Takeshi-san,
0.5;but now it looked like he had\Nan accomplice who had let him out!
0.5;It wasn't until then that anyone\Nstarted to suspect the real killer!
0.5;Flustered, the murderer\Ncame up with a scheme
0.5;Incident #3, in which Ichiro-san\Nwas attacked in the restroom.
0.5;But it was in this incident that\Nthe killer dug his own grave.
0.5;In the darkness, the killer shouldn't\Nhave been able to see Ichiro-kun.
0.5;Even so, he was clearly able to see\NIchiro-kun well enough to stab him.
0.5;Moreover, the weapon was found\Nlying at the scene of the crime.
0.5;Unlike the first two incidents,\Nthe attacker didn't leave with the weapon!
0.5;No, the attacker couldn't\Nhave left with it.
0.5;After all, he couldn't go anywhere\Nwith his injured leg.
0.5;The person who stabbed him...\Nwas Ichiro-kun himself!
0.5;And the one who killed\NMr. Gozo and Tatsuo-san...
0.5;was because you didn't want\Nto identify your attacker.
0.5;If you said it was Takeshi-san\Nand then he was found innocent later,
0.5;then all the suspicion\Nwould fall onto you.
0.5;Do you have any evidence\Nthat Ichiro's the murderer?!
0.5;The piece of bread that was\Nfound near Mr. Gozo's body.
0.5;Bread pieces are sometimes used\Nas erasers for charcoal sketches,
0.5;and I hear that these pieces\Noften fall into artists' cuffs.
0.5;When he stabbed Mr. Gozo,\Nthat piece of bread fell out of his cuff.
0.5;What's more, this bread piece\Nhas a tiny bit of charcoal on it.
0.5;There is no doubt that it was\NIchiro-kun who dropped it!
0.5;I, myself, couldn't tell what\Nhis motive was until the very end.
0.5;Until I saw something\Nin his room, that is.
0.5;This is Ichiro-kun's motive\Nfor killing Mr. Gozo.
0.5;Unable to reveal\Nyour feelings to Natsue-san,
0.5;It's true! I asked him\Nto let me marry Natsue-san!
0.5;He refused to give his beloved\NNatsue-san to someone like me!
0.5;And soon after that,\Nalmost as if to spite me,
0.5;he announced that Natsue-san\Nwas going to marry Takeshi-san!
0.5;while I was on the deck,\Ndrawing Natsue-san...
0.5;Tell him to give up\Nhis hopeless dream!
0.5;Not my grandfather, who refused\Nto let me marry Natsue-san...
0.5;Do you still feel the same way\Ntoward my grandfather and us?
0.5;who committed suicide after the\NHatamoto Group took over his company.
0.5;And it's true that I got close to you\Nbecause I hated your grandfather.
0.5;The tragedy was caused\Nby a shy young man
0.5;who was unable to put his\Nsecret thoughts into words...
0.5;...while being bathed by the red sunset\Nthat is the sadness and despair
0.5;of Ichiro-san and the\Nentire Hatamoto family.
0.5;The Case of the\NMysterious Woman with Amnesia.
0.5;As times change, difficult\Ncases will increase in number!
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;Sheesh! You finally call me\Nfor once but you have a cold!
0.5;No point in lying, Missy.\NI know he's here!
0.5;How do you know that\Nif you dunno where he is?
0.5;Shinichi called just\Nnow with a nasally voice.
0.5;So I guess the rumor you're\NKudo's woman really is true...
0.5;He told me about good\Nmystery novels he read recently,
0.5;the J-League, and asked\Nhow people at school are.
0.5;he always talks about\Nhimself and never about me.
0.5;His occasional calls mean\Nhe has some interest in you.
0.5;Wouldn't someone like that\Ncare how the other person is doing?
0.5;There's only one reason why\Nhe wouldn't ask that.
0.5;A high school detective,\Njust like Kudo.
0.5;Hey, kid. I got just\Nthe thing for your cold!
0.5;I have heard of a\Nskilled detective in Kansai...
0.5;"Yep. They call us ""Hattori of the West""\Nand ""Kudo of the East."""
0.5;But there's been no\Nword about Kudo lately.
0.5;Conan-kun! Hey!\NWhat did you give him!
0.5;I see this agency isn't\Nequipped to greet clients, either!
0.5;I'm in a hurry,\Nso could we make this quick?
0.5;A background check\Non your son's girlfriend?
0.5;Graduated Mitsuba Middle School\Nand High School top of her class,
0.5;currently attends\NToto Medical University.
0.5;Well on her way to\Nbecoming a woman doctor.
0.5;People are inquisitive,\Njealous creatures...
0.5;In any case, we can talk in more\Ndetail at my home, with my husband.
0.5;As I told you,\Nmy husband is a diplomat.
0.5;It'd be less suspicious\Nif we went as a family, right?
0.5;Besides, who knows,\Nmaybe Kudo'll show up!
0.5;but there's no telling\Nwhat this guy might say!
0.5;He still won't come out\Nof his study, though.
0.5;Umm, might these people be\Nacquaintances of yours, Mother?
0.5;"And you have no\Nright to call me ""Mother""!"
0.5;Come, now! You said you wanted\Nto hear about the fish I caught!
0.5;Honestly, now! Leaving the stereo\Non and taking a nap in here!
0.5;And his lips are\Nstarting to turn purple.
0.5;There's a small\Nred dot by his hairline...
0.5;Kids shouldn't be\Nseeing dead bodies, anyway!
0.5;The deceased is Tsujimura Isao-san,\Nage 54 and a diplomat.
0.5;And the detective who happened\Nto be here when the body was found...
0.5;So, is it another\Nmurder today, great detective?
0.5;Well, as there are no\Nsigns of foul play, it's probably--
0.5;and a needle's\Nlying next to the body.
0.5;but he was probably set that\Nway after someone poisoned him.
0.5;The lips and digits\Nare turning purple,
0.5;Yet, there are no signs at all of\Nstrangulation, drowning, or suffering.
0.5;with powerful poison\Nthat can kill instantly!
0.5;Add in the body's warmth\Nand the lack of rigor mortis
0.5;and that means he\Nwas killed half an hour
0.5;And by someone\Nwho stopped by this room...
0.5;Hattori Heiji.\NA cheeky kid detective.
0.5;It's strange, Hattori-kun\Nsomehow reminds me of Shinichi...
0.5;This is bad!\NMy cold's gotten worse!
0.5;All the windows are\Nlocked from the inside.
0.5;Madam. I assume there are\Nseveral spare keys to this study?
0.5;I have one here.\NMy husband has the other.
0.5;Yes. He always kept it\Nin his pants pocket.
0.5;In other words,\Nthe killer locked the door and left!
0.5;One of the keys is with his wife,\Nwho entered the room with us,
0.5;and the other was in a double\Npocket of the victim's pants...
0.5;Making this an\Nabsolutely impossible crime...
0.5;This guy's been in the papers,\Nbut he didn't solve those cases.
0.5;This guy secretly\Ncontacts Kudo for help.
0.5;Let's see who solves this locked\Nroom murder first, Kudo Shinichi!
0.5;Shouldn't you start by asking\Nall the suspects for their alibis?!
0.5;Do you want some outsider\Nkid to upstage you?!
0.5;I'm counting on you\Nas always, great detective!
0.5;So you spoke with neighbors at\Nthe front door between 3:00 and 4:00?
0.5;Is it true Takayoshi-san\Nand Yukiko-san
0.5;So where were you two while\Nhe was greeting her at the door?
0.5;But the door was locked\Nand he wouldn't respond,
0.5;It was shortly after\N2:00 when you arrived, yes?
0.5;I came all this way,\Nbut Isao was holed up in here,
0.5;I went to the next room\Nand watched TV.
0.5;Which means that only those\Nthree could've gotten near the victim
0.5;Classical? Oh yeah, there was\Nan opera playing when we found him...
0.5;Oh? Madam.\NWhat is this photograph?
0.5;This photo is twenty years old!\NWhat does it matter?!
0.5;Inspector! What shall we\Ndo with the books on the desk?
0.5;Come to think of it, there were\Nirrelevant books stacked by the body.
0.5;Almost as if pulled\Nstraight out of the bookshelf...
0.5;Inspector. We found something\Nodd about the victim's key.
0.5;Got any realizations for me,\Ngreat detective?
0.5;The unnaturally-stacked\Nbooks in front of the body,
0.5;and the opera playing\Nat the scene of the crime!
0.5;The mysterious bulge\Nin the middle of it!
0.5;He asked where the\NJapanese-style room was, then left.
0.5;It has to be here!\NIf my theory's right...
0.5;I'm sorry, but is there\Nanywhere he can lie down?
0.5;The locked room trick,\Nand who did it.
0.5;Hate to ask, but could\Nyou play the role of the body?
0.5;all the windows were\Nlocked from the inside,
0.5;and the only other entrance\Nwas locked as well.
0.5;That clearly makes this\Na locked room murder.
0.5;But even when this room seems locked,\Nthere's still one opening.
0.5;Hey, now. You're not suggesting\Nthe key was thrown through that gap
0.5;With tape and this needle-ended\Nfishing line I found!
0.5;Fainting from a\Ncold at a time like this!
0.5;After pricking the victim's\Nneck with the needle and killing him,
0.5;The killer then took out\Nthe needle-ended fishing line,
0.5;taped the non-needle\Nend to the key holder,
0.5;stuck the needle\Nend into the victim's pocket,
0.5;The killer then took both ends\Noutside the room, beneath the door,
0.5;All that remained was to put the\Nkey down and pull the needle end.
0.5;The key slipped under\Nthe door, climbed up the table,
0.5;and entered the\Nvictim's pocket on its own.
0.5;Then, by simply winding it up,\Nthe evidence disappeared
0.5;"and created the perfect\N""locked room murder""!"
0.5;Say something,\NConan-kun! Conan-kun!
0.5;I'm burning up...\NMy heart's about to burst...
0.5;Hang in there!\NI'll bring him right here!
0.5;If you got any problems\Nwith my theory, show yourself!
0.5;Just what's wrong\Nwith my theory, Kudo?!
0.5;I'm back for the first time in 14 months.\N It's me, Kudo Shinichi.
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 800 ""After \NThat Hundred Million Yen"""
0.5;"The kidnapper told us, \N""Don't tell the police."""
0.5;there's no telling what the kidnapper \Nwill do to their daughter!

0.5;If they say they'll return the hostage \Nlater, don't give them a cent!
0.5;But if I refuse, there's not telling what \Nthe kidnapper will do to Reina-chan.
0.5;That's easy for you to say\Nsince it's not your money,
0.5;If they take my money and I \Ndon't get my daughter back...

0.5;Is this the site of the demolished \Ncar factory in Haido-cho?
0.5;The kidnapper has a station wagon and new \Nbag at the demolished Haido-cho factory.
0.5;He's going to make her \Nswitch bags and cars there.
0.5;The kidnapper must have expected \Nthem to call the police,
0.5;Get to the demolished factory \Nand attach transmitters
0.5;to the station wagon and \Nbag the kidnapper prepared.
0.5;Do whatever it takes to get it \Ndone before Suzuko-san arrives.
0.5;Inspector! It's too dangerous for the \Ninvestigators to approach the car!
0.5;There's no cover around the \Ntarget vehicle anywhere!
0.5;The investigators' movements \Nwill be in plain sight!
0.5;he should know the police would \Nmake note of the bill numbers.
0.5;There are security cameras \Neverywhere these days.
0.5;He'd be caught immediately if \Nhe tried to use those bills.
0.5;Suzuko-san has transferred the ransom, \Nand she's leaving in the station wagon.
0.5;Are you familiar with the Matsubara \Njewelry store in Kuin-cho?
0.5;Use the ransom money to buy a 100 \Nmillion yen's worth of diamonds there.
0.5;What? You want me to buy \Ndiamonds worth 100 million?
0.5;I see. He's going to exchange \Nthe cash for diamonds.
0.5;Will I really be able to buy diamonds worth \N100 million yen without advance notice?
0.5;I've ordered ten diamonds \Nunder President Saeki's name.
0.5;Ten diamonds can be hidden in a pocket, \Nand they can be exchanged for money.
0.5;For bills with numbers unknown \Nto the police, no less.
0.5;Let's call the jewelry store and \Nstop them from selling the diamonds.
0.5;Yes, ten diamonds the size \Nof my pinkie fingertip.
0.5;Head slowly towards Sakura Street,\Nand turn left at the first traffic signal.
0.5;He'll have plenty of escape \Nroutes to choose from.
0.5;We'll be relying on the \Ninformation Suzuko-san gives us.
0.5;I just want to see Reina-chan \Nas soon as possible.
0.5;I see. I'd like to release Reina-chan \Nas soon as possible as well.
0.5;Tanaka-san, you're wearing \Na wire, aren't you?
0.5;You've been repeating me a \Nlot in our conversations.
0.5;At first I thought you were doing it to\Nconfirm what I said, but it seems I was wrong.
0.5;You're reporting the situation \Nto the police, aren't you?
0.5;Are you sure there isn't \Na pin mic in your brooch?
0.5;I've been watching you through binoculars \Nsince the beginning, and it's been bothering me.
0.5;If you want me to return Reina-chan, \Nthrow it out the car window.
0.5;The police will only interfere \Nwith our trade going smoothly.
0.5;Yes. The kidnapper prepared \Na bicycle beforehand,
0.5;This situation has turned \Ninto what we feared.
0.5;In her desperation to save the hostage, \Nshe's lost her sense of judgment.
0.5;Where did she take the jewels \Nworth 100 million yen?
0.5;Th-Then she ran off with the \Njewels worth 100 million yen?
0.5;Have she been deceiving us \Nsince yesterday's kidnapping?
0.5;He said I'd find a bottle \Ntied with red ribbon.
0.5;He told me to put them in there \Nand send it down the river.
0.5;Yes. I came to this pier because he told me \Nto, and I found a bottle tied with red ribbon.
0.5;Now that you mention it, for some reason the \Ncleanly washed bottle was covered in ants.
0.5;Mister, did you know there \Nwas a kidnapping today?
0.5;I see. The jewels were put in a \Nbottle and sent down the river.
0.5;If after losing the ransom, \Ntheir daughter hadn't come home...
0.5;Look. I brought the bottle \Nwith the jewels in it.
0.5;Why did the kidnapper release Reina-chan \Nif he didn't get the diamonds?
0.5;And the other weird thing is you couldn't \Nbuy ten diamonds this big with 100 million.
0.5;I see. Then the housekeeper Suzuko-san \Nmust have swapped them out for fakes.
0.5;Suzuko-san must have been \Nworking with the kidnapper.
0.5;then there would be no need to \Nprepare these fake diamonds.
0.5;"All she'd have to say was, ""I gave\Nthe kidnapper the diamonds."""
0.5;You're the one who sold these pieces \Nof glass to her for 100 million.
0.5;Matsubara Jewelry Store \Nowner Matsubara Akira-san.
0.5;There are two reasons you chose Suzuko-san \Nto transport the ransom money.
0.5;First, Reina-chan was the \Napple of Suzuko-san's eye.
0.5;You believed she'd do as you told \Nher if it was for Reina-chan.
0.5;Second, if the wealthy Saeki-san or \Nhis wife had transported the ransom,
0.5;they might have figured out \Nthe diamonds were fake.
0.5;so you believed it unlikely \Nthat she would figure it out.
0.5;It seems Suzuko-san was \Ntoo frightened to notice,
0.5;but this bottle is much \Nlighter than normal bottles.
0.5;Even a normal bottle was \Nunlikely to be collected,
0.5;but in order to bring that possibility as \Nclose to zero as possible, you used this bottle.
0.5;A sugar glass bottle used as \Nprops in movies and TV shows.
0.5;This bottle would melt or be smashed to \Npieces while floating down the river.
0.5;The fake diamonds would sink to the bottom\Nof the river and become unrecoverable.
0.5;Then you could openly use the \N100 million you acquired.
0.5;After all, you got the money through \Na proper business transaction.
0.5;Normally, ransoms are handed \Nover at the very end.
0.5;But you tried to collect it while \Nthe ransom was being transported
0.5;Sugar glass bottles have limited\Nuses and a short shelf life,
0.5;If you trace how the bottle was \Nacquired, your name will turn up.
0.5;Besides, thinking they'd sink \Nto the bottom of the river,
0.5;you probably carelessly handled the fake \Ndiamonds and left your fingerprints on them.
0.5;If I break this bottle, \Nthere won't be any proof—
0.5;Not even a kid would do \Nthat in this freezing cold.

0.5;Kogoro and I ran into \Ncomedian DoDonPa Rokusuke
0.5;turning himself in at the \Npolice station near Beika Station.
0.5;He claimed to have killed Hideki Tendo, \Nthe president of his talent agency.
0.5;However, the police investigation \Nturned up inconsistencies
0.5;with the murder weapon, time of death,\Nand contradictions in his testimony.
0.5;When a witness to his alibi named \NIzumi Suda-san was discovered,
0.5;In order to protect the \Nreputation of Hideki Tendo,
0.5;Hey, how did you guys know \NDoDonPa-san turned himself in?
0.5;Every station received an \Nanonymous tip by phone.
0.5;I can't imagine that policeman \Nleaked the information,
0.5;Maybe his goal wasn't to become the \Nculprit of a murder he didn't commit,
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;An unexpected remark brings \Nan alibi crashing down.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;She left early this morning \Nfor a karate match.
0.5;In order to protect the \Nreputation of Hideki Tendo,
0.5;He was thrust into the spotlight, \Nand he's the man of the hour.
0.5;Watching him on TV, I thought he was \Nan unpleasant man with a strong personality,
0.5;he must be getting a lot of \Noffers and raking in the cash!
0.5;Kogoro asked me to check\Nout the crime scene.
0.5;Did the suspect use this emergency \Nstaircase to enter and exit the building?
0.5;He was also wondering about the metal\Npipe that was the murder weapon.
0.5;They said he's not the \Ntype to extort someone.
0.5;That's totally different from\Nwhat DoDonPa-san said.
0.5;The police department just \Nreceived a call from the suspect,
0.5;I understand how you feel, \Nbut could you tell me your name?
0.5;She called from a public phone, \Nand I already sent some investigators there.
0.5;I thought I might be able to \Nhelp you find the murderer.
0.5;At this rate, Tendo-san won't \Nbe able to rest in peace.
0.5;Nah. Kogoro said he already \Nknows who the true culprit is.
0.5;I have a habit of eating while watching \Nmorning programs that start at 8:00.
0.5;So you eat while watching \Nthe female announcer.
0.5;tell him to come here himself \Ninstead of sending a kid!
0.5;I see. She certainly is \Ndetached from the world...
0.5;That's probably why he used \Nher to create his alibi.
0.5;Once I enter my studio, \NI don't stop painting.
0.5;That's right. It was exactly \N9:00, just like he said.
0.5;Do you lock the door to the studio \Nwhen you sleep here at night?
0.5;There's nothing here anyone \Nwould want to steal.
0.5;If they could talk, \Nthey'd be begging you to stop.
0.5;I started handing them out just \Nbefore 10:00 AM yesterday.
0.5;Did you give any to someone \Nyou recognized from TV?
0.5;I heard he determined the \Nidentity of the suspect.
0.5;I received a call from \NMouri-san on my way to work.
0.5;Inspector, I heard you determined \Nthe identity of the suspect.
0.5;Th-This is the Sleeping \NKogoro I've heard about.
0.5;The story about Tendo\Nextorting someone is a lie.
0.5;even if it meant bearing the guilt \Nof a murder I didn't commit.
0.5;I have an alibi for yesterday at 9:00 \Nwhen the president was murdered.
0.5;Yesterday morning, \Nyou secretly came to Beika City
0.5;You stole a metal pipe from \Na deserted construction site,
0.5;and took the emergency staircase to \Narrive at this office around 9:00.
0.5;You ate breakfast this morning around \N8:00 like you always do, didn't you?
0.5;for when they determine the time\Nof your death during the autopsy.
0.5;After committing the crime, you hid \Nthe weapon behind the apartment,
0.5;hurried back to Akebono City, \Nand visited Suda-san's studio...
0.5;What if that clock were \Nrunning one hour slow?
0.5;We checked for ourselves \Nwhen we went to talk to her.
0.5;He returned the clock to the correct time\Nbefore the police came to check on it.
0.5;for Suda-san to fall asleep \Nbefore breaking into her studio.
0.5;wouldn't notice if her clock \Nwere running one hour behind.
0.5;You made Suda-san believe \Nyou visited her at 9:00.
0.5;Additionally, you put sleeping pills \Nin the cake you brought for her.
0.5;Then you returned the \Nclock to the correct time.
0.5;This will be the inspiration for \Nmy next comic monologue, Mouri-san.
0.5;you got into an argument with \Nsomeone near Suda-san's studio.
0.5;Hey, you're DoDonPa\NRokusuke-san, aren't you?
0.5;There are plenty of other \Npeople who have art books.
0.5;We'll know the truth once we check \Nthe prints on the art books.
0.5;I borrowed them from her! \NOf course my prints are on them!
0.5;The fingerprints of the \Nman handing out tissues!
0.5;His prints could only have gotten \Non the books when he picked them up
0.5;It's also unnatural for Suda-san to \Nsuddenly feel tired after eating cake.
0.5;You made the metal bat appear \Nto be the murder weapon,
0.5;and turned yourself in at \Nthe police station at 11:30.
0.5;so the police investigation \Nwould remove suspicion from you.

0.5;forced its mouth open,\Nand had it bite down as if it had attacked.
0.5;I see. You pretended to play\Ndumb but actually saw through it all.

0.5;It's natural for lovers to want\Nto know the other's true feelings.

0.5;Kiwako-san pretended to drown\Nto test Masahiko-san, her fiancé.
0.5;To see if he would come to her rescue,\Neven though he can't swim.
0.5;As proof, she murmured this\Nafter confirming that he tried to help...
0.5;But they're getting married\Nnext week. Why do that now?
0.5;She was irritated that\Nher fiancé didn't even bat an eye
0.5;For the plan to work, someone had to\Ntell Masahiko-san right away.
0.5;It'd be a disgrace if someone\Nelse on the beach rescued her first.
0.5;The signal for the start of the\Nplan was probably when she said...
0.5;Could you get a fresh\Nbeach towel from our room?
0.5;...Is something else she said,\Nso that sounds about right.
0.5;But Harumi-san tried to\Nstop her from going into the water!
0.5;You don't have to do it today.\NCan't you go tomorrow?
0.5;But Kiwako-san continued\Nwith the plan anyway.
0.5;Unaware that Harumi-san\Nhad another, more sinister plan in store.
0.5;Upon returning to her\Nroom to get the bath towel,
0.5;Then, at the proper time,\Nshe signaled Kiwako-san to falsely drown.
0.5;Then, when rushing\Nto help with everyone else,
0.5;she took out the hidden sea\Nsnake and had it bite Kiwako-san.
0.5;The murder weapon is gracefully\Nswimming in the Pacific Ocean.
0.5;Without a weapon,\Nthis case won't stand up in court.

0.5;That way, she could pull it\Nout and have it bite in an instant.
0.5;Then the wing-like things\NI saw on the snake were...
0.5;The rest of the tape is\Nprobably still inside her pouch.

0.5;But why would she harm Kiwako-san?!\NShe's her brother's fiancée!
0.5;Don't be silly, Dad! She and\NMasahiko-san are brother and sister!
0.5;Especially given that she's\Nthe same age as Kiwako-san.
0.5;Then they're step-siblings\Nfrom when their parents remarried?
0.5;"Seeing as Hiroshi-san calls her\N""-san"" even though she's younger,"

0.5;Besides, didn't he accidentally \Nfall from the bridge?
0.5;and while the dead man was \Ndistracted, you pushed him off.
0.5;You experimented numerous \Ntimes at the riverbed,
0.5;to see how the boomerang would \Nshine and how it would fly.
0.5;The people who saw that \Nstarted saying it was a UFO.
0.5;Besides, why would I go \Nthrough all that trouble
0.5;Besides, your shoulders hurt, \Nso you can't lift your arms.
0.5;You had to lift his legs while \Nhe was distracted by something.
0.5;His pants didn't have any grime \Nfrom the railing on them.
0.5;That proves he was holding the \Nrailing and leaning out over it.
0.5;I would never do anything as \Nviolent as killing a person.
0.5;There aren't any shops that sell \Nthese boomerangs these days.
0.5;It's natural to think they fell \Nif a person died at a bridge!
0.5;He drank too much scotch \Nand accidentally fell!
0.5;How did you know the victim \Nwas drinking scotch?
0.5;The police don't think it was \Nan accidental death, either.
0.5;On top of that, if they find \Nthe gear in his shoe...
0.5;My wife was in the hospital \Na long time for her sickness.
0.5;The man who fell from the \Nbridge was a debt collector.
0.5;But I didn't mind, no matter \Nwhat he did to me.
0.5;went to my wife in the hospital \Nand demanded repayment.
0.5;My wife became despondent, and \Nher condition suddenly worsened.
0.5;The culprit stood on that so \Nthey could pick up the engine.
0.5;Those are the footprints \Nof a boy's athletic shoes.
0.5;The remaining three boys are \Nall wearing athletic shoes.
0.5;But the dirt on the stool \Nis damp and viscous.
0.5;You wouldn't have needed the \Nstool to get the engine.
0.5;If something's broken, \Nyou just have to fix it.
0.5;My late wife used to talk \Nabout that day all the time.
0.5;You haven't changed at \Nall since ten years ago.
0.5;You went awfully easy on \Nthe culprit this time.
0.5;Takagi-kun, go to Nagai-san's \Nstore immediately.
0.5;Maybe I shouldn't ask, but \Nwhy did you turn yourself in?
0.5;a mysterious boy who hadn't changed \Nat all since ten years ago.
0.5;Doesn't this forest seem like there \Nwould actually be zombies out there?
0.5;that turns zombies to ash \Nat the slightest touch.

0.5;The murder that took place at \Nthe new Nichiuri TV building
0.5;Hattori Heiji and I assisted \Nthe police investigation,
0.5;and uncovered the terrifying truth \Nthe true culprit had plotted.

0.5;Which means in the presence \Nof the final man...
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;The climax will have you \Non the edge of your seat!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;It was already nighttime, \Nand they were at a hospital.
0.5;Well, you know, I have \Nto look after the kids.
0.5;You've got to consider \NKudo-kun's feelings, too.
0.5;I'm going to get the part \Nand shake Gomera's hand!
0.5;I'll get the others. Let's go \Nto Abeno Harukas together.
0.5;The Hyogo police already conducted a \Nthorough investigation, so it's not that easy.
0.5;We've learned that what we thought was a team \Nof four robbers was actually a team of five.
0.5;Not only that, but it's possible a bomb has \Nbeen planted in the vicinity of the fifth man!
0.5;After all, the bombs you made are killing \Nyour old accomplices one after another.
0.5;I think it'd be best if you gave \Nyourself up and talked to the police.
0.5;You've got your last \Naccomplice to worry about.
0.5;So wouldn't it be planted near \Nyour surviving accomplice?
0.5;It'd be better to talk to the \Npolice and have him taken into—
0.5;This is Suzuki. He'll be \Nrunning today's event.
0.5;Didn't you MC the production \Nannouncement event, too?
0.5;Yes. I'm terribly sorry about \Neverything that happened then.
0.5;Chief, we've confirmed \Nthere were five robbers.
0.5;The Hyogo police knew there was \Na left-handed man in the group,
0.5;All right. Search their \Nassociates for left-handed men.
0.5;It's me, Katsuji.\NYou're in there, aren't you?
0.5;Koichi went missing after he \Nleft the orphanage at sixteen.
0.5;Koichi seriously injured his right \Nleg in a fight when he was fifteen,
0.5;I don't know! If I stay here, the \Npolice will come for me eventually.
0.5;I've got my hands full \Nevading debt collectors!
0.5;"Thank you for coming to the \N""Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba"""
0.5;and please refrain from \Ntaking pictures or videos.
0.5;If I'd known this would happen,\NI would've gone into work instead.
0.5;Yonekura asked me to work \Nsecurity at an event for him.
0.5;I think it was a movie production \Nannouncement or something.
0.5;He said there'd be kaiju \Nballoons or something,
0.5;There are numbers written on \Nthe weights of the balloons.
0.5;He told me to stand between \Nnumbers 26 and 27.
0.5;The bombs are probably in the \Nweights of those two balloons.
0.5;I wish we could, but if people find out \Nabout the bombs, it could cause a panic.
0.5;In other words, we have to do something \Nuntil the bomb squad arrives.
0.5;Thanks to your cheers, Yaiba was able \Nto defeat Jocker's monster!
0.5;In that case, could you check to see if \Nballoons have been placed anywhere else?
0.5;One Gomera and one Yaiba balloon have \Nbeen moved to the stage on floor 58!
0.5;"If I'm given the opportunity to appear \Nin ""Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba""..."
0.5;But if things get dangerous \Nhere, you'd better run.
0.5;Due to technical difficulties, \Nwe'll be taking a break now.
0.5;We'll be holding a handshake event with \NGomera and Yaiba in the elevator hall.
0.5;A bomb has been planted \Non that stage you're on.
0.5;If we don't get in line \Nsoon, we'll be too late.
0.5;There's a bomb inside the weight that \Nhas the number 27 written on it.
0.5;The surrounding wires are bypasses,\Nso she just needs to cut them in order.
0.5;What do you think will happen to the other \Nguests if a bomb goes off right now?
0.5;Otaki-han and the others \Nare headed there now,
0.5;I need to deal with the bomb \Nhere, so I can't go to you.
0.5;Just like I thought, it's \Nthe same as this one.
0.5;Kazuha, there should be small scissors \Nin the sewing kit you carry with you.
0.5;I'll try cutting mine first. If \Nnothing happens, you cut yours, too.
0.5;see the tube connected to the blue wire \Nbeing held up by some plastic rods?
0.5;Remove the dangling tube without \Ntouching the surrounding tube,
0.5;First we'll unscrew the plastic \Nrods supporting it, and...
0.5;Is there anything in the area \Nthat you could use instead?
0.5;There's nothing that convenient \Njust lying around...
0.5;It's a famous unsolved case \Nfrom the 19th Century.
0.5;If I remember right, a crew of ten \Npeople disappeared into thin air,
0.5;Get it together! Can you \Ntell me what happened?
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""The Mystery of the Michelin \NStarred Restaurant!"""
0.5;Can we ask you a few \Nquestions, Kuchiishi-san?
0.5;Now, there were five guests \Nat that table? You're certain?
0.5;It was a group from a company \Ncalled Onda Trading.
0.5;It's about the identities \Nof the missing group.
0.5;We confirmed his ID from his driver's \Nlicense, which was left behind.
0.5;We confirmed the guy next to him \Nfrom the employee ID in his jacket,
0.5;Next to him was a floral handkerchief \Nand a bag containing an employee ID
0.5;The seat with the ash tray next to \Nher belonged to Sahara Takuro-san,
0.5;We gathered that from the cigarettes \Nand employee ID in his coat pocket.
0.5;The last one we put together from \Nthe smart phone that was left behind.
0.5;Kuchiishi-san, can you \Nconfirm they're who you saw?
0.5;We haven't been able to \Ncontact President Onda,
0.5;so we had local police check \Non his home to be safe.
0.5;When we came in, there was \Na picture on the phone...
0.5;but apparently the five of them \Nwould go out a lot together,
0.5;and I went into the kitchen \Nto continue cooking.
0.5;And then after about fifteen minutes, \NI was struck from out of nowhere.
0.5;It certainly sounds like someone from that \Ngroup was the one to strike you...
0.5;Did someone break their glass \Nwhen they did the toast?
0.5;I would've noticed if they did, \Nnot to mention having to clean up.
0.5;You can't just run around \Non your own, you know?
0.5;the company was under suspicion \Nfor smuggling industrial metals,
0.5;But one of the other managers left a note \Nclaiming they were responsible for all of it,
0.5;Then the five employees from this \Nincident might've been involved?
0.5;Sir, you really shouldn't \Ndo this sort of thing...
0.5;Did he walk into the lake, \Nlike the five customers?
0.5;Is it really okay that I'm the \Nonly one not searching the lake?
0.5;Inspector Megure told me \Nthat Detective Chiba
0.5;was going to check out the \Nlake with the local police.
0.5;Did Mori-san really tell \Nus to look around here?
0.5;So this is a warehouse \Nthat Kuchiishi-san owns.
0.5;Kogoro-no-ojisan said that even \Nthat wound on his head
0.5;No, manipulate him into committing \Nsuicide, and taking the fall!
0.5;You're Onda Teruaki, president \Nof Onda Trading, correct?
0.5;If you're here now, that means \Nyou've solved the mystery, right?
0.5;We're only here because you told us \Nwhere to rescue the missing five people,
0.5;We rescued them from where \Nthey were being held,
0.5;It had a few similarities \Nwith a famous unsolved case,
0.5;the first thing I thought \Nwas weird was the tiramisu.
0.5;It was the dessert at the seat with the \Nlady who had the flowery handkerchief!
0.5;It was dinnertime when \Neverybody went missing,
0.5;But it wasn't Ekuni-san, \Nrather Iketani-san, a man.
0.5;you might have a seating \Npattern that tends to pop up.
0.5;And this time, the pictures \Nindicated that was the case.
0.5;It was all to make Mori \NKogoro notice something...
0.5;it shows a route to the warehouse where \Nthe kidnapped people were being held.
0.5;"These ""curse"" notes were \Nanother part of the puzzle."
0.5;At first I thought the five of them \Nwere captured at the restaurant,
0.5;then moved to the warehouse, \Nwhere they were locked up.
0.5;If that were the case, the five of them \Nwould've been sitting in the same positions as usual,
0.5;with a broken piece of glass that \Nhad no explanation at the time.
0.5;There was no sign of a broken glass or a \Nbottle in the restaurant's garbage, either.
0.5;But the hood of the car that was parked \Noutside was still giving off heat,
0.5;President Onda, you've all been \Npartying in a variety of locations,
0.5;The pictures in the phone included \Nrestaurants, the roofs of skyscrapers,
0.5;the summits of mountains, beaches, \Nand even deserted islands.
0.5;to lure them to a warehouse \Nwith little trouble,
0.5;and get them to start \Ntoasting among themselves.
0.5;and the wine on the jacket in \Nthe restaurant are the same,
0.5;There was also an e-mail from that \Npresident guy asking them all to show up.
0.5;That's because it was \NKuchiishi-san who sent it.
0.5;Once they were unconscious, \Nhe took their shoes,
0.5;and returned to the restaurant \Nin the car they arrived with.
0.5;as if they had been there all \Nalong, and served up the food.
0.5;After that, he made the foot prints leading \Nto the lake through the back door
0.5;to make it look like they \Nhad drowned themselves,
0.5;and then hurt himself while \Nwaiting for us to arrive.
0.5;By the way, those notes \Nwere actually a message
0.5;to President Onda using your \Nfather's name, weren't they?
0.5;"If you take the ""kuchi"" kanji from \NKuchiishi and the ""ani"" from Keigo..."
0.5;Might it have been a signature \Nyour father used in the past?
0.5;In other words, the son of \NKuchiishi Keigo-san, Eigo-san,
0.5;But the truth was, he was luring President \NOnda into a trap by making him cautious.
0.5;because they recognized the \Nman who had confined them.
0.5;And after thinking about what \Ntheir president would do next...
0.5;They prove that Eigo-san's late \Nfather was innocent, don't they?
0.5;And for the record, I am not \Ngoing down with this ship!
0.5;Yeah. I'm don't want to \Nend up like him, either.
0.5;They likely had no idea \Nthey were in the restaurant
0.5;And realized my father can't rest \Nuntil I expose their crimes,
0.5;And that if I was the ace detective \Nthat my reputation suggests,
0.5;I'd be able to figure out the \Ncase from the clues he left,
0.5;The next day, the secret \Nbooks were evidence enough
0.5;to get President Onda and the \Ncomplicit five employees arrested,
0.5;"That was a Michelin-starred restaurant; \Nthose are hard to get reservations for."
0.5;Maybe Cucina Eigo will \Nopen up again someday...
0.5;That was the dark horse! This \Npays out a hundred-fold!
0.5;All right, tonight we're having \Nsushi for dinner, sushi!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The Tokyo-Style \NDetective Show Next Door, Part One!"""
0.5;According to police, the \Nvictim Katsui Masaru
0.5;We already started eating \Nsince you woke up so late.
0.5;Apparently they arrested \Nthe killer in the murder
0.5;had been demanding money \Nfrom suspect Hirose Junko,
0.5;The suspect appears to \Nhave admitted to her crime,
0.5;and is currently being \Nheld at Tonkoro Station,
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;When the old man sees a \Nbeautiful suspect on TV,
0.5;What's did you want to discuss \Nthat's so important, Mori-kun?
0.5;First, could you tell me the \Nsequence of events of the case?
0.5;we believed the suspect \Nwas one of his victims.
0.5;As we were questioning \Nour list of suspects...
0.5;she had motive and seemed \Nto admit she had done it.
0.5;If the time this watch is stopped \Nat is the time of the murder,
0.5;Around 8 PM that night, \Nshe was in Beika City.
0.5;to drive from Beika City \Nto the crime scene.
0.5;More importantly, why did you \Nlie about killing Katsui?
0.5;then I was willing to \Ntake the blame for them.
0.5;But giving false testimony is an \Ninterference of public duties.
0.5;We're also at fault for being \Ntoo hasty in making an arrest.
0.5;Hirose Junko-san seems like \Na strange person, though.
0.5;Why would she take responsibility \Nfor a murder she didn't commit?
0.5;Maybe the actual time \Nof the murder was different.
0.5;Maybe the killer adjusted the time \Non his watch after killing him.
0.5;there would've been no need to hide \Nthe actual time of the murder.
0.5;We may be able to figure \Nout why Hirose-san
0.5;In that case, you should look into \Nher connections to Beika City.
0.5;she didn't have the expression of someone \Non their way to eat, drink, and be merry.
0.5;We need to know why she \Nreally came to Beika City.
0.5;And I thought it would be the \Nbest way to find the true killer.
0.5;This is where they found \NKatsui Masaru's body.
0.5;I'm surprised they found a body \Nin such a well-concealed area.
0.5;We're assuming the victim \Nwas killed around 8 PM
0.5;because his watch was \Nstopped at that time, right?
0.5;That matches the time of death \Ndetermined by the autopsy,
0.5;Then if she had hurried \Nback to Tonkoro City
0.5;after being spotted in Beika City around \Neight, she would've arrived around nine.
0.5;and made it seem as though \Nhe'd been killed at eight.
0.5;Like another witness who \Nhappened to see her.
0.5;Is there any evidence that \Npoints to the true killer?
0.5;Katsui bought two packs of \Ncigarettes at the station,
0.5;But if it's just barely possible \Nthat she could've done it—
0.5;Maybe she was actually \Nvisiting him the other night.
0.5;have someone besides \Nyou to verify her alibi.
0.5;Then wouldn't she have told the \Npolice about Matsubayashi-san
0.5;why Hirose-san pretended \Nto be the murderer!
0.5;That night, Hirose-san went \Nto see Matsubayashi-san.
0.5;She went to get rid of old \Nmementos still left there.
0.5;the police would've tried to confirm \Nher story with Matsubayashi-san.
0.5;His fiancée would think \Nhe was up to something.
0.5;And his fiancée is the daughter \Nof an executive at his company.
0.5;because she didn't want to put \NMatsubayashi-san through that.
0.5;Even if it meant being convicted \Nof a crime she didn't commit,
0.5;she wanted to protect \NMatsubayashi-san's happiness.
0.5;Pretending to be the murderer \Nwas Hirose-san's last gift
0.5;Your theory that she tried to use \Nher ex to fabricate her alibi.
0.5;And I doubt he would've agreed \Nto verify Hirose-san's alibi,
0.5;In other words, she couldn't have \Nused him to fabricate an alibi.
0.5;If that's true, then there \Nmust be some trace of it.
0.5;Yes, because of the awful \Nthings she went through,
0.5;Mori-san, we examined this \Nthing Conan-kun brought us.
0.5;Did you run out of patience, \NHirose Junko-san?
0.5;ran after an executive's daughter \Nso he could marry into money.
0.5;When Katsui Masaru demanded \Nmoney from you again,
0.5;you decided to remove the \Nobnoxious blackmailer
0.5;If you could use a murder \Nfor another purpose,
0.5;Just after seven on the \Nnight of the incident,
0.5;While you were using an excuse to \Nget into Matsubayashi-san's home,
0.5;At eight, after you left \NMatsubayashi-san's home
0.5;Then you led Katsui Masaru \Nto the crime scene,
0.5;You set his watch to eight and \Nbroke it, stopping the watch.
0.5;When they came to question you, \Nyou confessed to the crime.
0.5;that Hirose-san was arrested \Nfor murder, didn't you?
0.5;And that the time of the crime \Nwas 8 PM on Friday night.
0.5;as though he allowed an \Ninnocent woman to fall.
0.5;she would've gotten out in a \Nrelatively short amount of time.
0.5;How could you let me fall \Nwhen I was innocent?
0.5;The reason you made us believe the \Nmurder was committed at eight
0.5;the selfish man who dumped \Nyou, one last gift.
0.5;Your only miscalculation \Nwas the appearance
0.5;of a second person who \Ncould verify your alibi.
0.5;You were considering how \Nto handle my testimony.
0.5;Though you'd be unable to get \Nyour revenge on Matsubayashi-san,
0.5;Detective Takagi, please \Nexplain the situation.
0.5;Inside this plastic bag \Nwere ten cigarette butts
0.5;And we found Hirose Junko-san's \Nfingerprints on this bag.
0.5;In other words, Katsui \Nwas waiting in your home
0.5;Hirose Junko-san, could \Nyou come with us, please?
0.5;When the details of Hirose-san's \Ncrime are reported,
0.5;what will your fiancée and \Nher father think of you?

0.5;I watched Vodka,\Na man dressed in black,

0.5;Only you could ever solve\Nthat difficult case!
0.5;Have you forgotten our promise to\Nnever speak of that incident again?!
0.5;Return to your rooms\Nand get ready to sleep!
0.5;Detective.\NI will let you stay the night,
0.5;Do you really think\Nkappa and oni really exist?
0.5;Tengus are the same--\Nimaginary creatures invented by people.
0.5;referred to shooting stars that\Nmade loud, thunder-like sounds
0.5;"as ""Heavenly Dogs,""\Nor Tengu, thus the name."
0.5;In China, such shooting stars\Nwere considered unlucky omens.
0.5;and Tengus changed from strange\Nphenomenon to strange monsters!
0.5;For a little runt you sure\Nknow lots of weird things.
0.5;I, uh, saw it on a\NTV show the other day...
0.5;Don't be silly,\NI'm not afraid of anything!
0.5;If you get scared during the night,\Nyou can come sleep with me!
0.5;He kidnaps only young\Ngirls who have tender meat!
0.5;Stupid Ran, waking us up in\Nthe middle of the night!
0.5;What's the big deal?! I can't\Nhelp that I'm a scaredy-cat!
0.5;He doesn't want to talk about\Nit, so it's best not to ask.
0.5;As if the Kiri Tengu\Nwould actually appear...
0.5;I shouldn't have brought this!\NNow what do I do?
0.5;You shouldn't have\Nput it on in the first place!
0.5;You didn't get much\Nsleep either, Mokunen-san?
0.5;But that's nothing compared\Nto Tonnen, he hasn't slept at all.
0.5;Where are the head\Npriest and Kannen-san?
0.5;We haven't seen the head priest,\Nso Kannen went to look for him...
0.5;He's probably in a room\Nsomewhere downing some sake--
0.5;It sounded like it came\Nfrom the meditation room!
0.5;The victim was this\Ntemple's head priest, Tenei.
0.5;He died approximately between\N10:00 pm and 12:00 am last night.
0.5;And you were the\None who found his body.
0.5;We didn't see him this morning,\Nso I went to look for him.
0.5;And then I found him\Nin this meditation room...
0.5;And by yet another\Nstrange coincidence,
0.5;the person who rushed\Nhere after the scream was--
0.5;You have really keen senses,\Ndon't you, Kannen-san?
0.5;that he was hanging\Nfrom the roof, did you?
0.5;The exact same thing happened\Nin this room two years ago...
0.5;I believe the one who died was\Na priest-in-training named Chunen.
0.5;And it was Kannen-san and\NMokunen-san who found the body, right?
0.5;It happened during\Nthe rainy season...
0.5;After coming into\Nthis room to meditate,
0.5;Chunen tore a big hole\Nin the wall and disappeared.
0.5;We looked for three days\Nand three nights,
0.5;I came into this room\Nwith Kannen to fix the wall.
0.5;...there was Chunen-san,\Nhanging from the ceiling!
0.5;Is this hole the same\Nplace that was broken last time?
0.5;At first, we thought that\NChunen-san made it to escape,
0.5;but the door to\Nthis room wasn't locked,
0.5;and a local carpenter\Nwho came to fix the outer wall
0.5;said it would take an entire day\Nfor a person to make a hole that big!
0.5;He said the only\Nthing that could have done it
0.5;The two side beams\Nare covered in dust,
0.5;and there are no signs of\Nanything touching them.
0.5;A bit of dust has been\Nknocked off the middle beam,
0.5;but that's because of\Nthe rope tied to it.
0.5;There are no rub marks to\Nindicate he was hoisted up.
0.5;Do you suppose\Nthis was a suicide too?
0.5;Yeah, you can manage\Nto get up there
0.5;if you climb across the beams\Nand use rope like that officer,
0.5;but it's a different story if you're\Ntrying to carry someone up there.
0.5;The late priest Chunen and the\Nhead priest weren't all that small.
0.5;Scaling the rope with them tied to\Nyour back would be nigh impossible.
0.5;If you tied the noose around\Ntheir necks and hoisted them up,
0.5;Someone could have climbed\Nup first and then pulled them up,
0.5;but that narrow beam is\Nthe only place to stand,
0.5;and then jumped off with\Nthe noose around their necks.
0.5;Some leftover rope and an axe\Nprobably used to cut it
0.5;But what has me wondering\Nis that hole in the wall...
0.5;I don't know how\Nthey broke the wall,
0.5;but they probably broke it and\Nhanged themselves from a tall ceiling
0.5;that they were attacked\Nby the flying Kiri Tengu.
0.5;That ridiculous tale sends\Neveryone in a panic...
0.5;But doesn't this broken\Nwall seem strange?
0.5;For such a big hole in the wall,\Nthere's almost no debris left.
0.5;After all, these people\Ndid make their suicides
0.5;The head priest's\Ngranddaughter, Kikuno-san.
0.5;Yes. She used to visit on\Noccasion back then,
0.5;but she suddenly stopped\Ncoming after the incident...
0.5;and the two of them were arranged\Nto be married since they were little.
0.5;I was really shocked when I heard\Nthat from the head priest two years ago.
0.5;It must have been a\Nreal shock to Chunen-san
0.5;when he heard she\Nwas going to be married.
0.5;That's probably why\Nhe did that foolish thing...
0.5;Maybe the head priest had been\Nworrying about that this whole time--
0.5;If so, then there should be\Na will somewhere.
0.5;Then let's all split up\Nand look for it!
0.5;No matter how much\Nit looks like the old legend,
0.5;would anybody really hang\Nthemselves from a place like that?!
0.5;And would they really\Nmake such a big hole on purpose?!
0.5;and this big hole was\Nused for some sort of trick...
0.5;This incident and the one two years\Nago were pulled off the same way.
0.5;Meaning Chunen and the head priest\Nwere murdered by the same person.
0.5;Come to think of it, this guy said\Nhe came to this temple one year ago.
0.5;I doubt he could've made that\Nbig hole with these scrawny arms...
0.5;Say, you said you were up\Nlate last night reading a book, right?
0.5;Yeah. I was awake\Nuntil a little past 3:00.
0.5;Did you notice anything\Nstrange during that time?
0.5;Like anyone sneaking\Nout of their room,
0.5;or an eerie sound\Nfrom something breaking,
0.5;but everyone's sleeping\Nquarters are next to each other,
0.5;Don't tell me you're\Nsuspicious of everyone?
0.5;Stop lounging\Naround and help us look!
0.5;You freaked me out when\Nyou started to lose your grip there!
0.5;That's the window\Nat the top of the room
0.5;You can't carry someone\Nthrough here onto the middle beam?
0.5;Besides, it'd be crazy\Nto carry someone in there
0.5;and try to do things on\Ntop of something so narrow.
0.5;There are cherry blossom\Npetals stuck to the underside...
0.5;he asked how to get to\Nthe woods below the temple
0.5;The only things\Nmissing from the scene
0.5;were the fragments\Nfrom that broken wall!
0.5;I might figure out the reason\Nthe killer had to get rid of them!
0.5;And then the mystery\Nbehind the killer's trick!
0.5;That's okay. At least\Nwe know it was a suicide...
0.5;Something happened\Nin this room last night!
0.5;The wall which was destroyed\Nby an immense strength...
0.5;And the dumped\Npiece of wood from the wall
0.5;What is the key\Nthat connects them all?
0.5;That's it! I've figured\Nout the killer's trick!
0.5;If that's the case, then the killer must've\Nspent the entire night in this room...
0.5;...a work of foul art created at\Nthe scene of the crime by a murderer.
0.5;was a room in a mountain temple\Nwhere the cherry blossoms fall.
0.5;Someone murdered\Nthe temple's head priest
0.5;by tying him to an elevated\Nbeam and then hanging him!
0.5;Naturally, there were no\Nmarks of him being pulled up.
0.5;It seems utterly impossible for\Na human to commit this crime...
0.5;Yes, the killer utilized a certain\Ntechnique to float in the air!
0.5;Some unused rope\Nand an axe lay on the floor
0.5;of the room where\Nthe head priest was killed.
0.5;was that although there\Nwas a huge hole in the wall,
0.5;and the piece of\Nwood from the sliding panel
0.5;What is the key\Nthat connects them all?
0.5;That's it! I've figured\Nout the killer's trick!
0.5;then the killer must've spent\Nthe entire night in this room!
0.5;I have to make them\Nnotice before everyone leaves...
0.5;Hand over the\Nkeys to the rental car
0.5;that just happened to\Nget a flat tire in the forest!
0.5;I'll have one of my\Nmen return it for you.
0.5;We owe a great deal\Nto your detective skills, after all.
0.5;Oops, he slipped\Nand knocked himself out...
0.5;Now I don't have to use the\NAnesthetic Watch Gun on him!
0.5;This button acts as\Na tiny wireless speaker.
0.5;You shouldn't come in\Nhere without permission.
0.5;Mori-san said he wants\Neveryone to gather in the room
0.5;I know who killed the head\Npriest and made it look like a suicide.
0.5;The head priest died after\Nhe was tied to an elevated beam
0.5;There were no marks on the beam\Nof him being pulled up, you know!
0.5;The killer floated directly up to\Nthe beam along with the head priest
0.5;Don't tell me it\Nwas the Kiri Tengu...
0.5;Yes. The waterfall that flows\Ndirectly next to the top window...
0.5;Wouldn't it be possible\Nto float to the ceiling
0.5;if you diverted the waterfall\Nthrough the window
0.5;Both the killer and the\Nvictim would be sopping wet,
0.5;but there were no signs\Nof wetness on the body at all!
0.5;You said there was an inflatable\Nraft in the temple, correct?
0.5;If the body was in the raft and covered\Nwith a plastic sheet or something,
0.5;then it could have made it\Nto the top without getting wet.
0.5;But the waterfall and\Nthe window are too far apart!
0.5;nobody could divert\Nthe water into the room...
0.5;The killer covered the gaps in\Nthe drainboard with tape, flipped it over,
0.5;and then redirected the\Nwaterfall through the window.
0.5;As proof of this, the cut\Non the drainboard is warped.
0.5;It was cut to make\Nit short enough to fit...
0.5;And there are cherry blossom\Npetals stuck to the board
0.5;in the spots where\Nthe tape would have been...
0.5;The same petals that\Nare carried down the waterfall
0.5;from the trees at\Nthe top of the mountain.
0.5;And it wasn't just the drainboard\Nthat had flower petals stuck to it.
0.5;They should fall down\Nto your feet soon, Inspector.
0.5;The petals that got\Nstuck to the side of the wall
0.5;when the killer removed\Nthe water, that is!
0.5;In other words,\Nafter killing the head priest,
0.5;the killer carried\Nthe body into this room,
0.5;and temporarily left the\Nroom through the sliding panel.
0.5;Then the killer began\Nfilling the room with water
0.5;from the 2nd floor window\Nusing the method I just illustrated,
0.5;Otherwise, the water\Nwould leak out through the panel.
0.5;After that, while taking\Ngreat care not to get the body wet,
0.5;all the killer had to do\Nwas wait for the room to fill up.
0.5;After the room filled up enough,\Nthe killer arrived at the beam,
0.5;By breaking the\Nsliding panel with the axe
0.5;Yes. This room's floor\Nis about 4.5 tatami in area
0.5;and the walls are\Nabout 10 meters high,
0.5;so its volume is 2.7 meters\Nby 2.7 meters by 10 meters,
0.5;so the weight of all the water in\Nthe filled room would be 72.9 tons.
0.5;If you used an axe to break\Na panel at the bottom of a room
0.5;The cracked panel would fly out under\N9.8 x 10 to the 4th Pascals of pressure!
0.5;Under the immense\Nstrength of the water,
0.5;more and more of the wall would\Nerode off, creating a gaping hole!
0.5;A huge amount of power--\Nlike getting run over by a truck.
0.5;Conan found a fragment of the\Nwall in the woods below the temple.
0.5;A piece of the sliding\Npanel with tape on it.
0.5;But who in the world\Nwould do such a thing?!
0.5;It would take less than ten seconds\Nfor the water to exit the room,
0.5;but filling the room,\Nthat's a whole different story.
0.5;is five to six times as\Nmuch as through a faucet.
0.5;If we estimate that it filled\Nup 10 cubic meters per hour,
0.5;it would take seven hours\Nto completely fill this room!
0.5;The head priest's\Nestimated time of death
0.5;was between 10:00 pm\Nand 12:00 am last night.
0.5;And it was 8:00 am when\Nhis body was discovered.
0.5;Even if you deduct the\Ntime to set up the trick
0.5;and the time needed to release\Nthe water and dry the room
0.5;the killer must have been in this\Nroom between midnight and 6:00 am!
0.5;What does that have\Nto do with the killer?
0.5;If so, then you too should've\Nheard a certain someone scream
0.5;when they saw the\NTengu mask from the bathroom!
0.5;I can't blame her\Nfor being scared, though...
0.5;But it's not your\Nfault you didn't hear me.
0.5;surrounded by the thunderous\Nroar of the water, after all.
0.5;But his testimony won't\Nhold as evidence, Mori-kun!
0.5;If it's undeniable\Nproof that you want,
0.5;then you're holding\Nit right now, Inspector.
0.5;By wiping the room off later,\Nthe killer could destroy the evidence,
0.5;but he couldn't do\Nthat with that piece of wood
0.5;That is the only thing\Nthe killer failed to recover!
0.5;But Shunen came to\Nthis temple a year ago!
0.5;If this is the same trick\Nas the one two years ago,
0.5;The incident two years ago\Nwas probably the head priest's doing,
0.5;and he was the one most\Nafraid to talk about the incident.
0.5;the late Chunen-san and\NShunen-san were probably brothers!
0.5;It was only natural\Nthat no one realized it...
0.5;To hide my origin,\NI came as a priest-in-training
0.5;after studying at a\Ndistantly-related temple first.
0.5;Naturally, my purpose\Nfor coming to this temple
0.5;was to find out the truth\Nbehind my brother's death
0.5;I had the trick figured out,\Nbut I didn't know who did it.
0.5;Nobody wanted to talk about\Nthe incident, you see.
0.5;But I realized it when you\Ncame yesterday, Detective.
0.5;I knew once I saw the\Nhead priest's strange attitude!
0.5;Afterwards, I went to his room\Nand found him drinking his night sake.
0.5;When I pressed the issue,\Nhe told me about all sorts of things!
0.5;He had no idea I was actually\NChunen's younger brother!
0.5;was because he didn't want him\Nto take his granddaughter Kikuno-san,
0.5;who was to marry a\Nsuccessor to a big temple.
0.5;Kikuno-san and my brother supposedly\Neven agreed to elope together,
0.5;Anyway, when I asked the head\Npriest to give himself up, he--
0.5;There's no evidence left from what\Nhappened two years ago anyway!
0.5;Besides, this temple has gained\Nprestige thanks to that incident!
0.5;It's known as the temple\Nwhere the Kiri Tengu appears!
0.5;When he said that,\NI lost control of myself
0.5;and strangled him to\Ndeath with a belt in the room!
0.5;Yes. Just like he strangled my\Nbrother two years ago...
0.5;to leave marks to make\Nit look like a hanging suicide...
0.5;With his corpse at my feet,\NI had no other choice.
0.5;It's too bad you didn't visit this\Ntemple two years ago, Detective.
0.5;You surprise me \Nevery single time, Mori-kun!
0.5;I had no idea you knew\Nthat much about physics!
0.5;Yeah, like when you talked\Nabout Pascals or something...
0.5;Though, I guess it wasn't the actual \NRed Woman who attacked us.
0.5;if Inspector Yamato and Inspector \NMorofushi hadn't arrived?
0.5;I think we could've easily \Nsubdued her without them.
0.5;When I was little, I was \Nall about jeet kune do.
0.5;I'd watch and copy the videos my oldest \Nbrother sent me until they wore out.
0.5;I sometimes played other \Nsports with my friends.
0.5;I used to watch a lot of \Nsports with my mom on TV.
0.5;That's how I know Conan-kun's \Npretty good at football.
0.5;Because of that, I've been living alone \Nin a hotel since I returned to Japan.
0.5;Are you sure you're not the \Ndaughter of some rich family?
0.5;I don't have any other \Nrelatives to depend on.
0.5;Once I get older, I know \NI should pay him back.
0.5;If she has two brothers and doesn't \Nknow any of her relatives,
0.5;then who is that young girl I saw on \Nher phone who looks just like her?
0.5;I made my brother agree to meet me to\Ndiscuss the Red Woman case in person.
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;A popular author is confined \Nto his room in a hotel.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;The Romance Novel with the \NUnexpected Conclusion, Part One!
0.5;It's still shorter than my family's\NBell Tree Tower, though.
0.5;Apparently they're waiting for manuscripts \Nfrom a popular author living in this hotel.
0.5;"Right now I'm really into ""The \NPhone, the Ocean, and I."""
0.5;No wonder so many people were \Ncoming in and out of your room.
0.5;I'd like to thank you for \Neverything you do for me.
0.5;We'll measure your weight \Nbefore and after you eat.
0.5;I have pizza, Chinese, \Nand donuts coming later.
0.5;so I can't sneak out of this \Nroom to commit any mischief.
0.5;If you want to see my dirty underwear, \Nyou're welcome to go in there.
0.5;Hey, why don't we order something \Nfrom room service like that author?
0.5;As promised, I'll finish the manuscripts \Nof whoever ate the most first.
0.5;but recently he's been as \Npopular as he used to be.
0.5;She got a room just below \NHiura-sensei's today, too.
0.5;It's probably tough for her to \Ncome up while we're all here.
0.5;A weekly magazine just wrote an \Narticle saying they might be lovers.
0.5;It said to get his new \Nassistant away from him.
0.5;I guess his female fans \Nare still in good health.
0.5;Talking about relationships at \Nan all girls afternoon tea party.
0.5;Maybe one about a girl you \Nonce met who you can't forget?
0.5;The funicular marks on her neck suggest \Nshe was strangled by some kind of rope.
0.5;Minazuki-kun was collapsed \Nin the doorway of her room...
0.5;M-Maybe it has something\Nto do with that fax.
0.5;It said we'd regret it if we \Ndidn't fire his assistant.
0.5;A-Are you saying I was working on a romance \Nnovel while this was happening to her?
0.5;When you came to deliver the \Nchampagne that was ordered,
0.5;The key card was stuck in the \Ndoor and it was slightly ajar.
0.5;I wondered what had happened, \Nso I opened the door.
0.5;I'm occupying the room \Ndirectly above this one.
0.5;I was writing, but I thought I \Nwould be finished around 6 o'clock.
0.5;I never imagined this would happen \Nto her while I was writing.
0.5;Did you come here because \Nyou finished writing?
0.5;No, I was having trouble \Nfinishing the last pages.
0.5;I went out to buy cigarettes for a change \Nof pace and wander around while thinking.
0.5;I bought cigarettes from the vending \Nmachines in the elevator hall two floors down.
0.5;While climbing the stairs, I heard this\Nbellboy scream and came running.
0.5;How did you know she was killed \Nwhile you were working on your book?
0.5;Her jaw was beginning to stiffen \Nwhen her body was discovered.
0.5;I think it's been about two or \Nthree hours since her death.
0.5;If you knew that without \Neven touching her body,
0.5;maybe you should switch to \Nbeing a mystery author instead?
0.5;She was supposed to bring documents \Nto my room a couple hours ago,
0.5;When I saw her body, I assumed she \Ncouldn't come because she'd been killed.
0.5;So was she actually killed \Ntwo or three hours ago?
0.5;her estimated time of death is two and a \Nhalf hours before her body was discovered.
0.5;Isn't that around the time you \Nboys were eating in my room?
0.5;I'm Hiura-sensei's editor \Nat Nichiuri Publishing.
0.5;so we were eating in his\Nroom with two other editors.
0.5;I decided to finish the manuscripts of \Nthe editors who ate the most food first.
0.5;Couldn't you have snuck \Nout of the room then?
0.5;but we could clearly see the entryway from \Nthe living room where we were eating.
0.5;so I don't think Hiura-sensei even \Napproached the doorway while we were eating.
0.5;we could see the door to his room \Nwhile waiting for the elevators.
0.5;He returned to his room \Nimmediately afterwards.
0.5;Does that mean you finished three \Nmanuscripts in a short amount of time?
0.5;"I was stuck on the last scene of ""The Phone,\Nthe Ocean, and I"" which he works on."
0.5;After 5:30, I printed out everything \Nexcept the final pages to give to him,
0.5;He headed towards the stairs \Nwith his wallet in his hand.
0.5;While I was reading the manuscript, \NI heard the bellboy shouting.
0.5;Hiura-sensei called to tell me \Nsomething had happened downstairs.
0.5;When I got here, you were all \Nstanding in front of the room.
0.5;Can you think of anyone who may have \Nborn a grudge against Minazuki-san?
0.5;"It said, ""If you don't fire the \Nassistant, you'll regret it."""
0.5;We did check the sender, but \Nit was a convenience store.
0.5;It's because a weekly magazine printed \Npictures of us walking around town together,
0.5;Because of it, my wife went \Nback to her parents' house.
0.5;Nearly all his works are \Nabout pure and genuine love.
0.5;He has many female fans\Nwho despise adultery.
0.5;What was your relationship with \NMinazuki-san actually like?
0.5;She was a great assistant\Nwith plenty of ideas.
0.5;"She worked so hard on ""The \NPhone, the Ocean, and I."""
0.5;I was thinking of letting her become \Nan independent writer next year.
0.5;A middle school aged girl \Nwho looks just like Sera!
0.5;A middle school student \Nwho looks like Sera-san?
0.5;There was a picture of a girl who \Nlooks like Sera on her phone, too.
0.5;He was in his room with his \Neditors watching over him.
0.5;Using a rope to climb down from \Nthe balcony would be pretty scary.
0.5;If the editors could see the entryway from \Nwhere they were eating in the living room,
0.5;then they must have been able \Nto see the balcony, too.
0.5;I was visiting Sera-san's place, \Nand something happened...
0.5;The caps for the shampoo and \Nconditioner are missing?
0.5;There were lots of people \Nbringing delivery food, right?
0.5;How did I move the body from \Nthis room to the one below?
0.5;"The next episode is ""The Romance Novel\Nwith the Unexpected Conclusion, Part Two!"""
0.5;So Shinichi-kun acted like he solved \Nthe mystery of the cherry blossom badge
0.5;through reasoning when he \Nactually just saw what happened?
0.5;it sounds like he wanted to \Nprotect you from your bullies.
0.5;All I saw through the window \Nthen was a girl who was upset
0.5;Even heaven is watching the \Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills \Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;Hiding in the shadows was \Nan adults' conspiracy.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;I'll stop by when I take \NShin-chan to preschool.
0.5;Don't forget to wear a hat \Nand glasses when you come.
0.5;You'll cause a commotion \Nif people know it's you.
0.5;If one simply knocks out \Nall the central inferences,
0.5;and presents one's audience with the \Nstarting-point and the conclusion,
0.5;one may produce a startling, though \Npossibly a meretricious, effect.
0.5;I told you we're going to \Nyour new preschool today.
0.5;Besides, you'll have to \Nwear glasses like Yusaku
0.5;Shin-chan, put this on your \Nchest so we can get out of here.
0.5;The last thing I'd like \Nto ask about is allergies.
0.5;Is there anything we shouldn't \Nfeed Shinichi-kun?
0.5;I thought it was a morgue like the one \NI saw in that movie the other day.
0.5;She's the one who had \Nsomething taken from her.
0.5;Since her clothes are the \Nonly ones missing a badge,
0.5;Dad made stars by making \Na straight diagonal cut,
0.5;Since she had her badge \Ntaken from her earlier,
0.5;Holmes said if one simply knocks \Nout all the central inferences,
0.5;and presents one's audience with the \Nstarting-point and the conclusion,
0.5;Now if I clearly explain \Nto her why I thought that,
0.5;and were crying while \Nmaking a new one, crybaby.
0.5;Don't disappear while I'm filling \Nout admissions paperwork.
0.5;I need to make sure she \Ndoesn't find the name tag
0.5;And Shinichi-kun, you shouldn't \Ncall people crybabies.
0.5;because that teacher's giving \NRan-chan all his attention?
0.5;It is a problem if he's \Nplaying favorites, though.
0.5;Ran sleeps closest to the \Nbathroom because one time
0.5;while she was sleeping far away \Nfrom it, she didn't make it in time.
0.5;because she has a really \Npoor sense of direction
0.5;and once got separated from the \Ngroup and ended up somewhere crazy.
0.5;He said he'd tell me why \Ntomorrow when we go for a walk.
0.5;Shinichi, does Ran-chan sleep \Nlonger than the other kids?
0.5;She always sleeps soundly \Nuntil she's the last one up.
0.5;I have a fan who shares the name \NEfune with Shinichi's teacher.
0.5;If anything, I think you're \Nthe one being bullied.
0.5;It's been parked outside the rear \Nexit of the preschool for a while.
0.5;We might want to write down its license \Nplate number just in case, too.
0.5;There are no time constraints \Nto starting over.
0.5;A simple novelist who's been \Ngaining popularity recently.

0.5;Each day you held her hand \Nso your brother-in-law
0.5;You called her name loudly \Nand raised her to the top
0.5;and confirm that she was \Nthe child she wanted.
0.5;And you had her sleep \Nnext to the bathroom
0.5;so she'd be closest when your \Nbrother-in-law broke into the bathroom.
0.5;Didn't the accident you \Nmentioned as the reason
0.5;because you'd been slipping her sedatives \Nso she'd be easier to kidnap?
0.5;so you'd be able to happily live \Ntogether even after you kidnapped her.
0.5;You actually meant to spend \Nmore time winning her over,
0.5;but you had to rush your plan since \Nmy son nearly discovered you.
0.5;has locked the bathroom \Nwindow after you left,
0.5;and is standing in front of \Nthe bathroom door right now
0.5;I couldn't just watch my \Nwife waste away day by day.

0.5;which means it was likely she grew \Nup somewhere outside Hokkaido.
0.5;of the female detective in the novel \NI wrote felt like it was written for her.
0.5;It's when the detective finds a \Nrunaway who faked their suicide,
0.5;She really didn't like \Nbeing called a crybaby.
0.5;Does that mean he's been in \Nlove with you since then?
0.5;His first crush has got \Nto be his actress mom.
0.5;It's time for me to give up \Nmy black belt and retire.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Mystery \Nof the Missing Black Belt!"""
0.5;Next week's episode features a \Nblack belt. Hattori's dark-skinned.

0.5;It was supposed to be a feel-good hiking \Ntrip but misfortune strikes an arguing group.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Apparently she's sleeping at the \Nbottom of this cliff tonight.
0.5;Hey, what's the accident that \Nhappened three years ago?
0.5;When Motoki went after her, he \Nfell from the top of the cliff.
0.5;So we get together every year \Nto commemorate his death.
0.5;I'm sending it up to the stratosphere \Nto collect meteorological data.
0.5;Hayashida-san, you're a \Nweather station employee.
0.5;For the next ten days, I'm going to \Nbe sending up my balloon every day.
0.5;Each time we increase the power, \Nit's coated with kerosene.
0.5;Couldn't you use one of \Nthose to fly to the peak?
0.5;A single balloon can only carry \Nfive or six kilograms at most.
0.5;He said he was going to a nearby \Nmountain to collect data.
0.5;the late Yamakura \NTakemi-san's acquaintances?
0.5;in the forest three kilometers \Nfrom the crime scene.
0.5;We'd like you to confirm if \Nit belonged to Yamakura-san.
0.5;Inside were the knife we believe is the \Nmurder weapon and an empty wallet.
0.5;Then the killer fled down the mountain \Nafter killing Takemi-san at the bottom.
0.5;to the foot of the \Nmountain since about 4 AM,
0.5;to make it look as though \Nan outsider killed her.
0.5;In other words, the crime was \Ncommitted during those two hours.
0.5;it takes about forty to fifty minutes to \Ntake the path down to the crime scene.
0.5;three kilometers away would \Nadd another thirty to forty minutes.
0.5;Since the return trip is uphill, \Nit took more than sixty minutes.
0.5;And they were sleeping \Nin the cottage with us.
0.5;went to the crime scene and forest, \Nand returned within two hours.
0.5;if they climbed straight \Nup and down the cliff,
0.5;Even an experienced climber \Nwould take an hour one way.
0.5;If he rode down the rapids in \Nthe river next to this field...
0.5;That would get him there, \Nbut how would he return?
0.5;He flew through the air like a bird to \Nreach the crime scene and the forest.
0.5;But a single balloon can barely \Ncarry five or six kilograms.
0.5;It would still be difficult even \Nif he used all his balloons.
0.5;It was past the forest \Nwhere we found the bag.
0.5;Then you tied the balloon to her \Nbag and took it to the forest.
0.5;Unfortunately for you, \Nit got caught on a tree.
0.5;Besides, wasn't the red \Ncompass at the crime scene
0.5;It's surveying equipment \Nfor attaching to balloons.
0.5;Hayashida-san, did you wipe your \Nhands and body thoroughly yesterday?
0.5;It's used to increase the \Nstrength of rubber balloons.
0.5;If anyone used the balloons, \Nthe smell would remain on them.
0.5;Couldn't he have wiped his hands \Nimmediately after committing the crime?
0.5;could you search the shed \Nbehind me for balloons?
0.5;Hayashida-san, how many balloons \Nare supposed to be there?
0.5;The killer left the cottage before 3 AM \Nwhen everyone had fallen asleep,
0.5;That's why they had to move \Naway from the cottage.
0.5;After 3 AM, they offered a \Nsilent prayer to Motoki-san,
0.5;waited for the others to fall \Nback asleep, left the cottage,
0.5;Only six balloons aren't \Nenough for a person to fly.
0.5;like a bird spreading \Ntheir wings to decelerate.
0.5;They reduced their speed by landing \Non the rocks partway down the cliff
0.5;They reached the crime \Nscene quickly this way.
0.5;It's a photo of the rocks \Nin the middle of the cliff.
0.5;There are some strange footprints \Npointing towards the edge.
0.5;it would've had to have been \Nsomeone extremely light to...
0.5;The balloons floated north \Non the wind to the lake,
0.5;You killed Takemi-san, left Motoki-san's \Ncompass at the crime scene,
0.5;and headed north with \NTakemi-san's bag and wallet.
0.5;and beyond that you left \Nthe deflated balloon.
0.5;you put the surveying equipment with \NTakemi-san's blood in Hayashida-san's bag.
0.5;to the bottom of the cliff \Nand you could confirm
0.5;I was sleeping with Ayumi-chan \Nwhen she was killed.
0.5;I didn't kill her, and I \Ndidn't go to the forest!
0.5;It probably came from you while \Nyou were sleeping together.
0.5;After going to the forest, \Nyou came to right below here.
0.5;But using the mountain path \Nmight leave more evidence.
0.5;That's why you began climbing \Nback up this cliff.
0.5;But you were in such a hurry, you \Nmade a mistake at the very end.
0.5;This mark must have been \Nleft by the balloons' rope.
0.5;That's why you didn't tell Motoki-san he \Nwas heading towards a dangerous cliff!
0.5;There's a weird smell mixed \Nin with the smell of alcohol.

0.5;Come to think of it, I heard there \Nused to be a place like that.

0.5;I heard they don't do \Nthat at schools anymore.

0.5;since you're the only one \Nwho attended high school.
0.5;You've got a big head just \Nbecause we didn't complete

0.5;I'm stuffing myself until \NI'm full of this shit!
0.5;No, you don't. Your age doesn't \Nmake you say anything.

0.5;No, including Toyoko-san, \Nit's the four of them.
0.5;Those three women conspired to \Nput a cabbage core in the monja
0.5;We're dealing with women who \Ndon't have long left to live.
0.5;I give them a proper talking to, \Nmake them reflect on their actions,
0.5;So it was Eiko, Kyoko, and \NYuko who tried to kill me
0.5;Could you ask your friends \Nat the MPD to handle it?
0.5;you use two spatulas to finely chop \Ningredients spread over a hot plate.
0.5;In other words, even if a cabbage core \Nwere mixed in with the ingredients,
0.5;it should've been chopped too small to get \Ncaught in your throat by the time you ate it.
0.5;must have been put in after you \Nfinished preparing the monja.
0.5;Not only that, but if the core was \Ncarelessly thrown into the ingredients,
0.5;The only certain way to choke \Nyou would be to put it in
0.5;falling into the bit of \Nmonja you were about to eat?
0.5;In other words, the four \Nof you worked together

0.5;Darn it! When that long-haired\Njerk leaves the bathroom--
0.5;Don't tell me\Nthat person was involved?!
0.5;Just as this photo shows,\Nthe victim fell to the floor
0.5;Yeah. The door was unlocked\Nbut it wouldn't open
0.5;The victim was\NHimeno Yayoi, 24 years old.
0.5;There's a thin mark on her throat,\Nas if she had been choked!
0.5;the killer probably strangled\Nher unconscious, stabbed her,
0.5;and then drew the knife out\Nto induce blood loss.
0.5;The empty wallet\Nnext to the murder weapon...
0.5;And then the victim's body,\Nwhich blocked the stall door...
0.5;In other words, the killer\Nentered through the window,
0.5;killed Himeno-san,\Nwho just happened to come in,
0.5;stole her money, and quickly\Nescaped out the window.
0.5;Alright!\NThis was an outside job!
0.5;Look at that window!\NDoesn't it seem too clean?
0.5;What's wrong\Nwith a clean bathroom?
0.5;I just happened\Nto be in the coffee shop.
0.5;At any rate, judging from\Nthe amount of blood loss,
0.5;the killer should have been\Nsprayed with blood.
0.5;Yet there are no traces of\Nblood on the window used to escape.
0.5;But the killer\Ncould've wiped it off!
0.5;Would a killer who hastily\Nescaped without the murder weapon
0.5;They left it there because\Nthey couldn't take it with them!
0.5;It was someone\Nin this restaurant!
0.5;That's what you want to say,\Nright, little boy?
0.5;There are no signs\Nof the body being moved,
0.5;and the other stall\Ndoesn't have a window!
0.5;How did the\Nkiller leave the stall?!
0.5;There is only one way.\NFrom above.
0.5;In the next stall, so as\Nnot to disturb the evidence.
0.5;But if the killer\Nwas covered in blood,
0.5;there should be\Nblood on the wall too!
0.5;Luckily, there's water\Nand paper in here to wipe it off.
0.5;But what if someone accidentally\Nwalked in and saw them?!
0.5;Locking it would make\Nthis room impenetrable.
0.5;Alright! Find everyone who came\Nin here around the time the victim did!
0.5;There was that\Nbig guy over there,
0.5;You have a\Ngood memory, little boy...
0.5;Now then, can you tell\Nus why you came here today,
0.5;in order of who\Nused the restroom?
0.5;I went in next,\Nwhile the victim was still inside.
0.5;I come here almost everyday\Nto chat with the bartender.
0.5;Is that the order\Nthey went in, Conan-kun?
0.5;Something seems\Ndifferent from before...
0.5;It would seem this narrows the\Nsuspects down to Sumeragi-san and myself.
0.5;No, of course\NI don't suspect you!
0.5;We found this rope\Non Sumeragi-san's table!
0.5;That's just some string\NI use to tie my books together!
0.5;"He entered the\Nrestroom before the victim;"
0.5;She asked the bartender\Nwhere the restroom was.
0.5;This was probably a sign\Nto let the killer know
0.5;that she was going\Ninto the restroom!
0.5;Which means the only person\Nin the coffee shop then
0.5;Can we take the\Nknife down to the station?
0.5;And why is there no\Nblood on this narrow part?!
0.5;I must've gotten it when\NI looked over the stall!
0.5;Now I understand\Nthe killer's real trick!
0.5;Only that person\Ncould've done this!
0.5;That's enough of your\Ndetective game, little boy!
0.5;This is it!\NIf my logic is correct,
0.5;Oh, I found that too when\NI was taking photos of the scene.
0.5;You're starting to look\Nmore and more suspicious...
0.5;The blood was on the top of\Nthe door that the body was blocking.
0.5;If it were me,\NI would use the toilet
0.5;to climb into\Nthe next stall over.
0.5;And I wonder if the killer\Nreally was sprayed with blood...
0.5;Even the handle\Nis covered in blood!
0.5;But what's this part\Nthat has no blood on it?
0.5;Aha! The killer tied\Na string to it, stabbed her,
0.5;and then pulled it\Nout after leaving the stall!
0.5;The blood sprayed out\Nwhen the knife was removed!
0.5;But then why is there blood up there\Nif the killer wasn't sprayed with any?
0.5;Because it wasn't the killer\Nwho went over the stall,
0.5;The blood above\Nthe door got there
0.5;when the victim was being\Ndumped into the stall.
0.5;The killer stabbed her\Noutside the stall,
0.5;threw the body into it,\Nand blocked the door.
0.5;The knife was then pulled out\Nwith a tug on the string.
0.5;This way, if it were discovered\Nto be an inside job,
0.5;due to being unable\Nto fit over the stall door.
0.5;Alright!\NTake this man into custody!
0.5;Can you really arrest me\Nwithout proof?
0.5;it would only take me a few\Nhours to prove his innocence.
0.5;Oh? Don't people wear wedding\Nrings on their left ring finger?
0.5;Your bandage was on your ring\Nfinger when you entered the coffee shop.
0.5;Maybe you refastened\Nit in the bathroom?
0.5;That's it! That bandage\Nwas the string used
0.5;to strangle the victim\Nand it was tied to the knife!
0.5;Which means the victim's\Nblood should be on it!
0.5;My, my. What a\Nfoolish criminal you are
0.5;to keep this kind\Nof evidence on you.
0.5;Huh? I've seen that shoulder\Nthrow somewhere before...
0.5;Thanks to the female attorney,\Nthe killer was arrested without incident.
0.5;Apparently, he did it because\Nhe was having an affair with the victim,

0.5;Come to think of it,\Nyour job's been going well
0.5;Maybe he brought\Nsome good luck with him!
0.5;Ran. How long are we gonna\Ntake care of this twerp?
0.5;Are his parents\Nstill in the hospital?!
0.5;Actually, when I visited\NProfessor Agasa yesterday...
0.5;but then they suddenly\Ngot transferred overseas...
0.5;They said they'll send\Nfor him once they settle in.
0.5;So we're taking\Ncare of him again?
0.5;If I ever talk to his parents, I'll have\Nto charge them for his upbringing...
0.5;At 8:00 pm today,\Na man's body was found
0.5;the body was that of\N42 year old Negishi Masaki-san.
0.5;--are investigating this\Nas a possible murder--
0.5;What is it, Dad?\NDid you know him?!
0.5;I was with him\Nfor three whole days!
0.5;That's right. He's the guy\NI followed around until yesterday...
0.5;Dad sure is taking a long time\Nto give his statement.
0.5;The police don't get\Nmany witnesses like him!
0.5;Come on, old man!\NI can't wait to find out!
0.5;Yes. The late Negishi-san\Nhad a life insurance policy
0.5;Why would he give\Nall that insurance money
0.5;to an ordinary friend like you,\NAbe Yutaka-san?!
0.5;And you're the one\Nwho hired me to trail him!
0.5;Why would he give you\Nthe insurance money?!
0.5;We had been friends\Nsince college.
0.5;When we went\Ndrinking one day, he--
0.5;So you both took out\N500-million yen policies.
0.5;I had no idea the bet would\Nlast only three months...
0.5;Then why did you\Nhave Mori-kun trail him?
0.5;so I had Mori-san\Nwatch him for a few days.
0.5;I run a small business,\Nso I'm actually quite busy.
0.5;Please find Negishi-san's\Nkiller as quickly as possible.
0.5;He's the only one\NI can see as the killer,
0.5;Something's fishy!\NHe's definitely the killer!
0.5;And I was the one\Nwho verified it for him!
0.5;The body was found on Sunday night,\Nduring the Fire Festival.
0.5;In other words,\Nthe crime took place
0.5;between late Saturday\Nnight and Sunday evening,
0.5;Then the person you suspect\Nmust've done it during then...
0.5;from Saturday morning\Nuntil this afternoon!
0.5;Then why are\Nyou so fixated on him?
0.5;That damn Abe got\NNegishi-san's insurance money!
0.5;He got the half-billion\Nyen just like that!
0.5;I'm going to destroy\Nhis alibi, no matter what!
0.5;The schedule and\Npictures of his Kyushu trip.
0.5;I asked Inspector Megure\Nto let me borrow them.
0.5;Just you watch!\NI, the great Mori Kogoro-sama,
0.5;Let's just hope\Nhe doesn't burn out.
0.5;But Dad, couldn't he have come back\Non short notice on a domestic flight?
0.5;Yes, it's very possible.\NBut his alibi has no holes.
0.5;Especially during the\Ntime the murder occurred.
0.5;He played mahjong with his\Nemployees all Saturday night.
0.5;Sunday afternoon,\Nhe toured the city on bus.
0.5;The only time he was alone was when\Nhe took a two hour nap Sunday afternoon.
0.5;It would be impossible to go to\NGunma and back in that amount of time.
0.5;It seems like whenever\NI'm stuck on something,
0.5;he'll say something\Nthat gives me a hint...
0.5;Say, are you sure this\Nis the guy who was killed?
0.5;The teeth even\Nmatched his dental records.
0.5;it's far too intentional for the\Nbody to be hidden under the fire
0.5;Only one person stood to\Ngain from the body's discovery:
0.5;Abe, who would get\Nthe insurance money.
0.5;The old man's right--\Nhe's the only possible person!
0.5;No, there has to be something\Nthat will destroy his story!
0.5;That's strange.\NThe Negishi-san I saw...
0.5;These are from\NThursday and Friday.
0.5;from Saturday morning\Nuntil Monday afternoon.
0.5;But if my theory is correct,\Nthen it's actually--
0.5;Look away for a second\Nand he causes trouble!
0.5;Don't hit Conan-kun just\Nbecause you can't solve the case!
0.5;Abe Yutaka is\Nclearly responsible for this!
0.5;His business was\N300 million yen in debt.
0.5;He used the insurance\Nmoney to pay it off
0.5;and plans to escape\Noverseas with the rest of it!
0.5;He left someone in charge of the company,\Nsaying that he was going on a trip.
0.5;And his plane\Nleaves at 9:00 tonight!
0.5;My only chance now is to corner\Nhim and make him confess!
0.5;There's no time! First, I need\Nto get them to the airport!
0.5;Eh? You destroyed\NAbe's alibi, Inspector?!
0.5;Alright, now to use\Nthe old man's voice...
0.5;Just finding the Inspector\Nis going to be tough...
0.5;Oh no! They're about\Nto start boarding!
0.5;It's dangerous,\Nbut I'll have to lure him out!
0.5;Paging Abe Yutaka-sama,\Nbound for Seattle
0.5;...Negishi Masaki-sama is waiting\Nfor you in the main parking lot.
0.5;Again, Abe Yutaka-sama,\Nbound for Seattle
0.5;Never mind that! How did you\Ndestroy Abe's alibi?!
0.5;Negishi-san actually died\NFriday night, didn't he?
0.5;That's right. The day before\Nyou left on your trip.
0.5;Then you had Detective Mori follow a\Nfake Negishi-san around the following day...
0.5;...to make us think\Nhe was alive until Saturday.
0.5;his body was found\Non Sunday night.
0.5;With his precise time\Nof death indeterminable,
0.5;between Saturday night\Nand Sunday evening.
0.5;Then you returned Monday afternoon,\Nas if nothing had happened.
0.5;I heard the policemen\Ntalking about the case
0.5;and I tried applying\Nmy own kind of logic!
0.5;Your actor was left-handed,\Nunlike Negishi-san!
0.5;Give yourself up. This place\Nis crawling with police.
0.5;I, Abe Yutaka, was indeed\NNegishi Masaki's killer.
0.5;Eh? But I'll tell everyone\Nthat you confessed.
0.5;I, Abe Yutaka, was indeed\NNegishi Masaki's killer.
0.5;He was stupid enough to take out\Nsuch a huge insurance policy!
0.5;And you were stupid\Nenough to let me kill you, too.
0.5;I was gonna let you off\Neasy if you turned yourself in!
0.5;I, Abe Yutaka, was indeed\NNegishi Masaki's killer.
0.5;He's one lousy bastard\Nto use me like that!
0.5;I'm glad they found\Nthe fake Negishi-san too!
0.5;Yeah. Apparently Abe asked him\Nto wander around all day
0.5;What bothers me is what\NAbe said afterwards...
0.5;Looks like these might\Nbe random murders...
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shooting comet!
0.5;Let's heal hearts dried by\Nmodern society with Conan's logic!
0.5;Today's case has Ran-neechan\Nplaying an important part!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;Ran, the old man,\Nand I attended the Izu Mystery Tour
0.5;in place of Professor Agasa, his friend,\Nand his friend's granddaughter.
0.5;The anonymous tour organizer\Nwould play the Night Baron
0.5;Whoever determines the organizer's\Nidentity gets to stay for free
0.5;and receives floppy disks\Ncontaining a certain program.
0.5;The attendees\Nkeep each other in check...
0.5;The Night Baron pushed me\Noff a balcony when I was all alone.
0.5;Was this a warning?\NOr just part of the game?
0.5;The Night Baron plummeted\Nonto a bronze statue!
0.5;So it was the\NNight Baron who fell!
0.5;Oh? Don't you live\Nwith Detective Mori?
0.5;Yokomizo-san from the\NSaitama police department?
0.5;He was on the same\NMystery Tour as us...
0.5;Which means the organizer\Nwas Ebara-san here.
0.5;A suicide? An accident?\NOr maybe a--
0.5;What?! Ebara-san fell off\Ndressed as the Night Baron?!
0.5;Yes, according to eyewitnesses,\Nhe fell at precisely 10:00!
0.5;So, did you check Room 2101,\Nwhere he was staying?
0.5;We tried to, but we\Ncouldn't get inside.
0.5;Those are the ones\Nhe was wearing today.
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nhe was pretty drunk...
0.5;No doubt about it.\NThere's a glove in the railing.
0.5;He probably tried to climb down\Nthe veranda in that costume
0.5;But he screwed up\Nand fell to his death.
0.5;Would he really try to\Ngo down without a rope?
0.5;If he did make it to the room\Nbelow and then left through it,
0.5;he would've needed\Nthe key to get back in here.
0.5;Anyway, let me\Nhave a look at the body.
0.5;Seeing it won't\Nchange anything, though.
0.5;So he fell twenty-one\Nstories onto that statue...
0.5;No, sir. Aside from us, only one\Nother person has touched him.
0.5;Is it true that Ebara-san\Nwas the one who fell, Mori-san?
0.5;No question about it.\NIt was Ebara Tokio.
0.5;I see. So he was the tour\Norganizer and the Night Baron.
0.5;Though it is disturbing that the\Nimmortal Night Baron would perish...
0.5;Yes. He fell off the veranda\Ntrying to scare you all.
0.5;At any rate,\Nthe Night Baron has died.
0.5;He's not good\Nwith accessories, is he?
0.5;Which means Ebara-san\Nwas pushed off the 21st floor
0.5;In other words, the homicidal\NNight Baron is still among us!
0.5;It appears we must\Nask where each of you were
0.5;What should we do with\Nthe body and the costume?
0.5;Let's set him in the office until\Nwe're done with the questioning.
0.5;So you were in the observation\Nlounge with Ran and Conan?
0.5;But you were the one\Nwho looked at the time, right?
0.5;It was such a commotion that\NI'm unsure people would remember us.
0.5;But with the way he died,\NI can't say I blame them.
0.5;But you didn't speak\Nwith anyone, correct?
0.5;So I take it you have\Nnobody to vouch for you?
0.5;I can describe what the\Nmovie was about, though...
0.5;I can't believe they\Nmade me guard him alone!
0.5;I hope they finish\Ntheir questioning soon!
0.5;That detective and\Nyour father really tick me off!
0.5;Everyone on the\Ntour has a flimsy alibi.
0.5;Did you maybe order room\Nservice when you were in your room?
0.5;How did the killer leave after\Npushing Ebara-san off his veranda?
0.5;All we know is that\Nthe killer is still in the hotel...
0.5;The hotel keeps records of\Nwhen calls are made from rooms!
0.5;What're you doing?!\NHe's getting away! Ran-neechan!
0.5;He was collapsed in\Nthe room with the body!
0.5;It's fine, but the\NNight Baron costume is gone!
0.5;Probably up there.\NThey tossed it from that balcony.
0.5;Why did the killer\Nshow up at the elevators?
0.5;If they needed to go up, they\Nwould've used the stairs to go unseen.
0.5;And why did they\Nhave to wear the costume,
0.5;not to mention risk being\Ncaught trying to steal it?!
0.5;Could these latest things\Nhave been unplanned?!
0.5;You were all in your rooms,\Nand you have no witnesses!
0.5;Which means none\Nof you have alibis for when
0.5;You told us not to leave our rooms,\Nand that's just what we did!
0.5;We're not stupid enough\Nto ignore the police.
0.5;Akiko-san and Maeda-san\Nshare the same room.
0.5;You didn't check if\Nthey were there or not?
0.5;We all came right away to\Nreport about the Night Baron!
0.5;At any rate, we'll need\Nto check all your rooms.
0.5;Nothing seems out\Nof the ordinary-- What the...
0.5;Ebara-san fell\Nfrom that veranda...
0.5;Yes. The killer dressed\Nhim up as the Night Baron
0.5;and pushed him off to\Nmake it look like an accident!
0.5;But the security lock was\Nset in the room where it happened!
0.5;In other words, the killer didn't\Nleave through the door afterward.
0.5;The veranda is the only\Nother way out of the room...
0.5;But going from there\Ninto this room is impossible.
0.5;I always carry them with me\Nfor my insomnia. That a problem?
0.5;The veranda he\Nfell from is directly above...
0.5;It might be possible\Nto climb down here...
0.5;I thought I'd watch your\Ngreat detective skills in action!
0.5;Oh, okay!\NIn that case, pay close attention!
0.5;There are no signs\Nof the window being broken.
0.5;My eyes are bad.\NCan you answer, Shizue-san?
0.5;Of course it was.\NI check it each time we leave.
0.5;I've heard that he was suspected\Nof using his bank's computers
0.5;He may have wanted to\Nsee the Baron the most of all.
0.5;Who's he to talk? He's the one\Nwho hates the Night Baron the most.
0.5;After all, the son he so dutifully\Nraised was murdered by the virus.
0.5;The Night Baron. Hearing\Nthat name brings back memories
0.5;This is the closest window to the veranda,\Nbut there's no way across.
0.5;Though I hear they\Ndivorced three years ago.
0.5;That's right. The late\NEbara Tokio was my husband.
0.5;But that was three years ago...\Nwhen I learned he was a hacker.
0.5;I believe Sayama Akiko-san's\Nbrother ran a small software company.
0.5;Meaning that everyone on\Nthe tour had a reason to kill him.
0.5;Oh? These are the same\Npills that Akiko-san had...
0.5;Oh, I thought they were\Nsleeping pills. Guess not.
0.5;What are you blabbing about now?!\NGo get in bed, kid!
0.5;Ah, well. It's the same layout\Nas Konno-san's room downstairs.
0.5;Well, looking at\Neveryone's rooms, we get...
0.5;So the only possible escape\Nfrom Ebara-s an's veranda
0.5;was through Kaneshiro-san\Nand Hayashi-san's room...
0.5;I'm not sure. It's a piece\Nof the security lock.
0.5;Oh, yeah. Ebara-san's room\Nis on this floor, too.
0.5;He dodged all of my\Nkicks with no effort at all!
0.5;The only suspect who\Ncould've done that was... him!
0.5;That's strange.\NI don't remember locking it.
0.5;Using that trick,\Nanyone could have killed him!
0.5;I'll have to check\Neach of their alibis...
0.5;That would seal the room\Nand make it look like an accident!
0.5;Next episode the case is finally solved.\N You're the culprit!
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na glittering shooting star!
0.5;Conan's logic is good medicine\Nfor hearts dried by modern society!
0.5;Today's case is a sad memory\Nhidden behind bandages!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;During the birthday party\Nof the Nagato Group president,
0.5;was attacked by someone\Nin the room below!
0.5;The eldest son, Hideomi-san,\Nappeared on the veranda
0.5;We rushed to the room\Nbelow but were too late...
0.5;Mitsuaki-san had been\Nimpaled on the fence below!
0.5;Two days later, Hideomi-san's\Nbody was found in the pond,
0.5;It seemed certain\Nthat he had done it...
0.5;There's something\Nunnatural about that will!
0.5;In other words, Hideomi-san had\Nbeen murdered before it happened!
0.5;Your father told us\Nto be especially alert, too...
0.5;Your father told us\Nto be especially alert, too...
0.5;After all, we only left the front\Ndoor for one or two minutes
0.5;when we discovered\Nthe body with you.
0.5;Hideomi-san must've used\Nthat chance to enter the pond
0.5;The late Mitsuaki-san was\Nthe only one who went outside.
0.5;He said he was\Nlooking for Hideomi-san...
0.5;He was searching all over.\NBetween trees, around the pond...
0.5;Anything strange\N about Hideomi-san lately?
0.5;He ate much more than usual the\Nday of the murder and the day before!
0.5;It was surprising because\Nhe rarely even ate breakfast!
0.5;Say, did Hideomi-san\Nalways wear the same bandages?
0.5;I think they were last changed\Ntwo days before the incident...
0.5;One of his sheets\Ndisappeared three days ago!
0.5;The bottom of Mitsuaki-san's\Nand Yasue-san's veranda.
0.5;What's that mark?\NIt's like something hit it...
0.5;And that's the veranda\NMitsuaki-san was pushed off of...
0.5;Remember those drunken messages\Nyou left me two days ago?
0.5;You left a bunch of half-hour\Nmessages before 10:00 at night...
0.5;You don't remember,\Nso never mind. Bye!
0.5;10:00 pm two nights ago\Nwas when the murder happened!
0.5;All these books!\NHe was a writer, all right!
0.5;Just look who's\Ntrashing the place up...
0.5;I'll be at the usual\Nplace at 1:00 tomorrow
0.5;October 31st?\NThat's the day before the incident...
0.5;This is Yamada.\NI'm at the usual coffee shop.
0.5;This is Yamada.\NI waited for six hours.
0.5;I guess you can't come,\Nso I'll be going.
0.5;Hey! Don't tell me\NHideomi-san was actually--
0.5;Yeah, right! His estimated\Ntime of death was...
0.5;Yeah! And only that\Nperson could've done it!
0.5;If our theory is correct,\Nit's probably in here...
0.5;A muddy sheet!\NOh, and a swimming cap!
0.5;We're leaving now, Conan-kun.\NIt's already dark out...
0.5;Then, please have everyone\Ncome there in one hour!
0.5;We had them buy everything\Nwe need for our theory...
0.5;We were so focused on our\Ntheory that we completely forgot...
0.5;OK! We'll begin in\Nten minutes, as scheduled!
0.5;We're here, Hattori-kun. \NWhat's this about?
0.5;I finally figured out\Nwho killed Mitsuaki-san
0.5;and threw Hideomi-san\Ninto the pond!
0.5;Hey, now. It was Hideomi-san\Nwho killed Mitsuaki-san!
0.5;Then he poisoned\Nhimself in the pond!
0.5;Even the handwriting\Non the will matched up with--
0.5;Now, then, Inspector.\NPlease pick it up.
0.5;Do so and the tragic night\NMitsuaki-san died on the fence
0.5;I don't know!\NBut we have to save him!
0.5;This was how the killer\Ndrove everyone from the room...
0.5;to hide the terrifying truth\Nthat happened in here afterward.
0.5;were all an act by Mitsuaki-san\Nto frame Hideomi-san!
0.5;That's absurd! The killer was\Ncovered in Mitsuaki-san's blood!
0.5;And there were cuts\Non Mitsuaki-san's body!
0.5;The blood was applied to\Nthe bandaged face with a syringe.
0.5;So he wore a swimming\Ncap to keep his own hairs out.
0.5;We found the syringe and\Ncap in Mitsuaki-san's room!
0.5;But, Mitsuaki-san was the one murdered!\NWhy would he do all that?
0.5;The plan was probably for\NMitsuaki-san to kill the president
0.5;and return below while his\Naccomplice kept everyone downstairs.
0.5;But, he was killed\Nby his accomplice instead.
0.5;Killed by the\Nperson who stayed behind...
0.5;But, then he should've\Nfallen with the knife on him!
0.5;He likely tossed his knife, bandages,\Nand hat outside before his climb.
0.5;Mitsuaki-san planned to strangle\Nthe president with the grappling hook
0.5;Naturally, Miyuki-san's\Nonly target was Mitsuaki-san.
0.5;Nobody would suspect\Na dead man had used a trick!
0.5;She pulled his rope in,\Ngrabbed the weight on the opposite end,
0.5;the weight hit the bottom of the\Nveranda and it stopped on its own!
0.5;As proof, there are marks\Non the bottom of the verandas
0.5;in the president's room\Nand Mitsuaki-san's room.
0.5;And, on Nobuko-san's\Nveranda below us.
0.5;Miyuki-san probably tested it the\Nday before to see if it was possible.
0.5;Yes. And the sound of someone\Nrunning through the hall.
0.5;to run from Mitsuaki-san's\Nroom to the spare key and back.
0.5;In other words, she had planned\Nthis murder the day before!
0.5;Are you saying she killed Hideomi-san, too?\NAnd what about the will?!
0.5;I already told you, Inspector.\NHer only target was Mitsuaki-san.
0.5;Miyuki-san most likely\Nfound him dead in his room
0.5;But, Mori-kun. The coroner\Ncalculated his time of death--
0.5;If you put a body in the\Nground and deprive it of air,
0.5;She probably had Mitsuaki-san\Nhelp her wrap him in a sheet,
0.5;There were already lots of\Nholes for trees to be planted in,
0.5;He dug him up and threw him\Nin there just before the murder...
0.5;While pretending\Nto look for him, of course...
0.5;But, we saw Hideomi-sama\Nthe day of the murder...
0.5;Nope. What you saw was a\Ndisguised Miyuki-san or Mitsuaki-san.
0.5;It was clear once we\Nchecked his answering machine
0.5;that he was dead\Nthe day before the murder!
0.5;"""I have a good way for\Nyou to take the title of president"
0.5;"and place all the\Nblame on Hideomi-san."""
0.5;That can't be! He saved her life!\NShe couldn't possibly frame him!
0.5;What's that have\Nto do with anything, Dad?
0.5;No, you didn't forget to\Nput it on. You can't put it on.
0.5;When you pushed\NMitsuaki-san off the veranda,
0.5;If he tore it off, your watch\Nwould land with his body.
0.5;Flustered, you used something\Non you to stab his right hand!
0.5;Yes. She removed the cap\Nwith her mouth and stabbed him
0.5;I took the cap off to write some\Nnotes and saw the tip was bent!
0.5;Not even a fire could\Nbend something like that!
0.5;If our theory is correct, the ones\Nwho started that fire twenty years ago...
0.5;Assuming Hideomi-san didn't fix\Nhis burn scars to atone for his sin...
0.5;And if there was more to his will\Nin which he confessed everything...
0.5;Now I see. It was revenge for\Nher parents who died in the fire...
0.5;Why did you make Nobuko-san\Nangry so we'd find Hideomi-san?
0.5;The police would've\Nfound him soon enough...
0.5;I didn't want to leave him\Nin that cold water any more...
0.5;Stay away!\NThere's gasoline inside here!
0.5;The detective's right! His will\Nexplained everything about the fire!
0.5;They had to pay...\NThe carefree Mitsuaki...
0.5;and Hideomi-san,\Nwho never said a word about it...
0.5;...couldn't help but\Nfall in love with him!
0.5;He always came to cheer\Nme up after I lost my family!
0.5;I'm all alone again...\NI have to hurry to him...
0.5;Y'know, Kudo. Maybe we\Nshoulda let her die after all...
0.5;A detective who\Ncorners someone with logic,
0.5;but lets them commit suicide,\Nis no different from a murderer.
0.5;"Pains me to hear that. Only the\N""perfect"" you could say such a line!"
0.5;There's no such\Nthing as a perfect person.
0.5;"Besides, I'm sure\N""he'll"" save Miyuki-san."
0.5;No more foolish talk\Nabout following Hideomi...
0.5;What would you know?!\NYou never knew her!
0.5;After all, that pen of yours\Nis a present I gave your mother
0.5;It seems you thought\Nit was your father's, though.
0.5;I won't ask you to\Nforgive what Hideomi did,
0.5;but you're still young!\NYour life's just begun!
0.5;I'm certain your\Nmother wishes that as well!
0.5;His first love was\NMiyuki-san's mother?!
0.5;Yeah, probably. So he made\Nup that lie to cover for her.
0.5;"I thought he lied and said,\N""Miyuki-san was with me the whole time,"""

0.5;Alright, Kudo. Don't tell me\Nyou knew that the whole time!
0.5;This runt wanted\Ndetails about the incident, more

0.5;The high school girl band I saw in \Na movie last night was super cute!
0.5;Sonoko-neechan, what instrument \Nare you going to play?
0.5;My brother's friend taught \Nme a long time ago.
0.5;Yeah, but there doesn't seem to be anyone \Nin our class who can play the guitar.
0.5;had a girl named Azusa \Nwho was good at guitar!
0.5;No one will be able to tell \Nif you put on a uniform.
0.5;That movie sure had a \Nnegative influence on her.
0.5;With a little practice, you'll \Nbe able to play in no time.
0.5;I thought that with a little practice, \Nyou could play in no time.
0.5;So why don't you show us \Nthat right here, miss?
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;But expectations are high for the \Nhigh school girl trio's band.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Um, in the movie I think they \Ndid this with their fingers...
0.5;You've got some nerve to say those things\Nwhen you can't even play, little girl.
0.5;With some practice, even these \Ngirls can learn to play that.
0.5;We could have a high school girl \Nplus handsome man band, right?
0.5;Well, he is a Public Safety officer \Ninfiltrating the Black Organization.
0.5;Would you like to go to a rental studio \Nand practice a little right now?
0.5;you can at least learn the feel of \Na song through chords and tones.
0.5;although I can't guarantee I'm \Nbetter than your brother's friend.
0.5;Do you remember what the man who \Ntaught you bass looked like?
0.5;But how did you know my \Nbrother's friend was a man?
0.5;And, Hagie, your drums felt \Nmore sluggish than usual.
0.5;And you haven't noticed that \Nyour button's nearly fallen off.
0.5;In any case, we'll resume \Nonce we've cooled our heads.
0.5;Until then, I'm going to \Ntake a nap in the studio.
0.5;This is a tribute concert for Akane, \Nso we have to make it a success.
0.5;I'll go wake Hagie while \Nsewing your button on.
0.5;There was a part of the \Nsong I wanted to change.
0.5;But if Hagie's sleeping in \Nthe studio, I guess I can't.
0.5;I can't write music unless \NI can play my keyboard.
0.5;"Now that we've decided you'll be playing \NOkino Yoko-san's ""Dandelion,"""
0.5;Aren't those screams from the \Ngirl band we saw just now?
0.5;We can view the footage from the \Nsecurity camera on the ceiling.
0.5;...even if someone did something \Nnext to the victim...
0.5;you attached to a mic stand \Nto record your performance,
0.5;and preventing us from \Nknowing who killed her.
0.5;Although in the end I think we decided \Nwhere to put it when Hagie said,
0.5;Did you not get in trouble \Nwith the studio staff
0.5;That it would be enough to watch \Nthe video we recorded later.
0.5;Which means this situation \Nwas just waiting to happen.
0.5;The culprit must've been \Nexpecting this situation
0.5;In any case, we should probably \Nquestion the three girls,
0.5;While the four of you were \Ntaking a break in the basement,
0.5;Hagie-san said she was going to take \Na nap and returned to the studio.
0.5;Since she'd been sleeping \Nfor more than thirty minutes,
0.5;But when you got there, \Nshe had been murdered.
0.5;She was still asleep by the time \NI finished reattaching the button,
0.5;When I agreed to sew the button on \NSomeka's jacket that was coming off,
0.5;I realized I forgot my \Nsewing kit in the studio.
0.5;but you can tell she's sewing \Nsomething onto the jacket.
0.5;Does it really take that \Nlong to sew a button?
0.5;When I looked more closely, I \Nrealized her cuffs were frayed, too.
0.5;My guitar's out for maintenance, \Nso I borrowed one from the studio.
0.5;I thought I'd try waking her \Nwhile I replaced the string.
0.5;The broken string is the reason \Nthe four of us stopped practice,
0.5;I wanted to replace the \Nstring and tune it myself.
0.5;This is you replacing the string \Nand tuning the guitar.
0.5;And you're standing pretty \Nclose to the drums.
0.5;I was making noise on \Npurpose so she'd wake up.
0.5;She was sleeping with her \Nface on the high tom-tom
0.5;Are you trying to say I killed \Nher when I went first?
0.5;Rumi-san, were you the \Nlast one to go wake her?
0.5;During practice, there was actually a \Nsection of the song I wanted to change.
0.5;I thought I could wake her \Nwhile working on the song.
0.5;There does seem to be a \Nsection that was rewritten.
0.5;we might not get to perform \Nthat song anymore.
0.5;I moved away from the drums \Nso I wouldn't wake Hagie.
0.5;I wanted Hagie to hear the song \Nonce I finished fixing it,
0.5;It looks like you were in the \Nstudio for about ten minutes, too.
0.5;Well, we're going to look for the \Nstring used to strangle Hagie-san.
0.5;The estimated time of death \Nis when the three of them
0.5;According to the store's security \Ncameras at the entrance,
0.5;When I see people carrying \Nguitar cases on their backs,
0.5;when I saw Shu-nii standing \Non the opposite side
0.5;of the train platform with \Na guitar on his back.
0.5;Does that mean she's \Nactually Akai-san's sister?
0.5;And I'd never seen him play \Nany instruments before.
0.5;I was on my way back from \Nthe movies with my friends,
0.5;He found me on the station platform \Nafter changing trains a few times.
0.5;but when I told him I didn't have any \Nmoney and didn't know how to get home,
0.5;he told me to wait there \Nwhile he bought me a ticket
0.5;I actually did have money, \Nand I knew how to get home.
0.5;But I thought Shu-nii must \Nstill see me as a little kid.
0.5;So the person who taught you to \Nplay the bass you mentioned...
0.5;Yeah, although it was only \Nfor about ten minutes.
0.5;why don't we solve the \Ncase that's happening right now?
0.5;Like they said, it looks like we'll have \Nto investigate the other bands' members.
0.5;I want to see the practice video \Nyou said you filmed in the studio.
0.5;so we don't have video \Nof the culprit, though.

0.5;Asuka-san was an OB of my \Nhigh school soccer team,

0.5;Sometimes he'll secretly return and nap\Nin the back room of the restaurant.
0.5;Yeah, this room the staff \Nuses as a waiting room.
0.5;So the owner wasn't in the\Nstoreroom when you searched it?
0.5;But we looked for him again \Nabout ten minutes later.
0.5;I received an e-mail from \Nthe owner at that time.
0.5;"It said, ""Could you bring\NHigo and Yoko-chan"

0.5;I thought he may have returned to\Nthe back room since we took so long,
0.5;While the three of us were discussing\Nwhere the owner could've gone...
0.5;You made Yoko-chan come to \Nthis restaurant, didn't you?!
0.5;So you discovered the body \Nwhile waiting in the storeroom?
0.5;so while we were looking \Naround the storeroom...

0.5;Forensics is searching \Nthe storeroom right now.
0.5;Apparently you're the one who \Nwas smoking in the restaurant.
0.5;Th-The other two were much more\Nlikely to have motives than me.
0.5;The sommelier Yamada-san was arguing\Nwith the owner over wine last night,

0.5;Konoe-kun's only saying\Nthat because he's my ex.
0.5;But if he was wearing a blanket over\Nhis head while sleeping on the sofa,
0.5;Then couldn't you have put \Nsomething under the blanket
0.5;So you could make it appear as\Nthough the owner were still alive,
0.5;when you really killed him the first\Ntime you searched the storeroom.
0.5;the sommelier Yamada-san \Nsearched the storeroom.
0.5;Wouldn't that plan fail if\NYamada-san found the owner's body?
0.5;He was probably cleaning away fine\Ndust that nobody else would notice.
0.5;So he may already have been murdered\Nin the back of the storeroom?
0.5;so the owner said he wanted \Nto stock cheap wines instead.
0.5;I simply expressed my\Nconcern over doing that
0.5;at a place that's trying to be \Nan authentic Italian restaurant.
0.5;I-I wouldn't be able to buy them\Neither way with the owner dead!
0.5;We found quite a few cigarette\Nbutts in the bathroom's trash can.
0.5;He previously got in trouble with\Nthe owner for smoking in this room,
0.5;so I believe he was secretly \Nsmoking in the bathroom.
0.5;he could pass it off as our \Ncustomers smoking instead.
0.5;So that's why the bathroom \Nstank of cigarettes.
0.5;Maybe he didn't want us to know the \Nbathroom smelled like cigarettes.

0.5;Don't you think it's weird for a \Nrobber to ask you to come here?
0.5;You'd probably have to ask \NKomakichi for the answer.
0.5;Asuka-san sent you the letter \Nunder the name Kurataya Komakichi.
0.5;But Inspector Takajo knew about him \Ngiving you his family treasure.
0.5;Inspector Takajo couldn't \Nhave known about that.
0.5;Which means he must have heard it \Nfrom Asuka-san when she reported you.
0.5;A metalworking researcher \Nnamed Fukuhara Yuichi-san.
0.5;He asked him to recreate a \Nweapon of the Choshu Domain,
0.5;to commemorate the Hagi Reverberating \NFurnace becoming a world heritage site.
0.5;Naturally, as a work of art to appreciate \Nwithout any firing capabilities.
0.5;However, just before being completed, \Nit was stolen from the factory.
0.5;Ultimately they decided what he did was no \Ndifferent from illegally manufacturing a gun.
0.5;The culprit must have seen that and \Nasked Fukuhara-san to create the gun.
0.5;Isn't that why you quietly \Ninvited the old man to Yamaguchi,

0.5;Then Yuri-san really was the \Nculprit's intended victim.
0.5;It could only have been \Npoisoned by Morooka-san,
0.5;who passed by Yuri-san as she held her \Nglass before she left the table.
0.5;Or Fukamachi-san, who was sitting \Nnext to her when she placed her glass
0.5;on the table when she was \Nstartled by the phone alarm.
0.5;and created a reason for \Nher to leave the table.
0.5;only those three could've \Npoisoned Yuri-san's glass.
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!
0.5;a strange memory emerges in \Nthe back of Amuro's mind!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;and broke his glasses that had \Nfallen beneath the table.
0.5;The sauce for the rolled omelets \Nwas next to Fukamachi-kun.
0.5;But when I tried to get \Nit, they snapped. Right?
0.5;I remember wiping the lenses and \Nsetting them on top of the table.
0.5;I'm not sure where to look in \Nthis type of establishment.
0.5;I probably bumped them with my \Nelbow and knocked them off.
0.5;I said it was dangerous for him to get his \Nspare glasses when his eyesight is so bad.
0.5;Come to think of it, Yuri-chan put \Nsauce on her rolled omelets, too.
0.5;She said she picked up the \Nhabit from someone else. See?
0.5;In any case, I don't have a \Nsingle reason to poison her.
0.5;So you say, but maybe she was \Npressuring you to marry her.
0.5;because she picked up the \Nhabit from you, her lover.
0.5;You fabricated the threatening \Nletter yourself, too.
0.5;Was your plan to make us believe \Nshe was poisoned in your place
0.5;and murder her before your wife \Nfound out you had a mistress?
0.5;And besides, my wife passed away \Nsix months ago. She was sick.
0.5;I see. You accidentally \Ntriggered the phone's alarm.
0.5;Everyone in the restaurant, \Nincluding the victim,
0.5;so they set their glasses \Ndown to check their phones?
0.5;I was trying to check my messages while \Nmy master was getting my glasses.
0.5;It suddenly starting ringing \Nwhile I was checking my messages.
0.5;Which means you weren't \Nwearing your glasses then?
0.5;I couldn't tell who set \Ntheir glass on the table.
0.5;So you say, but maybe you had \Nsurgery to improve your eyesight.
0.5;If that's what you think, \Ntry putting on my glasses.
0.5;In fact, I'm surprised you can \Nsee anything wearing these.
0.5;I've never worn contact lenses \Nor anything like that either.
0.5;Even if I were, those lenses would be \Non my person or somewhere around me.
0.5;In the first place, like my \Nmaster, I don't have a motive.
0.5;The master patronizes the \Nclothing store next to this one.
0.5;We only come here to pass the time while \Nthe suits he purchased are being tailored.
0.5;I couldn't have poisoned Yuri's \Nglass in that fraction of a second.
0.5;I couldn't have poisoned her \Nglass when I passed by her.
0.5;Well, we weren't there when it happened. \NWe can't speak on the matter.
0.5;Besides, how would I benefit \Nfrom poisoning Yuri?
0.5;You didn't want to lose the \Nnumber one spot to her.
0.5;Every six months, the highest \Nearning bunny girl is chosen,
0.5;For the past two years, \Nyou've been number one,
0.5;but lately you'd been worried \Nsince Yuri-chan was catching up.
0.5;assuming you'd get the bonus and \Nfelt like you had to poison her.
0.5;"In that case, tell me what expensive \N""something"" I already purchased!"
0.5;That boy just asked where the \Nparking lot was and went outside.
0.5;Yes, the boss did come to get his \Nbutler Fukamachi-san's glasses.
0.5;Like them watching the restaurant \Nor checking their watches.
0.5;Speaking of unusual, the boss's \Nweight has been strange, right?
0.5;Yeah. He'll suddenly lose a bunch \Nof weight, and then gain it back.
0.5;And he's been getting injured \Na lot recently, too.
0.5;The next time you come in with an \Ninjury, I won't be able to treat you.
0.5;the victim Asakura Yuri-san's glass \Ncould've only been poisoned by
0.5;Morooka Gunzo-san, who broke his butler's \Nglasses when he stepped on them,
0.5;left his seat to get his spare glasses \Nfrom the car, and passed by Yuri-san
0.5;Fukamachi Atsufumi-san, who triggered \Nhis phone alarm accidentally
0.5;and was sitting next to Yuri-san's \Nglass when she set it on the table
0.5;to check for an earthquake \Nreport on her own phone.
0.5;Or Murakami Sana-san,\Nwho later spilled red wine
0.5;on Yuri-san's cuffs and encouraged \Nher to leave her glass
0.5;But it took only a moment for \NMorooka-san to pass by her
0.5;and Murakami-san to spill \Nred wine on her cuffs.
0.5;And Fukamachi-san wasn't wearing his \Nglasses when he triggered the alarm.
0.5;We'll just have to wait for \NYuri-san to regain consciousness.
0.5;What? The butler Fukamachi-san \Ncame to this store alone?
0.5;Yes. At first we thought he \Ncame to make a reservation.
0.5;He said he needed to talk to Yuri-chan, \Nand they headed out back together.
0.5;At first Yuri-chan was smiling \Nwhile talking to him.
0.5;"And she said, ""I won't take your \Nmoney!"" and rejected his offer."
0.5;Does that mean she was Morooka-san's \Nlover and was pushing for marriage?
0.5;But why would he come here \Nto drink if she was here?
0.5;and he came to ask her to be his lonely \Nmaster's lover in exchange for money?
0.5;So he retaliated by poisoning \Nher because she refused?
0.5;So, when did Morooka-san \Nstart coming to the store?
0.5;That's exactly around the \Ntime his wife passed away.
0.5;But he doesn't seem like \Nthe type to have a lover.
0.5;He probably messed around \Na lot when he was younger.
0.5;Come to think of it, he often said \Nhe was a troublemaker in his 20's.
0.5;They ran away together and lived \Nin Tottori for about four years.
0.5;But his parents dragged him back home, and \Nhe married the woman he was engaged to.
0.5;The butler Fukamachi-san \Ncame along with that wife.
0.5;but the wife insisted that he come \Nwith her to the Morooka family.
0.5;So, what happened to the \Ngirl he eloped with?
0.5;Who knows? She probably received a \Nton of money to break up with him.
0.5;Morooka-san's family has been \Nwealthy for generations.
0.5;Come to think of it, I think Sana-san's \Nfamily is from Tottori, too.
0.5;My father's calling.\NIs it all right if I answer?
0.5;I'll do somethin' 'bout the \Nmoney for the surgery.
0.5;We've got the same hard-as-nails \Nblood flowin' in us.
0.5;Amuro-san, what's wrong? \NYou've been acting strange.
0.5;Everyone was making a huge fuss over \Nthe weird sound he made with his phone,
0.5;That's when I bumped into Yuri \Nand spilled wine on her.
0.5;I was out getting Fukamachi-kun's \Nglasses, so...
0.5;I remember Yuri-san went to replace her \Nleft cuff that had wine spilled on it
0.5;I can't recall if you were standing \Nnext to her when the alarm sounded.
0.5;But if it's a question of whether \Nor not you were there...
0.5;You're saying Morooka-san was \Nworried about something?
0.5;Yes. That's what his bodyguards \Nout in the parking lot told me.
0.5;He'd suddenly lose and gain weight, and was \Nfrequently tripping and injuring himself.
0.5;Of course he was worried.\NHe received a threatening letter.
0.5;But, Mori-kun, the threatening \Nletter arrived...
0.5;They won't stop making fun \Nof the color of my hair.
0.5;when you peel back our skin, we're \Nall just lumps of blood and flesh.
0.5;To prove it, every race in the world \Nhas red blood flowing through them,
0.5;You're normally shy and speak \Nthe bare minimum with patients,
0.5;Are we transferring to that facility \Nthat'll back your research?
0.5;and your sister said it \Nseemed a little suspect.
0.5;Yeah, but I've heard unfavorable \Nrumors about them.
0.5;I don't want to be called \Na mad scientist again.
0.5;But your research can't be \Ndone part-time as a GP.
0.5;If the pay's good, then it's \Ntoo bad for our patients,
0.5;but I don't mind closing \Nthis clinic to help you.
0.5;It's fine. The three of us \Nare doing just fine as is.
0.5;It's your dream. You shouldn't \Ngive up on it so easily.
0.5;But if it's an honorable injury suffered while \Nmaking up with the friend you fought with,
0.5;That's why the culprit was able \Nto poison Yuri-san's glass.
0.5;I heard you're struggling to pay for \Nyour seriously ill father's surgery!
0.5;What? At least I'm not an old man who was \Ntrying to pay her to stop contacting him!

0.5;I'm hoping you can educate me\Nin the finer points of detective work.
0.5;Hey. Why do we\Nhafta sneak in from the back?

0.5;I thought I'd talk to\Nhim about you-know-what.
0.5;Oh, come to think of it,\NI haven't given you my card yet!
0.5;Oh? You certainly seem\Nto own many apartments!
0.5;Yes. I used to use them as\Noffices and rent them to people,

0.5;Oh, but it was your flirtatious\Ntendencies that started it.

0.5;I thought you, me, and Okita-kun\Nwere going to talk this evening?

0.5;Oh, yes! I bought something\NI was hoping you'd teach me about!
0.5;Oh? That's strange.\NI'm certain I left it here...
0.5;A model gun.\NIt was quite pricey, too.
0.5;The detective I'm\Ngoing to play is a flashy one
0.5;I was hoping you could\Nshow me how to hold a gun!
0.5;Besides, TV detectives\Nthese days don't carry guns!
0.5;I hear the first scene starts with\Na shootout between me and the killer
0.5;This must be quite\Na nice view at night, too!
0.5;Yeah. That's more reason\Nwhy the reporters stir up trouble here.
0.5;Hey! What happened?!\NIsami! Say something!
0.5;Thanks! I'll keep watch here\Nto make sure he doesn't escape!
0.5;Then I'll call for the\Npolice and an ambulance!
0.5;It'd be faster to go directly\Nto the nearby police box instead!
0.5;Eh?! Hijikata-san's wife,\Nin Okita-san's room?!
0.5;You have a spare key,\Ndon't you?! Come with us!
0.5;No other choice!\NLet's use the stairs! Come on!
0.5;but there hasn't\Nbeen so much as a peep.
0.5;It appears she was strangled\Nto death with a wire of some sort.
0.5;It seems she died\Nless than thirty minutes ago...
0.5;We saw her collapse on\Nthe veranda from your room!
0.5;The old guy's right.\NIt definitely looks like he killed her.
0.5;We just need to find the fishing line,\Nexpose his motive, and...
0.5;I know it must be hard, but leave\Nher as-is until the examiners arrive.
0.5;The deceased is\NHijikata Isami-san, age 38.
0.5;We can probably assume\Nshe was strangled to death
0.5;So, is it true you saw her\Nwhen she was murdered?
0.5;I can't say if it was right\Nafter she was murdered or not,
0.5;but Ran, Conan, her husband\NKozaburo-san, and I all saw her.
0.5;We heard a phone ring\Nfrom Okita-san's apartment,
0.5;and when we glanced\Nin that direction...
0.5;...Isami-san collapsed onto\Nthis veranda from inside the room.
0.5;We rushed here\Nimmediately, of course.
0.5;and there was no sound from inside,\Nno matter how hard we knocked.
0.5;We left Hijikata-san in\Nfront of the door to keep watch,
0.5;and I went to the front desk\Ndownstairs to get a spare key.
0.5;And, just as expected,\Nwhen we went inside,
0.5;I'm the one who's shocked to\Nsee Isami-san lying on my veranda!
0.5;Nor do I remember\Nanyone knocking on the door!
0.5;Besides, why would\NI kill Isami-san anyway?!
0.5;I watched the door hard\Nenough to bore a hole in it!
0.5;could you tell us what you\Nwere doing between 4:00 and 4:30,
0.5;Because Hijikata-san told\Nme to let him visit this evening.
0.5;so I could see if the rumors\Nabout him and Isami were true.
0.5;Isami-san came\Nhere before Hijikata-san
0.5;so she and Okita-san could\Nget their story straight,
0.5;but it turned into an argument,\Nand he killed her without thinking.
0.5;Hijikata-san always plays\Nfamous warriors and swordsmen.
0.5;But you're stuck playing villains\Nlike thieves, spies, and love rivals.
0.5;I'd say the same thing about\Nhow you always happen upon murders.
0.5;we have witnesses who saw the\Nbody fall onto the veranda from here,
0.5;You can save your explanations\Nfor when we're back at the station.
0.5;Come on, Conan-kun!\NDon't stay over there! Hurry inside!
0.5;Say, Ran-neechan. I guess\Nthere really are zombies, huh?
0.5;After all, when this lady fell,\Nher legs were still in the room!
0.5;But when we came here,\Nher whole body was on the veranda!
0.5;When we saw her collapse,\Nonly her upper body was on the veranda.
0.5;He probably set the body\Nagainst the veranda window.
0.5;Flustered by our\Npounding on the front door,
0.5;he pulled the body onto\Nthe veranda to avoid trouble.
0.5;If so, then the body was pulled\Nonto the veranda rather violently.
0.5;I just told you, Isami-san\Ndidn't come here! She never had before!
0.5;I tidied up because they\Nsaid they were coming over today.
0.5;Yes. This is my first\Ntime in this apartment,
0.5;After all, you ran directly to\Nthe veranda where your wife was!
0.5;Even though you've never been\Nhere! It's almost like you're psychic!
0.5;He ran right past me\Nand went straight to the veranda!
0.5;All the rooms on the 5th floor\Nand above have the same design,
0.5;Yes, I own all the rooms\Non the 6th floor, you see.
0.5;Alright. For now, let's take\NOkita-san in as a material witness.
0.5;It's true that this looks\Nlike an open-and-shut case,
0.5;He could've set things up\Nso she'd fall over on her own,
0.5;but Okita-san says he was\Nin this apartment the entire time.
0.5;I doubt he could sneak into\Nthe apartment with a dead body...
0.5;It's the newspaper reporters!\NThey caught wind of the incident!
0.5;We've locked the entrance,\Nbut given how they are...
0.5;Hey, now! We can't have them\Nget inside right now! Do something--
0.5;Say. Do you have any\Nother phones in your home?
0.5;What?! They're here, too?!\NWhere'd they come from?!
0.5;Yeah! Alright!\NI'll be right down! Just wait!

0.5;I'll divert everyone's\Nattention before a panic happens,
0.5;so you can take\NOkita down to the station!
0.5;I'd hold off on\Ntaking him if I were you.
0.5;After all, when we brought\Nthe spare key to the room,
0.5;Even if he did hide her on the veranda,\Nshe'd be seen right away!
0.5;If I was the killer, I'd hide\Nher somewhere less obvious
0.5;or escape the moment\Nthe door was open!

0.5;Since it's a special case, we'd \Nappreciate it if you joined us.
0.5;It takes a talented adviser \Nto take down an adviser.
0.5;Since it's an undercover case, I thought \Nwe'd seem less like cops with me around.
0.5;What kind of criminal \Nbrings a child with him?
0.5;When Conan-kun's around, the investigation \Nalways seems to go mysteriously well.
0.5;Yes, ma'am. Mori-san, \Nwe appreciate your help.
0.5;My name is Sato. I made an \Nappointment the other day.
0.5;In this office are all \Ndocuments related to crime,
0.5;In other words, as long as \Nyou follow my instructions,
0.5;I've always wanted to speak \Nwith a detective or the police.
0.5;You can start by taking a look \Nat these instruction manuals.
0.5;Plots are like the plan for \Na novel or play, right?
0.5;Yeah. They're like a summary \Nor framework of a story.
0.5;I've ranked them according \Nto the nature of the crime.
0.5;"There's even one called \N""thumbtack in slipper."""
0.5;I offer an exhaustive list of crimes from \Nmurder to light offenses in complete versions,
0.5;simple versions, abridged versions, \Nand first half only versions.

0.5;This is a simple version \Nof a bank robbery plot.

0.5;You were lying when you said \Nyou sold perfect crimes.

0.5;Don't forget that I'm just \Na crime novel adviser.

0.5;Hamanaka Misao, you're \Nunder arrest for abetment.
0.5;No matter what you say, your \Nplots are causing actual crimes.
0.5;Were you working as a criminal \Nadviser without even knowing that?
0.5;How you're treated after incarceration, \Ntestimony during the trial,
0.5;A lot of things that will shape your \Nlife are about to happen to you.
0.5;Hey, Takagi. Are you sure \Nyou needed an adviser?
0.5;We found detailed information on \Nthe suspects and their methods.
0.5;We've received strong information \Nrelating to a number of unsolved cases!
0.5;Call on all officers and \Narrest all the suspects!
0.5;The suspect's name is Wada Tatsumi, \Nforty-eight years old, single.
0.5;He has three previous offenses \Nand is currently unemployed.
0.5;The scheduled time of his \Ncrime is today at 4 PM.
0.5;Since it's just after three now, \Nwe don't have much time left.
0.5;The method is to use an odorless \Ngas to blow up an entire building.
0.5;There's even a blueprint \Nshowing a remote detonator.
0.5;Ishigami Takashi was Wada's superior at \Na company he worked for ten years ago.
0.5;Apparently he believed he was \Nresponsible for Wada's firing.
0.5;The police are already heading to the \Nsuspect's house and the target's office.
0.5;Wada's apartment is empty. \NThe suspect isn't here.
0.5;We've secured the alleged target Ishigami-san, \Nbut there hasn't been any unusual activity.
0.5;The suspect Wada is attempting \Nto cause a gas explosion.
0.5;Search every nook and cranny \Nfor hidden gas cylinders.
0.5;According to the plot, a lot of people \Nwill get caught up in the explosion.
0.5;We must do whatever it takes \Nto stop the explosion.
0.5;Nothing was found at \NIshigami-san's workplace.
0.5;On top of that, we haven't \Ndetermined the suspect's location.
0.5;I told you, as long as my customers \Nfollow my instructions,
0.5;Tell me every last word \Nthat was said. Got it?
0.5;Oh, right. He said he wanted the detonation \Nto be controlled remotely instead of automatic.
0.5;Perhaps he wants to deal \Nthe killing blow himself.
0.5;Wada clearly stated that his \Ntarget was Ishigami-san, right?
0.5;I write my plots after listening \Nto my customers' requests.
0.5;Isn't guarding the target and waiting for \Nthe suspect to arrive our best option?
0.5;Detective Takagi is right, \Nbut something's off...
0.5;Let's assume he heard of \Nyour reputation somewhere.
0.5;You may hate someone for firing you, but \Nusually you wouldn't want to kill them.
0.5;The actions of a criminal hardly fall \Nwithin what's considered sensible.
0.5;A long time? How long \Nhave you been doing this?
0.5;W-Well, at the very least, I \Nthink it's been about ten years.
0.5;Does Hamanaka have something \Nto do with Wada's arrest?
0.5;It's the plot for the robbery \Nyou wrote seven years ago.
0.5;after attacking the black market \Nlenders that were his target,
0.5;the high performance security \Ncameras of the shopping mall
0.5;along his escape route \Ncaptured his escape vehicle,
0.5;Wada probably believed it was \Nyour fault that he was arrested.
0.5;Wada Tatsumi recently finished his \Nsentence and was released from prison.
0.5;Several days ago, he visited your office \Nfor the first time in seven years.
0.5;However, you didn't remember \Nthe robbery or Wada himself.
0.5;and the detonator you installed \Nin the air purifier was removed.
0.5;You were first arrested \Nfor a burglary, right?
0.5;When I examined the entrance \Nto Hamasaki-san's office,
0.5;In order to make a gas \Nheavier than air explode,
0.5;the detonator needed to be as \Nclose to the ground as possible.
0.5;Because you asked to make the detonator \Nremote controlled instead of automatic.
0.5;So I thought you'd be someplace \Nyou could see the explosion.
0.5;Wada Tatsumi, you're under \Narrest for attempted murder!
0.5;Thanks to you, we were able \Nto solve five cases at once.
0.5;Ultimately, Hamasaki's perfect crimes \Nturned out to be armchair theories.

0.5;Yep! I'm a rich kid who's ignorant\Nof his debt to his old man!
0.5;I sure am jealous!\NGoing scuba diving as a couple!
0.5;Well, if I wasn't rich, there's no\Ntelling how she'd have wound up...
0.5;Hey, Ran-neechan.\NWhere's the old man fishing anyway?
0.5;He said it was the best spot\Nin the area and left before dawn...

0.5;Mori Kogoro! He's not\Njust a great detective!
0.5;She's up to that again?\NI thought she left.
0.5;Yeah. She does it\Nall the time. Lemme see.
0.5;She's trying to worry me.\NShe can be a real nuisance.
0.5;It's almost full tide.\NMaybe I should go again...

0.5;He said he was going to take me\Nto his special diving spot...

0.5;There were probably\Nsleeping drugs in the juice.

0.5;Maybe the cave has another\Nexit that they came in from?!
0.5;The old man's parrot fish\Nwas big but had no scars!
0.5;It entered the cave during\Nthe high tide before dawn!
0.5;It probably got washed through\Nthe cave and into that lake
0.5;A non-ocean fishing spot where\Nyou can catch ocean fish!
0.5;But the tide will catch up\Nif we don't hurry!
0.5;The louder echo was a dead-end.\NThe quieter one leads ahead!
0.5;Just wondering if\Nthe peak tide was in...
0.5;Don't let Kasuda-san\Nout of your sight.
0.5;Be sure to take your trash\Nwhen you leave!
0.5;Mister! Do you know the best\Nfishing spot around here?!
0.5;Now I see! We were at\Nthe top of the cave!
0.5;The water's flowing through\Nto the other exit now!
0.5;His life jacket! If I can\Njust get it off!
0.5;It won't rip! Isn't there\Nanything I can use?!
0.5;The water from the high tide\Nflows into the lake!
0.5;it also flows out during low\Ntide via another passageway!

0.5;And where in the building did\Nhe hide to avoid police detection?!
0.5;The mechanic will have an \Neasier time finding your car
0.5;at the station up ahead than \Nin the middle of the mountains.
0.5;We were planning on stopping there \Nto pick up groceries anyway.
0.5;Our college lab always \Ngoes camping together.
0.5;Komada-kun, you should get \Na smartphone already.
0.5;This time we're also celebrating the \Npublication of our professor's paper.
0.5;The world must be ending if that perverted \Ndrunkard is being recognized.
0.5;Besides, it's not like you guys \Nlike the professor either.
0.5;"""If only the professor would \Ndisappear from this world."""
0.5;Inscribing love and cases \Nwith deductive reasoning!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;I was just thinking about \Nbringing the car around—
0.5;Goto-san, who had been sleeping inside \Nthe car, slid down in his seat,
0.5;causing his phone strap to strangle \Nhim, resulting in his death?
0.5;Komada-san, you were the last \Nperson to get out of the car.
0.5;While getting out of the car, I thought \Nthe air inside was a little cold,
0.5;Come to think of it, I didn't recognize \Nthe air cushion the professor was using.
0.5;He said he'd hurt his back recently, \Nso maybe he bought it for today.
0.5;Inoue-san, you returned to the \Ncar before entering the store.
0.5;Not that I went inside and \Ngot a good look at him.
0.5;My wallet was on the seat, \Nso I left immediately,
0.5;In other words, he fell \Nfrom his seat after that.
0.5;Finally, Saeki-san, you went to \Nthe convenience store next door
0.5;to buy cigarettes after \Nyou finished shopping?
0.5;I returned to the car after \Nhaving a smoke over there.
0.5;We saw him smoking \Ncigarettes. Right, Ran-neechan?
0.5;Yeah. From right around here, \Nwhen we gave them our gift.
0.5;Come to think of it, did Goto-san \Nalways drink that much?
0.5;Every time he'd be plastered \Nby the time we arrived.
0.5;So that's why there aren't any signs of a \Nstruggle even though he was strangled.
0.5;Anyway, it seems strange to me \Nthat Goto-san's phone was found
0.5;open between the seat and headrest \Nwhen the body was discovered.
0.5;but his hand slipped,\Nand his phone ended up in that gap.
0.5;I got a call from the professor \Nwhile I was shopping.
0.5;Takagi-kun, investigate Goto-san's \Ncall history immediately.
0.5;Now that the professor who refused \Nto give you credits is gone,
0.5;And, Komada-kun, the professor was \Nawfully verbally abusive towards you.
0.5;Well, you complained that you wouldn't \Nforgive the professor for sexually harassing you!
0.5;Don't you remember what he \Nsaid last time he was drunk?
0.5;I can change your futures \Nwith a single word.
0.5;It sounds like all three of them felt \Nquite resentful towards the professor.
0.5;We found a call placed to Saeki-san \Nin Goto-san's phone history.
0.5;We're certain it was during \Nthe time he was shopping.
0.5;Mori-kun, did anyone approach \Nthe car while you were here?
0.5;No. I was next to the car the \Nwhole time since I was waiting
0.5;for the roadside assistance, \Nbut I didn't see anyone.
0.5;Sheesh. You're always \Nbarging into crime scenes.
0.5;They said he may have bought \Nit because he hurt his back.
0.5;Yeah, but there's a hole in it \Neven though it's brand new.
0.5;the surface of the cushion \Nwas slightly damp.
0.5;There weren't any other \Nwet spots on the seat.
0.5;It was damp because Goto-san \Nspilled liquor on it.
0.5;And the cushion was defective, so \Na hole opened while he was asleep.
0.5;It made him lose his balance \Nand fall from his seat.
0.5;Using that, they could've made the \Nvictim fall, even from a distance.
0.5;But without any evidence, this \Nwill be treated as an accident.
0.5;Anything that would definitively \Nprove they did it?
0.5;Which means they must \Nstill have it on them...
0.5;The conclusive evidence the \Nculprit used in their trick!
0.5;After reviewing the crime scene, \Nall uncertainties have been—
0.5;It's become clear to me that this is a \Nmurder made to look like an accident.
0.5;Goto-san didn't accidentally \Nfall from his seat.
0.5;Didn't you just say none of \Nthem could have killed him?
0.5;At first, that's what I believed, but \Nafter examining the inside of the car,
0.5;We couldn't have killed the professor, \Nwho was sleeping in the car.
0.5;All they needed to do was \Nslip the phone with the strap
0.5;through the gap between the headrest \Nand seat towards the back.
0.5;wasn't it a coincidence that \NGoto-san fell from his seat?
0.5;The culprit set up what you might call \Na timing device that caused Goto-san
0.5;to automatically fall from his seat \Neven if no one else was present
0.5;Dry ice sublimates from a \Nsolid directly into a gas,
0.5;causing its volume to expand \Nby a factor of 800.
0.5;The culprit packed said dry ice inside \Nthe air cushion and hid it on the seat.
0.5;As time passed, the cushion \Nbegan to expand like a balloon
0.5;The cushion was damp because the \Nlow temperature of the dry ice
0.5;and once it could no longer \Ncontain the gas, it burst.
0.5;Naturally, they experimented many times to \Ndetermine the exact amount they should use,
0.5;so it would all have turned to gas \Nby the time the body was discovered.
0.5;That's why the culprit used a certain \Npiece of outdoor equipment.
0.5;Using a cooler allowed the culprit to \Npreserve the dry ice until they needed it.
0.5;The individual with the cooler \Nwho used this trick...
0.5;You created an excuse to remain in the \Ncar and passed the open phone with strap
0.5;through the gap beneath the \Nheadrest towards the back.
0.5;and went shopping as though \Nnothing had happened.
0.5;I'm sure you calculated how \Nlarge the cushion would expand,
0.5;and how long it would take to \Nburst and bought one accordingly.
0.5;Surely you don't think I did it just \Nbecause I approached the professor.
0.5;And you said I passed the professor's phone \Nthough the gap and over the back of his seat.
0.5;Have you forgotten that the \Nprofessor called Saeki-senpai?
0.5;If his phone were back there, \Nhe couldn't have called anyone.
0.5;I never said it was the professor's \Nphone that was used.
0.5;I'm saying you're the one \Nwho called Saeki-san.
0.5;You swapped out your phone for Goto-san's \Nand used it to fabricate your alibi.
0.5;In other words, the phone attached to the \Nstrap that strangled Goto-san was yours.
0.5;you returned to the car while carrying \Nheavy bags full of groceries.
0.5;I was just thinking about \Nbringing the car around—
0.5;Didn't you wonder why he didn't \Nhave Saeki-san bring the car
0.5;in front of the store instead \Nof carrying so many heavy bags?
0.5;But, Komada-san, you went out \Nof your way to carry the bags.
0.5;It's because you needed to discover \NGoto-san's body with someone else,
0.5;for Goto-san's, which you used \Nto fabricate your alibi.
0.5;As the only other person with \Na flip phone like Goto-san's,
0.5;I knew something was off when you \Ndeliberately removed the phone from the strap.
0.5;but you gave up on the idea when Conan and \NI entered the car unexpectedly quickly.
0.5;Even if it was dry ice, there's \Nno evidence it was used!
0.5;I didn't find the damage you \Ndescribed on Goto-san's phone.
0.5;When Goto-san fell, the \Nphone dangling over the back
0.5;The shock sent those pieces \Nof plastic flying.
0.5;Komada-san, using an old \Nphone came back to bite you.
0.5;Which means a different phone \Nwas used in the crime.
0.5;One with dents that should \Nmatch those pieces of plastic.
0.5;He told me to keep my mouth shut if I wanted \Nto keep doing research at the university.
0.5;Since I was a child, I dreamed \Nof becoming a researcher!
0.5;Even if I can't stay here, can't I at \Nleast go to a lab at another university?
0.5;I ignored my research to repeatedly \Nexperiment and perfect this method.
0.5;I guess I wasn't a good enough \Nresearcher after all.
0.5;If you didn't know where we were going, \Nyou should've followed the police.
0.5;I'm not doing something as pathetic \Nas asking the police for help.
0.5;We even have a GPS! How \Ndoes this even happen?
0.5;Wh-What? You're staking out \Na counterfeiting operation?!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Disappearing Detective Boys!"""

0.5;After finishing her shift, Sergeant \NMiike Naeko sang away her troubles

0.5;I knew it. I'd sensed an \Nodd presence recently.
0.5;Looks like you chose the \Nwrong target for your trap.
0.5;There was also a mark that led us to believe \Nthe body had been pointing at something.
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""Target: MPD Transportation \NDepartment, Part Two!"""
0.5;Yeah, apparently they were \Nhigh school classmates.
0.5;You called them a bunch of times \Nwhile we were at the karaoke box.
0.5;Yeah, that's right. You \Nshould join us, Yumi-san.
0.5;I think she works as a \Nhostess in Ginza these days.
0.5;I told them to call her something \Nelse since it's confusing.
0.5;So, you really have no idea if \Nanyone resented Sergeant Momosaki?
0.5;I can think of way too many people who \Nmight have resented her, justified or not.
0.5;Fifth Street is right next to \Nthe Mori Detective Agency.
0.5;The first was Aono Kengo-san, who was \Nnot only using his phone while driving,
0.5;who was driving a vehicle with an expired \Ninspection without a seat belt on.
0.5;Since they tried to flee before \Nthey were issued tickets,
0.5;they were forced to arrest them \Nfor interference of public duties.
0.5;Sergeant Momosaki felt someone had been \Nfollowing her since about a week ago, too.
0.5;I thought the old man \Nmight have seen something,
0.5;but a week ago he was off on a trip \Nwith the neighborhood association.
0.5;The victim was a female police officer \Nwith the transportation department.
0.5;I find a kid who barges into a \Ncrime scene far scarier, Kudo-kun.
0.5;They said you'd be here \Nif you weren't at home.
0.5;Well? What do the exceptional \Npolice want with me?
0.5;You'll follow the established rules \Nand accept the judgment of the law.
0.5;has been discovered in an alleyway \Noff Third Street in Haido City.
0.5;All officers and patrols in the \Nneighborhood, please head to the location.
0.5;I happened to be in the area, \Nso I came to the scene.
0.5;The victim is Lieutenant Yagi Shiori \Nof the MPD Transportation Department.
0.5;And next to her body is a 100 \Nyen coin stuck inside her phone.
0.5;Just like the one found next \Nto the body of the officer
0.5;discovered in the park this \Nmorning, it was deliberately bent.
0.5;100 yen coins are engraved \Nwith a cherry blossom.
0.5;It goes without saying that the cherry \Nblossom is the emblem of the Japanese police.
0.5;This case is a serial murder \Nof female police officers.
0.5;Someone died at the bottom \Nof an apartment building.
0.5;The victim was MPD Transportation \NDepartment Lieutenant Yagi Shiori,
0.5;Judging by the body's condition, \Nshe died from the fall.
0.5;She was probably pushed from this \Napartment building's external stairs.
0.5;Not only that, but like the body of Sergeant \NMomosaki that was discovered this morning,
0.5;it's extremely likely that these crimes were \Ncommitted by an individual who resents the police.
0.5;Don't overlook any illegal activity \Nwhen you arrest the suspect.
0.5;Yeah. We'll start with \Nthis apartment building.
0.5;Commissioner Kuroda, we'll see you \Nlater at the investigation meeting.
0.5;In that case, it would be more natural \Nfor the wound to be facing the ground,
0.5;but it's currently facing upwards, \Nin the opposite direction, instead.
0.5;Then there's this. The victim's \Nhand is reaching towards her phone.
0.5;It's not standard for a person to use \Na touchscreen without looking at it.
0.5;her head would be facing \Nleft, towards her phone.
0.5;But she's facing right, preventing \Nher from seeing the screen.
0.5;Sometimes the shock from a fall can cause \Na person to face a different direction.
0.5;It's also still unclear what she was \Nattempting to do with her phone.
0.5;There aren't any large visible \Nwounds on the victim's face.
0.5;But there appears to be some kind of \Nscratch on just the tip of her nose.
0.5;Similarly, the lipstick around her mouth is \Nsmudged as though it was wiped in one direction.
0.5;It's as if she forced herself to face right \Nwhile scraping her face against the ground.
0.5;Maybe she followed the direction \Nthe suspect fled with her eyes.
0.5;We'll have forensics examine \Nher phone immediately.
0.5;We'll be pretty late by \Nthe time we head there.
0.5;I'm not surprised no one's talking \Nabout some traffic violations.
0.5;There was a commotion at that \Nintersection over there.
0.5;Could you tell me more \Nabout what happened then?
0.5;Conan-kun wants to know more about the \Ncommotion that happened at the intersection a week ago.
0.5;Apparently there were three \Ntraffic violators in a row.
0.5;"They said, ""We'll question you all at \Nonce, so come down to the station."""
0.5;"""We've got your license plate numbers, \Nso there will be hell to pay if you run."""
0.5;and forgot his license cried \Nthat his neurotic girlfriend
0.5;was waiting for him and asked \Nto be allowed to leave.
0.5;The man driving against traffic without \Na helmet shouted that his ex-wife
0.5;was being abused by her new boyfriend \Nand demanded they let him go rescue her.
0.5;The man driving with an expired inspection \Nwithout a seat belt was panicked
0.5;Both of the female officers they \Nwere arguing with were murdered.
0.5;Did any of those three men \Nparticipate in sports like baseball
0.5;The first female officer murdered in \Nthe park was pointing at a swing set.
0.5;Oh, right. We say we swing \Nbaseball bats and golf clubs.
0.5;And getting into a jazz rhythm \Nis also called swinging.
0.5;Not only that, but he's a \Npretty shrewd private eye.
0.5;You lost the moment I saw through \Nyour disguise as Okiya Subaru.
0.5;What if I knew you'd try \Nto sneak in here today?
0.5;It's likely the suspect is going \Nafter female police officers.
0.5;You two are both in the \NTransportation Department, too.
0.5;They're calling the three traffic \Nviolators they arrested a week ago,
0.5;Like expressing something by \Nturning her head like this?
0.5;Who knows? I've never \Nheard anything like that.
0.5;Contact me immediately if you notice \Nanything after seeing the photo.
0.5;I'm going out canvassing after \Nthis, so I'm counting on you.
0.5;It's true. It looks like she \Nforced her head to turn.
0.5;This is the alleyway off Third \NStreet in Haido City, right?
0.5;You kept calling every ten \Nminutes, so I blocked you.
0.5;The news just said another \Nfemale officer had been killed!
0.5;He was here today at the \Nshogi hall for an interview.
0.5;In any case, you should hurry home and only \Nthink thoughts about your upcoming title match.
0.5;Yumi-tan, you should head \Nhome early today, too.
0.5;You were up all night playing mahjong at my \Nplace last night, so you haven't gotten much sleep.
0.5;And if you don't hydrate enough, \Nit's not good for your skin.
0.5;I've got someplace to stop \Nby. You can leave without me.
0.5;No. At the time of the crime, most \Nof the residents weren't home.
0.5;Then we'll canvas the \Nneighboring residents, too.
0.5;but since I'm helping the \Ninvestigation, go easy on me.

0.5;but it also seems that\Nthe victim wasn't so easily fooled!
0.5;In that case, give us your alibi.\NWhere were you at 4:30?
0.5;I was alone in the office, doing work\Nthat Mr. Ochiai asked me to do...
0.5;Then that means nobody\Nsaw you, doesn't it?
0.5;Hold on! What motive would\NI have for killing the owner?!
0.5;There's no point in trying to talk\Nyour way out of this, Kubota-san!
0.5;The owner threatened\Nto sue you for damages
0.5;because you were secretly\Nselling this museum's exhibits!
0.5;The truth will come to light once\Nmy men find the suit of armor.
0.5;Inspector Megure!\NThere's a ballpoint pen over here!
0.5;in celebration of Beika Art\NMuseum's 50th anniversary.
0.5;Both colors and widths\Nare exactly the same.
0.5;Kubota-san should have known\Nabout the security camera,
0.5;especially if it meant wearing armor\Nto conceal his identity?
0.5;Would such a person actually\Ndo something like this?
0.5;Hey, little boy!\NYou can't just barge in here!
0.5;Inspector Megure says he wants you\Nto help with something else.
0.5;He must've figured out we really\Nwanted to watch the tape.
0.5;What's on the card that\Nhe's so shocked about?!
0.5;Why did he throw the pen away\Nwhen he finished writing?
0.5;The killer would have realized he\Nwas there if he made any sounds...
0.5;It's unnatural for someone\Nwho's about to be killed
0.5;to retract the pen tip\Nof a twist-style ballpoint pen!
0.5;We found the armor\Nin Kubota-san's locker!
0.5;This is crazy!\NI don't know anything about this!
0.5;We have two major pieces\Nof evidence that point to you!
0.5;This blood-smeared suit of armor,\Nand the victim's dying message!
0.5;It's a trick the killer used\Nto put the blame on Kubota-san!
0.5;It's a shame that this\Nwork of art was ruined.
0.5;Actually, that's a replica\Nused for decoration purposes.
0.5;I believe it was the same one\NKubota-san was moving this afternoon.
0.5;That's why the museum manager\Ndidn't say anything
0.5;when he handled\Nthe armor so violently.
0.5;It seems none of the other\Nexhibits have been touched, either.
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nthe wall where he was killed...
0.5;To protect them from\Nthe blood during the attack.
0.5;The killer really was one\Nof the staff members!
0.5;This is a trick that doesn't work\Nwithout nulling Kubota-san's alibi.
0.5;there's a possibility\Nthe murderer might still have it...
0.5;For now, you'll have to\Ncome down to the station.
0.5;But that's strange. Why did you have\Na pen that you knew didn't work?
0.5;It looks like someone scribbled over\Nthe letters with a pen that didn't work!
0.5;Aha! This wasn't written\Nby Mr. Manaka at all!
0.5;It was written beforehand\Nby none other than the killer!
0.5;But then why did he take\Nthe card in the first place?!
0.5;"""Look at the card behind you!\NThe name of your murderer is on it!"""
0.5;But the card had Kubota's name on it,\Nnot the name of the killer!
0.5;Shocked, he tried to cross out the\Nname and replace it with the real one
0.5;So, that's why he threw the pen away\Nand tried to crumple up the paper!
0.5;In short, this was all a trick\Nto fool us, perpetrated by the killer
0.5;using a pen without ink and\Na video tape without sound!
0.5;Wasn't the tip of that pen\Nretracted when we found it?
0.5;Strange for someone\Nwho's about to be killed
0.5;to go through all the trouble\Nof retracting a pen's tip...
0.5;So, the killer switched this pen\Nwith the other one after the murder,
0.5;but carelessly forgot\Nto put the pen tip out?
0.5;Which means whoever's currently\Nin possession of a pen that doesn't work
0.5;Everything that happened afterward\Nis exactly as you said, Detective.
0.5;Good thing everything\Nwas caught on tape!
0.5;Having Mr. Manaka stand\Nwhere he did, the timing,
0.5;the location of the card,\Nthe location of the pen...
0.5;They were all done\Naccording to my plan.
0.5;I practiced here on several\Noccasions, you see.
0.5;Then the rumor about\Nthe security guards
0.5;seeing the suit of armor\Nwalking late at night was real?!
0.5;but I did it for the purpose\Nof getting rid of Mr. Manaka,
0.5;the demon who was going\Nto shut down this divine museum
0.5;and take away from me all of these\Nexhibits that are like my own children.
0.5;And then there was Kubota-kun,\Nwho went and sold some of my exhibits.
0.5;It appears to be different\Nfrom the picture, Mr. Ochiai.
0.5;It seems you've been struck down\Nby divine punishment as well.
0.5;Although the knight of justice\Nhas slain the demon,
0.5;he has also been covered\Nin its evil blood,
0.5;which will soak into him\Nand make him wicked in turn.
0.5;No matter how you look at it,\NI am a murderer.
0.5;The fact that I was unable to deceive\Nthe small knight of justice
0.5;Say, little boy. Do you not need\Nto go to the restroom anymore?
0.5;Eh? The art museum's not\Ngoing to close after all?
0.5;Nope. The citizens all got together\Nafter they heard what happened.
0.5;That's good. We don't have many\Ncultural spots around here, after all.
0.5;It's always Conan\Nand that old man Kogoro!
0.5;about the biology room skeleton\Ncoming to life at midnight?
0.5;Okay! This is a case that calls\Nfor the Junior Detective Club!
0.5;There's no doubt about it!\NHe's the murderer!
0.5;Just what sort of alibi does\Nhe have in that camera?!
0.5;Sorry. My signal's weak, \Nso I couldn't reach them.
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!
0.5;A skeleton is discovered \Nat the bottom of a dam!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Do you remember the case of \Nthe Cursed Tears of Borgia?
0.5;Forty years ago, while Beika \NCity-based Yamato TV was
0.5;filming a show to commemorate \Ntheir fifth anniversary,
0.5;the leading lady went missing \Nwhile wearing a prop ring set
0.5;However, suspect Saeki Yuri-san has \Nbeen discovered after 40 years
0.5;as a skeleton at the \Nbottom of a dried up dam.
0.5;It was the title of the \Ndrama they were filming
0.5;when my grandmother allegedly ran off \Nwith the ring that was discovered.
0.5;under cover of night because of the \Nabuse they suffered from the media.
0.5;But the ring wasn't in the car \Nmy grandmother was found in!
0.5;Mizusawa, the man who found the \Nbody, is one of my drinking buddies.
0.5;Someone must've stolen the \Nring from her and killed her!
0.5;But if you could at least \Nclear my grandmother's name...
0.5;Not only that, but during \Nthat time, it was underwater.
0.5;As it stands, they're unable \Nto conclude that your
0.5;That knife undoubtedly took \NSaeki Yuri-san's life.
0.5;But when I think of how disappointed \Nmy mother will be...
0.5;Why was your grandmother suspected \Nof running off with the ring?
0.5;It was my grandmother's job to \Ntransport the ring from the
0.5;Yamato TV studio in Beika City to \Nthe dam where they were filming.
0.5;building that's being \Ndemolished right now, right?
0.5;Excuse me. You looked \Nlike an old acquaintance.
0.5;I can't believe we ran into an \Nacquaintance of your grandmother.
0.5;your grandmother's body was \Ndiscovered by my nephew Umeki.
0.5;so I came to see the Yamato \NTV building being demolished.
0.5;"Do you remember the drama \N""I Killed Them""?"
0.5;But doesn't Sumire-san want to know \Nif her grandmother was innocent?
0.5;It's all right. None of the staff \Nbelieved that Yuri-chan took the ring.
0.5;So they turned that lack \Nof knowledge on its head
0.5;"by calling ""Killed 'Em"" a ""five \Nyear anniversary special live drama."""
0.5;This industry has a habit \Nof abbreviating everything.
0.5;How long did the actress Asahina \NNagisa-san appear on TV?
0.5;She only debuted because she \Nwas a sponsor's daughter.
0.5;Nagisa-chan wasn't a bad girl,\Nbut she had terrible stage fright.
0.5;She always had her peel \Nthem to help her calm down.
0.5;But on that day, she traveled \Nseparately from Nagisa-chan
0.5;Because there were rumors the \NAsahina family had purchased
0.5;The Asahina family requested that Western \Nhistory Professor Senju proclaim it
0.5;The jewel had to be left at the studio \Nto accommodate the professor's schedule.
0.5;Yuri-chan would bring it to the filming \Nlocation once he gave his testimony.
0.5;As long as the Tears of Borgia arrived by \N20:20, it would be in time for the broadcast.
0.5;It was. It needed to arrive in time \Nfor its close-up during the climax.
0.5;Switching from studio to filming \Nlocation in three, two, one.
0.5;Yeah. It was Yuri-chan's \Nidea to help her calm down.
0.5;We didn't have time to rehearse, so \Nmemorizing lines was quite the job.
0.5;But ultimately, the ring \Nnever arrived, right?
0.5;Just in case, we brought \Nthe prop ring with us.
0.5;We were so distracted by the \Ncommotion after filming
0.5;You can't cancel a live \Nbroadcast for an illness.
0.5;You looked away for a minute, \Nand she disappeared?
0.5;She sometimes becomes panicked \Nbecause of an old trauma.
0.5;She mixes up her memories \Nof the present and the past.
0.5;Conan-kun's over there. \NHe's on the third floor.
0.5;She was supposed to be \Nfriends with my grandmother.
0.5;Something happened between the \Ntwo of them that traumatized her.
0.5;That's probably what \NShinichi-niichan would say.
0.5;"Sumire-san, do you know what \N""I Killed Them"" was about?"
0.5;"Back then, there was a notorious \Nthief known as ""Red Hood."""
0.5;Red Hood declared that he would \Nsteal the Tears of Borgia.
0.5;and no one knew what he looked \Nlike beneath his hood.
0.5;He'll find it if it's hidden, so \Nit should be kept in plain sight.
0.5;A fake jewel is locked \Ninside the mansion's safe,
0.5;while the real one is kept \Non the maid's finger.
0.5;While the thief waits for \Nan opportunity to strike,
0.5;the maid is sent to some distant \Nmountains by the master.
0.5;When you put it that way, \Nwe don't have a choice.
0.5;I'm first-rate Western \Nhistory professor Senju.
0.5;You're right. He must know \Nabout your grandmother.
0.5;You were the only saving grace of \Nthat incredibly unpleasant program.
0.5;That's right! I told you \Nbecause you didn't know!
0.5;but that the owners embarrass themselves \Nif they insisted it was real.
0.5;You're the only one who \Nlistened to me, Yuri-kun.
0.5;Didn't you say something \Nabout the whatever of Borgia?
0.5;I warned the Asahina family that employed \Nyou not to embarrass themselves.
0.5;You looked at me with your \Ncute round eyes and nodded.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NCursed Tears of Borgia, Part Two!"""
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!
0.5;A surprising case lies \Nat the end of the muzzle!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Mori-sensei just said he'd eat the \Nsandwiches as a late night snack.
0.5;Some rich guy is freaking out because \Nhe received a threatening letter.
0.5;I'm on my way to take these two to \Ntalk over dinner with said rich guy.
0.5;I heard a series of murders \Nhappened during your school trip.
0.5;It seems your classmate Kudo \NShinichi-kun helped solved the case.
0.5;I'm sorry. Our teachers told \Nus not to talk about Shinichi.
0.5;But I heard from Sonoko-san that \Nyou often go to his house to clean.
0.5;You should come with us \Nto talk about the case.
0.5;I think I left it by the \Nsandwiches I brought earlier.
0.5;I received a call from an acquaintance \Nwhile I was delivering the sandwiches.
0.5;Maybe it's a well-established \NWestern restaurant.
0.5;I wouldn't have brought Conan-kun if \NI'd known it was this kind of place.
0.5;You must be the great \Ndetective Mori Kogoro-san.
0.5;This is the threatening letter \Nmy master received the other day.
0.5;A threatening letter made from \Nclippings in this day and age, huh?
0.5;"""If you want to live, stay away \Nfrom the Black Rabbit Restaurant."""
0.5;Yes, so I invited a detective to find \Nthe scoundrel trying to kill me
0.5;But there's no guarantee you'll \Nbe attacked inside the restaurant.
0.5;If I'm going to be attacked, \Nit'll be inside this restaurant.
0.5;Why aren't your bodyguards \Nwith you right now?
0.5;If I brought a bunch of \Nstern-looking men in here,
0.5;Ah, Yuri-chan. I'm here for \Na special reason today.
0.5;Girls, you're all welcome to \Norder whatever you'd like.
0.5;He's wiping his glasses so \Nhe can stare right at them.
0.5;But everyone's drinks count as your \Nsales since Morooka-san ordered them.
0.5;It suddenly starting ringing \Nwhile I was checking my messages.
0.5;if you press the power and increase \Nvolume buttons simultaneously.
0.5;All the bunny girls keep their phones \Nin the backs of their outfits.
0.5;Customers call us all the time to \Nask if the restaurant's crowded.
0.5;He's been employed by my recently \Ndeceased wife's family for a long time.
0.5;No, actually. There's a clothing \Nstore next to this one.
0.5;I'll stop by to see the girls while \Ngetting a new suit made there.
0.5;Come on. Everyone's been waiting \Nfor you since you ordered.
0.5;Perhaps she got food poisoning \Nfrom the fruit she ate.
0.5;It's hard to believe only \NYuri-san got food poisoning.
0.5;Yuri-san said she was starving \Nsince she missed lunch.
0.5;There's not much cash in \Nit, but my house key...
0.5;If that were Yuri's, I would've \Ninvestigated its contents
0.5;to figure out where she's been \Nsecretly meeting Morooka-san.
0.5;I don't know what your relationship is with \NMorooka-san, but you should be careful.
0.5;So, do you have any idea who \Nmight've tried to kill the victim?
0.5;Yeah, but Yuri-chan was \Npoisoned instead of me.
0.5;But your glasses were \Ntotally different shapes.
0.5;Yuri-san's glass was a \Nskinny champagne glass,
0.5;Then Yuri-san really was the \Nculprit's intended victim.
0.5;Yuri-san collapsed after \Nreturning to the table
0.5;She covered her glass with a \Ncoaster before leaving the table.
0.5;It could only have been \Npoisoned by Morooka-san,
0.5;Or Fukamachi-san, who was sitting \Nnext to her when she placed her glass
0.5;It suddenly starting ringing \Nwhile I was checking my messages.
0.5;Or Murakami-san, who spilled \Nred wine on her white cuffs
0.5;and created a reason for \Nher to leave the table.
0.5;And sometimes we call them to \Ninvite them to the restaurant.
0.5;only those three could've \Npoisoned Yuri-san's glass.
0.5;We'll be asking you in greater \Ndetail about what happened.
0.5;Like Amuro-san said, one of \Nthose three must be the culprit.
0.5;He said he needed to talk to Yuri-chan, \Nand they headed out back together.
0.5;Amuro-san, what's wrong? \NYou've been acting strange.
0.5;Summer vacation ends with \Na child-turned-bunny girl?
0.5;Four eyes, did you get in trouble \Nfor doing something bad?
0.5;He was delivering a wallet \Nhe found in the street.
0.5;All the good machines were taken \Nwhile I overslept a little.
0.5;Oh, the lying stand-up\Ncomedian DoDonPa-san.
0.5;My talent agency's office \Nis right down the street.
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;The comedian who turned himself in \Nreceives a surprisingly evaluation.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;The Comedian Who Turned\NHimself In, Part One!
0.5;I had the housekeeper Ueki-san \Nprepare an open room for us.
0.5;The Beika Station seems to be a \Nmess with all the other cases.
0.5;The late Hideki Tendo-san operated \Na talent agency out of that room,
0.5;He worked closely with me as\Nmy president and manager.
0.5;and today we were going to meet \Nso I could show him what I had.
0.5;The difference in our senses \Nof humor led to an argument,
0.5;murdered the president of his talent\Nagency and turned himself in?
0.5;We'd just be wasting our \Ntime if we stayed here.
0.5;would someone strike their \Npartner with a metal bat?
0.5;There might be an opportunity \Nfor a great detective.
0.5;It's a ten minute walk from the \Nstation to the crime scene,
0.5;They immediately got in an \Nargument, and he killed him.
0.5;He returned to the police \Nbox near the station
0.5;I'm going to hit up his \Nentertainer friends next,
0.5;and ask if there was any trouble \Nbetween him and the victim.
0.5;So DoDonPa-san had a grudge \Nagainst Tendo-san over that?
0.5;I was invited to be a regular \Non a famous variety program,
0.5;but he turned the offer down\Nbecause he didn't like the program!
0.5;In other words, there had been friction \Nbetween you and Tendo since then.
0.5;Otherwise I wouldn't have \Nsuddenly hit him with a bat.
0.5;This wasn't here when I was tidying up \Naround the rear entrance this morning.
0.5;They use these kinds of things \Nat construction sites, right?
0.5;The weapon. \NApparently it's not the metal bat.
0.5;When comparing the weapon to the victim's \Nhead injury during the autopsy,
0.5;the fragments of concrete in the wound on \NTendo's head match those stuck to the pipe.
0.5;the metal pipe at the rear entrance was\Nthe actual weapon used to kill Tendo.
0.5;It seems this person is determined \Nto be the murderer
0.5;Does that mean he knows who the real \Nmurderer is and is protecting them?
0.5;Mister Housekeeper, Inspector Megure \Nwanted me to ask you something.
0.5;There's been hardly any traffic \Nover the long holiday.
0.5;Did DoDonPa-san not see \Nthe real murderer in person?
0.5;The only people coming\Nand going this morning
0.5;were the Mori-san couple \Nleaving for their trip,
0.5;Can you tell what kind of \Nlunch you heated up for him?
0.5;Tendo-san always gets his \Nhot water at the store.
0.5;Oh, right. Around 9:00, I \Nwas at Suda-sensei's studio.
0.5;based on the digestion \Nof his stomach contents,
0.5;Tendo-san was killed about \Nan hour after he ate.
0.5;He bought both of those at the \Nconvenience store at 7:58.
0.5;and he put hot water in his \Ncup noodles at the store,
0.5;so he must have eaten them \Nas soon as he got back.
0.5;Around 8:00 AM, Tendo-san ate \Nhis lunch and cup noodles.
0.5;DoDonPa-san, Tendo-san wasn't \Nkilled after 11:00 like you said,
0.5;She's an artist who lives in \NAkebono City in my neighborhood.
0.5;Takagi-kun, meet up with \NChiba-kun and head there.
0.5;Looks like you didn't get \Nyour chance to shine, Mister.
0.5;He said he was a comedian, \N but I don't know any performers.
0.5;After all, I don't have a \NTV, radio, or cell phone.
0.5;We want to know if DoDonPa-san \Nvisited you this morning.
0.5;he had borrowed to help \Nhim come up with ideas.
0.5;He called last night to say he \Nwould be by at 9:00 the next day.
0.5;Here are the art books I \Nborrowed and some cake you like.
0.5;That clock wasn't broken, and it's over \Nan hour's drive to the crime scene.
0.5;Does that mean you know \Nwho the real murderer is
0.5;You should think hard about \Nwhich would be better for you.
0.5;If they looked for the murderer, \NTendo-san's foul other face would be revealed.
0.5;I could tell he had died to a blow to\Nthe head, but the weapon was gone.
0.5;In order to make the weapon seem like \Nthe bat that happened to be in the room,
0.5;and turned myself in at the \Npolice box near the station.
0.5;Who was Tendo extorting, \Nand what was he using?
0.5;However, right now the murder \Ninvestigation comes first.
0.5;We'll investigate your actions \Nafter the case is solved.
0.5;the most obvious suspect is the \Nperson Tendo-san was extorting.
0.5;There was never any opportunity \Nfor a great detective to shine.
0.5;But I wonder why the murderer took the \Nreal murder weapon out of the room.
0.5;Then they should have \Ntaken it all the way home,
0.5;but it was left at the storage \Narea by the rear entrance.
0.5;That's why the housekeeper \Nfound it right away.
0.5;They didn't want to leave \Nit at the crime scene,
0.5;but it was left at the rear entrance of the \Napartment where the crime took place,
0.5;In order to protect the \Nreputation of Hideki Tendo,
0.5;I, DoDonPa Rokusuke, wanted \Nto be called his murderer.
0.5;What that intent,\N I falsely turned myself in.
0.5;All of Japan understands \Nhow you feel, DoDonPa-san.
0.5;Hey, how did you guys know \NDoDonPa-san turned himself in?
0.5;Every station received an \Nanonymous tip by phone.
0.5;I can't imagine that policeman \Nleaked the information,
0.5;Maybe his goal wasn't to become the \Nculprit of a murder he didn't commit,
0.5;after saying the previous \Nnight he would stop by at 9:00.
0.5;9:00 AM, the exact same time \NTendo-san was murdered.
0.5;The metal pipe that was used as \Nthe murder weapon is on his mind.
0.5;There was a construction site \Non the way from Beika Station.
0.5;I thought it might help \Nyou find the murderer.
0.5;At this rate, I won't be \Nable to protect Tendo-san.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is “The \NComedian Who Turned Himself In, Part Two!"""

0.5;I always had bug spray on hand\Nto keep wasps from coming inside.
0.5;There've been many wasp-related\Nincidents so far this year.
0.5;Listen... President Yamazaki\Nmust've been attacked
0.5;by wasps that entered\Nthrough that fireplace.
0.5;but in her panic, she went\Nthrough the window and onto the veranda.
0.5;Then, as luck would have it,\Nthe handrail broke and she fell over.
0.5;But why did she escape\Nthrough the window and not the door?
0.5;When people panic, they lose\Nthe ability to make good judgments.
0.5;The rain cap that should\Nbe on this chimney is gone.
0.5;Ah! Now I see how the trick worked!\NThat person is the killer!
0.5;You always worry us\Nwhen you suddenly disappear!
0.5;Hold on. Have a nap\Nand leave the rest to me, old guy.
0.5;To catch the killer off guard.\NI wanted time to gather proof, you see.
0.5;The person responsible\Nmurdered President Yamazaki
0.5;What about it?\NNothing seems out of the ordinary...
0.5;If wasps attacked you inside,\Nyou would normally run out the door.
0.5;But there were a bunch of\Nwasps on the honey-covered doorknob,
0.5;It had been corroded in\Nadvance using sulfuric acid.
0.5;It's the balloon you and Conan\Nsaw on your way down to the river.
0.5;The killer put wasps into\Nthe bag attached to the balloon
0.5;They were probably gathered\Nafter spraying them with ether.
0.5;I found a beekeeper outfit\Nthat smelled of ether in the shed.
0.5;Then what are the\Nhelium tanks in the shed for?
0.5;We made balloons for\Nkids at the summer festival.
0.5;Are you sure you didn't do\Na lot of test flights of a balloon
0.5;What's that supposed to mean?\NWhat are you trying to say?!
0.5;Yes! You're the killer,\NAihara-san!
0.5;I was with all of you!\NHow could I have killed her?!
0.5;First, to temporarily keep\Nthe balloon inside the chimney,
0.5;you tied fishing line to it,\Nled it to the downstairs kitchen
0.5;through a small hole in the floor\Nby the fireplace, and tied it to a nail.
0.5;The phone rang, and President\NYamazaki went to the upstairs office.
0.5;After confirming that\Nshe had picked up the receiver,
0.5;The tape covering a pre-made\Nrip in the bag came off
0.5;The balloon blocked the chimney's top,\Nso they flew into the room.
0.5;The agitated wasps then\Nattacked President Yamazaki.
0.5;While spraying the insecticide,\Nshe headed for the door.
0.5;But she was unable to open it.\NBecause it was crawling with wasps.
0.5;With no other choice, she ran\Naround the room, broke the window,
0.5;She leaned against the rail\Nand aimed the spray at the wasps,
0.5;After we rushed outside,\Nyou quickly returned to the kitchen
0.5;And so the balloon\Nwent flying out of the chimney.
0.5;That's what Ran\Nand Conan happened to see.
0.5;The balloon was supposed to\Nfly far off into the distance,
0.5;Aihara-san. Could you\Nshow us the towel on your hip?
0.5;The doorknob must've been\Nentirely covered in honey.
0.5;Are you sure you didn't\Nwipe it away with your towel?
0.5;Please take out what's\Nin your right pants pocket.
0.5;That's the very same thread\Nthat undid the tape on the plastic bag.
0.5;The mayor and Conan\Nhad barged in just then,
0.5;It appears you didn't have\Ntime to dispose of the evidence.
0.5;That, or you lowered your guard\Nwhen it was deemed an accident.
0.5;Making me the caretaker because\NI saved her life was nice and all,
0.5;but I wound up like a worker\Nbee slaving away for the queen bee.
0.5;But she said she'd make\Nme manager of the spa resort,
0.5;But it was a lie. A big, fat lie.\NI couldn't stand it anymore.
0.5;I wanted to ruin tomorrow's\Nground-breaking ceremony.
0.5;Way to go, Dad! You solved the case!\NYou're a genius, as always!
0.5;Okay! Let's hit the\Nhot springs and get manlier!
0.5;Sleeping Kogoro gets to\Nshow off his mind and body!
0.5;The only thing you\Ncan show off is how to sleep...
0.5;There are two of everything,\Neven photo books and CDs!
0.5;But this was a sealed room!\NHow did the killer escape?!
0.5;We came to a bunny girl club called the Black \NRabbit Restaurant to meet the old man's client.
0.5;You're saying Morooka-san was \Nworried about something?
0.5;Yes. That's what his bodyguards \Nout in the parking lot told me.
0.5;He'd suddenly lose and gain weight, and was \Nfrequently tripping and injuring himself.
0.5;But if it's an honorable injury suffered while \Nmaking up with the friend you fought with,
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Oh, yeah. That's one of \NYuri-chan's fake nails.
0.5;The thing is, I seem to have \Nstepped on it somewhere.
0.5;I suggested she wear some \Ndifferent ones sometimes,
0.5;I unfortunately stepped \Non Yuri-san's fake nail,
0.5;Yeah, but apparently Amuro-san \Nfound it in front of the bathroom.
0.5;Well, you couldn't help stepping on \Na fake nail that fell on the floor.
0.5;It's not like we're walking around with \Nmagnifying glasses, Sherlock Holmes-style.
0.5;That's why the culprit was able \Nto poison Yuri-san's glass.
0.5;How many times do I have \Nto tell you, Inspector?
0.5;It's true that I passed by Yuri-chan \Nwhile she was holding her glass...
0.5;I just bumped into her \Nand spilled wine on her.
0.5;I wasn't wearing my glasses when \Nshe set her glass on the table.
0.5;It suddenly starting ringing \Nwhile I was checking my messages.
0.5;Even if I wanted to poison her glass, \NI didn't know which one was hers.
0.5;So why don't you let us go so we \Ncan visit her in the hospital?
0.5;I understand your concern, \Nbut you're just a customer.
0.5;So you say, but maybe she was \Nactually pushing for marriage,
0.5;If she dies, you'll become \Nthe restaurant's top earner.
0.5;Then the restaurant will \Npay you a big bonus, right?
0.5;I heard you're struggling to pay for \Nyour seriously ill father's surgery!
0.5;I'll do somethin' 'bout the \Nmoney for the surgery.
0.5;What? At least I'm not an old man who was \Ntrying to pay her to stop contacting him!
0.5;Some of the girls saw your butler \Nover there trying to pay off Yuri.
0.5;The three of you will remain here \Nfor questioning for a while.
0.5;After all, you're the only ones who \Ncould have poisoned Yuri-san's glass.
0.5;He passed by Yuri-san while heading to \Nhis car parked outside the restaurant
0.5;When we talked to the bodyguards \Nby his car earlier,
0.5;they said the rich man just came with \NKogoro-no-ojisan to get the glasses.
0.5;I would definitely be checking the \Ntime or glancing at the restaurant,
0.5;and there must be a huge commotion \Ninside the restaurant.
0.5;Even if she poisoned Yuri-san \Nwhen she spilled wine on her,
0.5;when Yuri-san covered \Nher glass with a coaster
0.5;and went to the changing room \Nto change her stained cuffs,
0.5;she wandered off somewhere to \Nanswer a call from a customer.
0.5;If it were me, I wouldn't \Nleave, no matter what.
0.5;After all, someone else might accidentally \Ndrink from the poisoned glass.
0.5;Which leaves the man sitting by \NYuri-san's glass the whole time.
0.5;It could only have been you, \NFukamachi Atsufumi-san the butler.
0.5;Weren't you listening to \Nwhat Fukamachi-kun said?
0.5;He wasn't wearing his glasses when \Nshe set her glass on the table.
0.5;How was he able to identify \Nher glass and poison it?
0.5;Fukamachi-san had something on him \Nthat could substitute for glasses.
0.5;No. I was just checking my \Nmessages on my phone then.
0.5;Hear that? He says the only \Nthing he had was his phone.
0.5;Conan-kun, they're in the middle \Nof an important conversation.
0.5;Yeah, but if I use the camera \Non the phone and zoom in
0.5;I can clearly see you all the \Nway down to your fingertips.
0.5;Come to think of it, Yuri-san always \Nwore fake nails with lilies.
0.5;B-But Fukamachi-kun wasn't \Nwearing his glasses
0.5;because I happened to step \Non them and break them.
0.5;If he knew you put sauce \Non your rolled omelets,
0.5;he could've placed the sauce \Nfar enough away from you
0.5;he could make it look like they \Nwere coincidentally stepped on.
0.5;He had you step on his glasses \Nin order to use that trick,
0.5;but probably also to distance \Nyou from the crime scene
0.5;You passed by Yuri-chan while she was holding\N her glass when you went to get the glasses,
0.5;He made Yuri-san set her glass on the \Ntable to check for an earthquake report,
0.5;It's likely he used two separate \Nphones to sound the alarm
0.5;I'm sorry, Fukamachi-san, \Nbut we'll need to search—
0.5;I bought a second one and \Npracticed countless times...
0.5;and you're already infatuated \Nwith that young girl.
0.5;I selfishly offered her \Nmoney to stay away from you,
0.5;With no other choice, I sent \Nthat threatening letter.
0.5;I thought if the girl you \Nwere chasing were harmed,
0.5;Don't tell me it's because they both \Nput sauce on their rolled omelets.
0.5;But the unique way they \Nhold their chopsticks...
0.5;the daughter you had while living in \NTottori for four years was Yuri-san.
0.5;If she learned to hold her chopsticks \Nby copying you as a child,
0.5;You lost and gained weight so you'd \Nhave to get your suits tailored.
0.5;You began tripping frequently so you'd \Ntear your suits and have to buy new ones.
0.5;It was all to create a reason to go \Nto the clothing store next door
0.5;so you could come here and \Nsee your daughter, wasn't it?
0.5;I didn't have to see how she held her chopsticks \Nto know instantly that she was my daughter.
0.5;She looked just like her \Nmother I eloped with.
0.5;I couldn't tell you I wanted to see \Nthe daughter I had when I eloped.
0.5;Besides, my wife and I never had children, \Nwhich made it all the more difficult.
0.5;Yuri-san has regained consciousness, \Nand her condition is improving steadily.
0.5;In a little while, let's go see \NYuri together and apologize.
0.5;It's all right. She'll forgive \Nyou if you explain why.
0.5;Anyway, I'm surprised you knew I was losing \Nand gaining weight to see my daughter.
0.5;When I was a kid, there was \Na doctor I wanted to see,
0.5;so I'd get injured on purpose \Nso I could go to her clinic.
0.5;My cash, my house keys, and \Neverything else was still inside.
0.5;You lost the moment I saw through \Nyour disguise as Okiya Subaru.
0.5;What if I knew you'd try \Nto sneak in here today?
0.5;and receive orders to \Ninvestigate Kudo Shinichi?
0.5;Looks like I'll have to pull the \Ntrigger to keep your mouth shut.
0.5;Why don't you enjoy a cup \Nof tea prepared by my wife?
0.5;What are you trying to \Ncatch with that giant net?

0.5;The old guy received a letter from\Nsomeone named Nakamura Misao,

0.5;The mansion really\Nwas full of mysteries.
0.5;One clock had had\Nsomething removed from it.
0.5;At exactly 11:00, all the\Ndigital clocks in the house rang.
0.5;The VCR's timer was\Nset for exactly one minute.
0.5;What's more, someone\Nseemed to be hiding in the attic!
0.5;ln the desk was a file filled \Nwith newspaper clippings
0.5;about the Goblins, a bandit gang that\Nhad disappeared ten years ago.
0.5;Demon, the name of the Goblins'\Nleader, was found on a golf bag.
0.5;Even stranger was\Nthe mirror affixed to the desk
0.5;and the hole in the wall\Ndirectly below the cuckoo clock!
0.5;Where is the key to\Nsolving these mysteries?!
0.5;"""The Case of the Mysterious\NBandit Mansion (Part 2)."""
0.5;the Bandits of the Wind\Nused to leave behind!
0.5;Oh, that's it! That's the\Nweird thing I saw the other day!
0.5;what these strange signs and\Ntricks Monjiro-san left behind mean!
0.5;The cuckoo clock that\Nsuddenly went off at 1:10...
0.5;And the three goblins\Nthat came out of the clock...
0.5;...and the L, N, and R that\Nwere engraved on their foreheads...
0.5;What is the key to answering\Nall these mysteries?
0.5;I didn't see any at all! They should\Nbe really easy to design, too!
0.5;Don't be stupid! There were\Ntwo big lions on the front door!
0.5;Seriously, if he collected all\Nthese animals, he wouldn't forget lions.
0.5;Nothing! I just remembered\Nsomething funny!
0.5;If I'm right,\Nit's truly a unique code!
0.5;If so, the letter O or the number 0\Nshould've come out of the clock!
0.5;Could the cuckoo clock's code\Nbe separate from the digital clocks'?
0.5;The answer might come\Nif we think hard into the night!
0.5;The digital clocks\Nall went off at 11:00 a.m.
0.5;"There's a crack on all the digital\Npanels after the digits ""110""..."

0.5;Hey. Maybe it's time\Nwe give up and go home?
0.5;Shut up! If you wanna\Ngo home, then go home!

0.5;"You're dumb. They're \N""king of all 100 beasts."""

0.5;Checking the lions\Nwill solve this mystery!
0.5;Monjiro-san probably got rid\Nof all unrelated lions in the house
0.5;So that's why some things\Nseemed broken or scraped away!
0.5;Then are the lions in question\Nthe ones on the front door?!
0.5;Yes! We should find something\Nif we check them out!
0.5;Besides, how do you\Nexplain that cuckoo clock?
0.5;"T-True. ""LNR"" doesn't\Nfit with the ""king"" thing."
0.5;Then how about a\NNaitou-san or a Saitou-san?!
0.5;It's neat! Changing the first letter\Nmakes completely different names!
0.5;Come to think of it, those\Ngoblins had letters on their heads.

0.5;Three similar words that start\Nwith L, N, and R, followed by 110?
0.5;"The cuckoo clock code was saying\Nto put L, N, and R before ""ight""!"
0.5;Something will happen if we shine\Na light on the right lion at night!
0.5;It's not very obvious,\Nbut it looks like it opens up.
0.5;It goes inside the mansion\Nthrough a hole in the wall!
0.5;Just keep shining the\Nlight with the door closed!
0.5;The light from outside\Nreflects off the mirror on the desk
0.5;and shines on the\Ncuckoo clock from below.
0.5;It must be set up to only work\Nat night, so the sun won't set it off.
0.5;Oh! That must be a present\Nour grandfather left for me!
0.5;It sure is fancy, though!\NIt's covered with gems!
0.5;If these are premium jewels,\Nit could be worth billions of yen!
0.5;...it's probably a stolen item that\NDemon, the leader of the Goblins,
0.5;The person who\Nlived here: Monjiro-san!
0.5;The figures that came\Nout of the cuckoo clock
0.5;looked just like the goblin figures\Nthe bandit gang always left behind,
0.5;"and it looks like he received a\Ngolf bag with the alias ""Demon"" on it!"
0.5;And I don't think either of them are\Nthe Misao-san who sent the letter.
0.5;"""I haven't been here long\Nand don't know the house well."
0.5;Yet, they knew how to open the old door,\Nand they live here together.
0.5;Plus, he thought the cuckoo\Ncame out at 10:50 instead of 1:10.
0.5;This is because he\Ndidn't see the clock directly.
0.5;Instead, he looked through the hole\Nand saw the clock in the mirror!
0.5;In short, when Misao-san mentioned\Nbeing watched by someone...
0.5;Besides, I think\NMisao-san is a woman.
0.5;Here! Look at the\Nstamp on this letter!
0.5;Oh! She licked it\Nwhen sticking it on here...
0.5;But I'm sure you had\Nthis all figured out already!
0.5;We came to get the last\Ntreasure our boss had held on to.
0.5;Yeah, when we disbanded,\Nhe gave us almost everything we stole,
0.5;but he kept the most\Nvaluable items all for himself.
0.5;And those would be\Nthe jewels on this watch?
0.5;He finally kicked the bucket,\Nso we decided to scour this house
0.5;he used to hole up in...\Nbut there was someone already here.
0.5;I assume it was the real Misao-san,\Nwho's locked in the attic now?
0.5;Yeah. When we tossed her\Nup there, she just kept wailing on
0.5;about how some great detective\Nwould be here soon to get us.
0.5;so I pretended to be her to\Nhave you solve the code our boss left.
0.5;After we contacted them,\Nthe local police rushed to the scene.
0.5;Still knocked out, the criminal\Nduo was carried into ambulances,
0.5;and Misao-san was rescued\Nfrom the attic, safe and sound.
0.5;Just as I thought, she was the\Ngirl in the photo with Monjiro-san.
0.5;Monjiro-san probably made\Nthe watch for you out of stolen jewels.

0.5;Three days ago, I think, when I \Nwent shopping at the supermarket.
0.5;Yesterday, he had sandwiches here \Nin the morning and evening.

0.5;It's the type of hat worn by \Ncooks who work with starchy foods,

0.5;A baker who doesn't interact \Nwith customers makes bread
0.5;early in the morning and makes more \Nas necessary in the afternoon.

0.5;But no matter how much I watched \Nyou, I couldn't figure it out.
0.5;So I followed you and examined the bread,\Nham, lettuce, and mayonnaise you bought.
0.5;Even when I tried to make them \Nwith the same ingredients,
0.5;How?! How do you make such \Ndelicious ham sandwiches?!
0.5;That's it. The rich flavor of \Nthe ham comes from olive oil.
0.5;So that's why there was \Nmiso in the refrigerator.
0.5;I see. The sauce complements \Nthe olive oil covered ham.
0.5;This is ordinary hot water, \Nand this is ordinary lettuce.
0.5;Have you noticed that if the \Ninside of the sandwich is cold,
0.5;you only feel the coldness \Ninstead of tasting the flavors?
0.5;I wasn't thinking about \Nthat while I was eating.
0.5;Using water the temperature \Nof bath water is the secret.
0.5;Furthermore, the lettuce will \Nkeep its crispness for longer,
0.5;I steam them slightly \Nbefore making sandwiches.
0.5;The bread will absorb all \Nthe moisture it lost.
0.5;I see. That's why they were warm \Neven though you didn't toast them.
0.5;Amuro-san was taking his \Ncafé job seriously, too.
0.5;It's good for eating in the store, \Nbut not great for takeout.
0.5;So please let me sell your \Nsandwiches at my store!

0.5;Yes! The fact I'm known this far\Naway puts me at a loss for words!
0.5;Yes, she's Sekine Mitsuko.\NMy best friend.
0.5;In that case, this is Dr. Tanaka.\NI asked him to examine the body.
0.5;And this is the famous\Ndetective, Mori Kogoro-san!
0.5;If it's not too much to ask,\NI'd love to have your help on this case.
0.5;That's great to hear!\NAfter all, this is a quiet little town!
0.5;We're not used\Nto incidents like this at all!
0.5;Umm, shouldn't\NI begin my examination?
0.5;Hmm... I can't say anything for\Nsure until we get to the hospital,
0.5;See? There are no external\Ninjuries or signs of a struggle at all.
0.5;If it had been a murder,\Nthere would've been a fight
0.5;as the killer tried\Nto throw her into the sea.
0.5;Yet, she doesn't have\Na single scratch on her.
0.5;She probably rowed out\Nto sea in a boat or something,
0.5;tied the rock to her feet,\Nand drowned herself.
0.5;He says he can't say much\Nbefore going to the hospital,
0.5;but it's like he's trying to force\Nthe idea she committed suicide.
0.5;Now, if you'll please\Ntake the body to the hospital...
0.5;Mitsuko wouldn't\Ncommit suicide! He killed her!
0.5;Are you saying\Nthat doctor is a murderer?
0.5;but then got engaged to the daughter\Nof the head of a major hospital!
0.5;He tried to force the idea of\Nsuicide in his examination just now,
0.5;and, judging from the body's condition,\Nit's very likely he killed her!
0.5;Very well, Miss. I, the great Mori Kogoro,\Nwill reveal his true colors
0.5;Are you really sure\Nyou can do that, old guy?
0.5;After my examination, it\Nappears she did drown to death.
0.5;Her estimated time of death\Nis just past 10:00 last night.
0.5;Is it true that you and the victim,\NMitsuko-san, had been dating?
0.5;I apologize. I should've\Nmentioned it at the very start.
0.5;I hear you're marrying the\Ndaughter of the head of a major hospital.
0.5;Did that not make\NMitsuko-san an obstacle?
0.5;It just seems strange\Nfor someone with a motive
0.5;to conduct an autopsy when it's\Nunclear if it was a murder or suicide.
0.5;No, a lack of external injuries\Nisn't enough. There isn't even a will.
0.5;Could you tell us where you\Nwere at her estimated time of death?
0.5;Last night, I was at a bar\Nwith a friend, from 8:00 to midnight.
0.5;By car, it'd take ten minutes\Nfrom that bar to the beach, one-way.
0.5;If you'd like, you can check\Nwith the owner and my friend
0.5;to see if I had left\Nmy seat for that long.
0.5;Come to think of it, just after 10:00\Nwas when we came to get you.
0.5;In other words, Mori-san,\Nyou can vouch for my alibi.
0.5;It's a perfect alibi... Is this\Nhis source of confidence?!
0.5;But you gave the estimated time\Nof death! I want a reexamination!
0.5;But you'll have to take responsibility\Nwhen I'm proven innocent.
0.5;Say, Detective. This might\Ntake a long time, so can I leave?
0.5;Also, can I borrow a bicycle anywhere?\NI want to explore this area!
0.5;a reexamination will\Nprobably give the same results.
0.5;There has to be some\Nsort of trick! Something...
0.5;Do you usually sit here\Nand stare at the ocean, Mister?
0.5;The only unusual thing is\Nthe trash that washes up every day...
0.5;Yeah, all the trash in these waters\Nwashes up here 'cause of the tide.
0.5;"An inner tube. It's still new;\Nis it ripped somewhere?"
0.5;And can I have a couple\Nof these empty plastic bottles too?
0.5;Yeah, dunno what you want\Nwith 'em, but take whatever you want.
0.5;The flow of the tide\Nand the deflated inner tube!
0.5;If my theory is correct,\Nthese plastic bottles should make it clear!
0.5;Just as I thought! That just leaves\Nthe store that sold the inner tube!
0.5;The reexamination produced\Nthe same results as mine, Mori-san.
0.5;Now, what do you have\Nto say for yourself, Mori-san?
0.5;Is suspecting innocent people\Nwhat all great detectives do?
0.5;No, just the restroom.\NDon't wanna wet myself...
0.5;I apologize for the wait, everyone!\NPlease come to the next room!
0.5;Changing rooms\Nto regain your bearings?
0.5;Now, then! Allow me to\Nreveal the truth of this incident!
0.5;But, Mori-san! Wasn't it proved\Nthat Dr. Tanaka has an alibi?!
0.5;Yes, he was at the bar at\Nthe victim's estimated time of death.
0.5;However, the actual\Ncrime took place elsewhere.
0.5;First, Tanaka-san called\Nher to a separate location
0.5;and knocked her out with\Nchloroform or some other drug.
0.5;As a doctor, obtaining\Nsuch drugs would be simple.
0.5;You then used rope to\Ntie a heavy rock to her feet,
0.5;placed her in an inner\Ntube with a small hole in it,
0.5;Immediately afterward, you\Nwent to the bar with your friend...
0.5;During that time, Mitsuko-san\Nfloated along the current, still alive.
0.5;There's a tidal current here\Nthat flows toward the swimming area.
0.5;So she was washed\Ntoward the beach while still alive.
0.5;The inner tube continued to\Ndeflate, and eventually,
0.5;Judging from the speed\Nat which the inner tube deflated,
0.5;She could've used the inner\Ntube to commit suicide herself!
0.5;Detective, show him a\Nphotograph of the victim's feet.
0.5;Tie your own feet,\Njust like in the photograph.
0.5;Normally, if you tie your own feet,\Nyou'll get a knot like Ran's.
0.5;Then why is the knot\Nin the photograph reversed?
0.5;It's because the killer\Ntied her feet facing her.
0.5;It was easy finding the shop\Nwhere you bought this inner tube.
0.5;This is the inner tube\NDr. Tanaka bought last week.
0.5;The shop woman clearly\Nremembered you buying it.
0.5;Enough not to wipe away\Nyour fingerprints from the inner tube!
0.5;Now then, why would your\Nfingerprints be on an inner tube
0.5;I wish we could've\Nstayed another day...
0.5;So, Dad! I don't mind if\Nyou take the wrong road again!
0.5;D-Don't be stupid! I didn't\Ntake the wrong road yesterday!
0.5;I got it! The sea called\Nus here to stay another night!
0.5;But you'd never take the\Nwrong road otherwise, right?
0.5;"Yeah! You couldn't help it;\Nthe sea called us here!"
0.5;Yeah, huh? I'd never take\Nthe wrong road otherwise!
0.5;Kiwako-san might've\Nbeen bitten by a sea snake!
0.5;The police cornered jewelry store \Nrobber Takatori Iwao in a warehouse.
0.5;But just as I was beginning to explain \Nmy reasoning as the Sleeping Kogoro...
0.5;Takatori kidnapped me so I could retrieve \Nthe stolen jewels from the body of Utsumi,
0.5;Didn't you steal 300 million \Nyen worth of jewels?
0.5;For less than half a share, \Nhe agreed to kill me.
0.5;When the countdown reaches zero, use your \Ndetective skills to produce an answer!
0.5;A kidnapping and someone\Nbeing pushed down a chimney!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Yeah. The body of his \Naccomplice Utsumi was there.
0.5;into trying to kill him for \Nless than half a share.
0.5;If that's true, then there's more \Nto this case than we thought.
0.5;Takagi, find the abandoned \Nfactory immediately.
0.5;Confirm Utsumi's death and search \Nfor clues to Takatori's whereabouts.
0.5;"Chiba, determine who this ""someone"" \Nis from their mutual acquaintances."
0.5;They're keeping him in the hospital \Nfor a few days for observation.
0.5;Then I'll ask a nurse if it's \Nokay for me to buy you a drink.
0.5;Takatori's goals are most \Nlikely acquiring his share,
0.5;and getting revenge on the \Nsomeone who betrayed him.
0.5;For less than half a share, \Nhe agreed to kill me.
0.5;The body inside the chimney belongs \Nto Takatori's accomplice Utsumi.
0.5;However, we haven't found any \Nclues to Takatori's location.
0.5;He worked at the jewelry \Nshop Takatori robbed.
0.5;But I'm starting to see \Nwhat's really going on.
0.5;Sheesh. You're quite the \Nmischievous boy, kid.
0.5;What?! You found Yamaga's \Nbody at Utsumi's apartment?
0.5;So you've already exchanged the jewels for \Ncash and are off to an elegant overseas vacation.
0.5;On the ground behind you \Nis the robbery accomplice
0.5;and suspect wanted for murder \Nand attempted murder.
0.5;I thought Takatori killed \Nhis accomplice Utsumi
0.5;and the buyer Yamaga who \Nleaked the information.
0.5;He was trying to kill me. \NI was defending myself.
0.5;There were footprints at Utsumi's apartment \Nin the broth of a spilled instant ramen cup.
0.5;by saying he could join you \Nand Utsumi in Hong Kong.
0.5;The cup noodles were just \Nlike someone else's crepe.
0.5;Kogoro-no-ojisan told me about his \Nreasoning that was interrupted.
0.5;there was a damning piece of \Nevidence captured by the cameras.
0.5;You finished your explanation \Nthat was interrupted.
0.5;You're right. I did have too \Nmuch to drink yesterday.
0.5;Where have you been?!\NWhat have you been doing?!
0.5;In other words, the body should \Nstill be hidden in this building!

0.5;"""The Radio Questions and \NConcerns Show, Solution Arc!"""
0.5;You're secretly scheming to prevent \Nme from becoming independent.
0.5;You only think of your programs \Nas tools to make yourself rich.
0.5;I suppose. It's clear that \Nthey found him disagreeable.
0.5;It's true that they don't \Nget along with Manda-san,
0.5;but I can't believe they'd kill \Nhis wife just to get at Manda-san.
0.5;Hurry up and eat your \Nfood. Then we're leaving.
0.5;It's true that Manda-san was trying to \Nprevent Inuyama-san from becoming independent.
0.5;if he really wanted to quit \Nworking for the station.
0.5;Kujirai-san didn't get along \Nwith Manda-san either, right?
0.5;That incompetent fool shouldn't \Nbe working in radio.
0.5;It's apparently about a drama Manda-san \Nput on while he was a director.
0.5;But it's an old story, so \NI don't know much about it.
0.5;This single drama made Yashiro-san \Nthink she owed Manda-san everything,
0.5;while also making Kujirai-san \Nthink he was incompetent.
0.5;Kogoro-no-ojisan said he'd like \Nto hear a recording of this drama.
0.5;Sure. I'll submit a request \Nto the records department.
0.5;That's why he drank even though \Nhe was about to go on the air.
0.5;And someone said during \Nthe post show meeting
0.5;that they wished Manda-san's wife's upstairs \Nneighbor could've heard the show, right?
0.5;They used the concern that was submitted \Nby coincidence in their plan.
0.5;It can't be coincidence that such \Na convenient concern was submitted.
0.5;The listener TM-san isn't the \Nvictim Manda Towako-san.
0.5;It's someone completely different \Nnamed Morikawa Tsugumi-san.
0.5;What does the famous Mori \NKogoro-san want with me?
0.5;Once I get the results of the \Ninvestigation I requested...
0.5;I don't know why, but the inspector told \Nme to wait because he was on his way.
0.5;since they found out the victim \Nwas Manda-san's wife, right?
0.5;I heard you asked my detectives \Nto bring Manda here.
0.5;in the case of Manda Towako-san's \Nmurder by her husband
0.5;The plot lurking behind it \Nmost likely began a month ago,
0.5;when Manda-san was brought \Nhere as the new producer.
0.5;When Manda-san was assigned to \Nbe the new producer of the show,
0.5;Inuyama-san, he told you \Nabout his wife then, correct?
0.5;At the welcoming party we were \Nsocially obligated to throw.
0.5;I met her the other day about the divorce, \Nand she wouldn't stop complaining.
0.5;Something about her obnoxious \Nupstairs neighbor at her apartment.
0.5;When they heard that, the culprit \Ncame up with their plan.
0.5;They'd murder Manda-san's \Nwife and frame him for it.
0.5;Why would I frame Manda-san \Nwhen I owe him everything?
0.5;to the residents of Manda \NTowako-san's apartment building,
0.5;They said half a month ago \Nyou were asking around
0.5;about Manda Towako-san's upstairs \Nneighbor Kijima Kumi-san.
0.5;They said they told you that Kijima-san \Ngoes barhopping every Friday night.
0.5;That's why you decided to \Ndo it on a Friday, isn't it?
0.5;Just because I asked about Kijima-san, \Nthat doesn't make me the culprit.
0.5;I checked in with your friend \NMorikawa Tsugumi-san.
0.5;You asked Morikawa Tsugumi-san \Nbecause her initials are TM.
0.5;Nothing will happen if this \Ndoesn't get picked up first.
0.5;Once the submission arrived at the station, \Nyou selected it for Friday's show.
0.5;it was your responsibility to \Nselect submissions for the show.
0.5;Yesterday, on the day of your crime, you \Ngave a plausible excuse to make me drink.
0.5;They say Mori-san performs better \Nwhen he's had a drink or two.
0.5;After inciting me to make rude \Ncomments during the show,
0.5;I wish the woman living \Nabove Manda-san's wife
0.5;You incited Kijima Kumi-san to \Nfight with Manda Towako-san.
0.5;They don't even know \Nthey're being manipulated.
0.5;But, Mori-kun, even if she plotted to \Nframe Manda-san for his wife's murder,
0.5;not having an alibi wasn't a compelling \Nenough reason to suspect him.
0.5;Naturally, Kijima-san would \Nbe suspected for a while,
0.5;but her alibi would be verified since \Nshe spent her Fridays barhopping.
0.5;But the police were struggling \Nto verify her alibi.
0.5;from Kijima-san to Manda-san \Nwas quickly as possible.
0.5;in case the police took too long to \Nverify Kijima-san's alibi, didn't you?
0.5;It's true that they don't get \Nalong with Manda-san, but
0.5;because you were desperate \Nto frame Manda-san.
0.5;When suspicion fell on Manda-san \Nbecause of the CD...
0.5;When we learned Kijima-san was innocent, \Nand Manda-san was the only suspect...
0.5;You touched the band-aid \Non the back of your neck.
0.5;Manda-san's wife's maiden \Nname was Adachi Towako-san.
0.5;Seven years ago, she played the \Nleading role in your debut work.
0.5;which means it must have something \Nto do with the crux of this case.
0.5;It's a masterful depiction of a person's \Nfeelings for the lover they suddenly lost.
0.5;But once it became a drama, you \Ncouldn't stand to listen to it.
0.5;Because the director didn't \Nunderstand any of it.
0.5;And Adachi Towako-san's \Ninfantile performance.
0.5;I told the producer from the \Nstart that she couldn't do it.
0.5;I checked with Kamio Yoshitaka-san, \Nthe producer at the time.
0.5;You're the one who ignored the opposition \Nand cast her in the lead role.
0.5;but because this work depicting \Nthe loss of a loved one
0.5;ruined a work that was \Nimportant to Yashiro-san.
0.5;why would she act on a \Nseven-year-old grudge now?
0.5;Yashiro-san probably hadn't \Nbeen holding a grudge.
0.5;But one month ago, Manda-san was \Nassigned to be the show's producer.
0.5;His superficial glibness and misappropriation \Nof programs had only increased!
0.5;and she decided to seek \Nrevenge on the couple.
0.5;She used a sedative at the \Nstaff drinking party last night
0.5;After that, she headed to \NManda Towako-san's place.
0.5;What do you want? It's \Nthe middle of the night.
0.5;You stole this from Mizutani-san's \Nhouse, didn't you?

0.5;As times change,\Ndifficult cases increase in number!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Why did he come to cheer\Nfor his bartender's son?
0.5;Besides, there's no point\Nwith such a one-sided game...
0.5;Plus his dad's a doctor and\Nhe's the school's best student!
0.5;Say, didn't Shuko win the\Ndistrict championship last year?
0.5;The current headmaster\Nfounded it way back when
0.5;But its image suddenly changed\Nwhen Kaji-kun showed up!
0.5;The championship flag\Nwas shredded up?!
0.5;Totally thrashed!\NEveryone was in a panic!
0.5;we've had all sorts\Nof jealousy-related trouble.
0.5;If this was similarly\Ndone by an outsider,
0.5;then we're victims, and we\Ncan save our school's reputation.
0.5;But we were still responsible\Nfor the flag's safe-keeping.
0.5;We have no choice but\Nto drop out of the tournament.
0.5;Wow! It's like the\Nbest seat in the house!
0.5;Hey, you! This is\Nauthorized personnel only!
0.5;But they still have to\Ndrop out of the tournament.
0.5;Hey, Mister. Where\Nis that ladder usually at?
0.5;The storeroom. I have\Nno idea when it was taken.
0.5;Actually, the key has\Nbeen missing all morning.
0.5;Yes, they disappeared\Nthis morning.
0.5;The culprit used the\Nkey to enter this office.
0.5;like someone\Nsnuck in from outside.
0.5;Yes. There's broken\Nglass near the window.
0.5;glass shards would\Nhave lodged in the shoes.
0.5;The culprit set the ladder up\Nbut didn't enter through the window.
0.5;I guess it might be natural\Nfor any good principal, but...
0.5;It would seem this\Nhappened during the game.
0.5;I saw Eto-kun\Nenter the school building...
0.5;I did come inside,\Nbut I went to the bathroom!
0.5;That's right!\NHe went to the nurse's office!
0.5;I was scared to\Nbe in the tournament.
0.5;But he lost his cool\Nonly after the 7th-inning balk.
0.5;Would he really shred up\Nthe flag and create a ruse?
0.5;Apparently, they need to\Nconsult the ailing headmaster.
0.5;Yes, Kaji definitely saw\Nsomeone in the office then.
0.5;That's why he pitched\Npoorly and was relieved.
0.5;Then he went to the nurse's\Noffice and the headmaster's office.
0.5;Hey, Conan-kun!\NWhat're you looking at?
0.5;I don't think we\Nshould be doing this...
0.5;A friend that goes here\Ntold me that even though
0.5;Kaji-kun was likely to\Nhelp them win again this year,
0.5;"He insists that\Nthey're unnecessary;"
0.5;all he wants is to create\Nnotable people like himself.
0.5;He was actually\Nsupposed to come today.
0.5;He was going to announce\Nthe team's withdrawal
0.5;from the tournament,\Nbut with his health failing...
0.5;Is it really okay\Nto do this at a school?
0.5;Would everyone please\Ncome to the headmaster's office?
0.5;I'm about to reveal\Nthe truth behind this incident.
0.5;the real culprit\Nhasn't been caught yet.
0.5;As you can see,\Nthe cuts on the front
0.5;Ran. Pretend to cut\Nit as if you were the culprit.
0.5;Yes. It's hard because\Nyou're right-handed.
0.5;Ran. Do it as if\Nyou were left-handed.
0.5;Don't be stupid!\NYes, I am a southpaw, but!
0.5;for the team to play\Nif you couldn't pitch for it.
0.5;Had the 180 cm\NKaji-kun or Eto-kun cut it,
0.5;But the real culprit\Ncouldn't reach the top.
0.5;In other words, the culprit is\Nunder 160 cm in height.
0.5;You wanted to talk\Nto the headmaster today.
0.5;I wanted Kenya to be a\Ndoctor like my late husband.
0.5;I was going to ask the\Nheadmaster to take the team
0.5;Unaware that he\Nwas going to do so anyway...
0.5;But then Kaji-kun\Ncame in after he saw
0.5;The culprit accidentally\Ndropped the cutter,
0.5;Certain that his\Nmother had cut the flag,
0.5;you two wound up\Ncovering for each other.
0.5;A left-handed person\Nless than 160 cm tall!
0.5;You waited for your\Nchance to sneak in here
0.5;before the headmaster\Nwas supposed to come.
0.5;You snuck off after\Ngiving the impression
0.5;made it look like someone\Nbroke in from outside,
0.5;The key to this office\Nshould be in your pocket.
0.5;You intended to lock\Nthe door and return the key
0.5;but you couldn't with\Neveryone coming and going.
0.5;which means it's only\Nnatural to think the culprit
0.5;We just got a call--\Nthe headmaster is dead!
0.5;to keep the team from\Nentering the tournament.
0.5;But it wasn't so easy\Nwith the media watching!
0.5;People would condemn\Nus for dropping out
0.5;"""What kind of school\Nwould crush kids' dreams?!"""
0.5;So to drop out and\Nprotect the school's name, I--
0.5;you crushed kids' dreams\Nwith your own two hands!
0.5;The tournament began\Nhalf a month later,
0.5;Kaji's pitching brings\Nthem closer and closer
0.5;Hey, let someone else \Nhave a turn with the mic.
0.5;He beautifully dances his \Nmystery-solving steps!
0.5;A star-crossed fate descends upon a \Nthief that becomes entangled with Genta.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;We should find the robber \Nfirst before he gets away.
0.5;Let's start by splitting \Nup and canvassing the area.
0.5;"""Violent man in a red jacket"" \Nis an inconvenient name."
0.5;"After all, ""The Nameless Gonbei"" \Nis a term for an unknown man."
0.5;"Why don't we call him ""Gonta"" since \Nhe's the Gonbei who pushed Genta?"
0.5;Impressive, Haibara-san. \NThat's a fantastic name.
0.5;Since he's the Gonbei who \Npushed Genta, he's Gonta.
0.5;That sounds like something \Nthe professor would say.
0.5;"""I didn't do it! He must've changed \Nmy clothes while I was unconscious!"""
0.5;He's a robber who broke into the \Nhome of Koda-san who lives up there.
0.5;He probably pushed Genta out of \Nthe way while he was fleeing.
0.5;So I thought I'd catch him and \Nturn him in to the police.
0.5;If we search randomly, \Nwe'll never get anywhere.
0.5;We might find something if we \Ngo to the house that was robbed.
0.5;The cop said Gonta seems to \Nbe suffering from amnesia.
0.5;We may be able to solve that mystery \Nif we go to the crime scene.
0.5;he was stealing my space \Nmuseum souvenir coin.
0.5;The crime scene shows signs \Nthat two men entered.
0.5;Rumor is he sends bad men after people \Nwho can't pay off their debts.
0.5;After knocking the woman \Nunconscious, he fled the house.
0.5;Gonta failed to make this \Nturn and accidentally fell.
0.5;The person who got involved would \Nnaturally report it to the police.
0.5;That's it! He doesn't know what happened \Nto him because he lost his memory.
0.5;It wasn't the bystander who got \Ninvolved who lost his memory.
0.5;Come to think of it, I thought \Nsomething seemed strange.
0.5;Are you sure the man who \Npushed you was that Gonta?
0.5;They switched places after falling \Nhere by changing clothes.
0.5;In other words, the Gonta \Nwe've been chasing...
0.5;then it explains why he \Nappeared at the crime scene.
0.5;If we question him, we'll be \Nable to find the real culprit.
0.5;This man is an innocent bystander \Nwho got caught up in the robbery.
0.5;I'd like to talk to you about \Nthe robbery in Oku-Beika.
0.5;If you're having trouble finding \Nthe money, go make some there.
0.5;It'll be easy. She's an \Nold woman living alone.
0.5;I thought it sounded good, \Nso I broke into this house.
0.5;But the old woman was unconscious, and \Nthe whole house had been searched.
0.5;I thought I'd gotten away \Nwith it by framing him.
0.5;So I was knocked unconscious \Nby two different robbers?
0.5;They weren't working together, \Nbut two men did indeed break in.
0.5;I committed one crime after \Nanother while trying to get away?
0.5;Torimaru-san, was this the voice you \Nheard at Ujihara Finance yesterday?
0.5;He broke into the house with the intention of \Nrobbing it and knocked Koda-san unconscious.
0.5;He was searching the house \Nwhen you broke in, and ran.
0.5;While he was nursing the ankle he twisted \Nwhile running, you ran into him.
0.5;All that's left is to arrest \NUjihara Masuzo for incitement.
0.5;Gonta-san must've felt like he \Nhad to after being threatened.
0.5;I was in despair after the company \NI was working at shut down.
0.5;Come to think of it, why were you \Nwalking around here, Genta-kun?
0.5;Yeah, we haven't heard the \Nanswer to that question yet.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The Blind \NSpot in the Changing Room, Part One!"""
0.5;Next episode features high \Nschool girls in swimsuits.
0.5;Maybe there will be some really \Nbig case, like in a drama.
0.5;Besides, we'd never get the chance \Nto participate in a case that big.
0.5;We still have lots to do once \Nwe get back to the station.
0.5;Inscribing love and cases \Nwith deductive reasoning!
0.5;The mini-patrol car is \Ndriven by an energetic duo.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;You came to the department store to \Ngo shopping at the food festival,
0.5;Th-That reminds me of \Nthose historical dramas.
0.5;No one's escaped from my mini-patrol \Ncar on these streets before!
0.5;It's the sound of Genta-kun's \Nstomach growling.
0.5;He's probably responding with his \Nstomach's growls because he can't speak.
0.5;He overheard us talking, \Nand he's seen our faces.
0.5;Damn. We're supposed to clean \Nup on diamonds today, too.
0.5;Did he just say they're \Ncleaning up on diamonds?
0.5;They kidnapped Genta-kun because he \Noverheard them plotting to steal diamonds.
0.5;Genta's car is heading towards \NTeitan Elementary School.
0.5;All right. We'll cut them \Noff and arrest them!
0.5;Hey, you're right.\NIt's Teitan Elementary School.
0.5;That mini-patrol car isn't \Ncoming after us, is it?
0.5;Yeah. I thought we were \Ngoing to eat some good food.
0.5;We need to save him soon. \NOtherwise Genta-kun...
0.5;They were an unusual color, \Nso I remember them well.
0.5;They were using hand signals \Nto communicate with each other.
0.5;No, they were probably \Ncommunicating the location
0.5;Then if we figure out \Nwhat these signals mean,
0.5;And before we lost sight of them, their \Ncar was heading towards the harbor.
0.5;in Japan we start with the index \Nfinger and raise one at a time...
0.5;That's exactly what a certain someone \Ninfluenced by his Gallicized mother does.
0.5;"In other words, those signs \Nmeant ""two"" and ""one."""
0.5;Combine that with the fact that the car \Nis heading towards the harbor, and...
0.5;That's it. The number 21 in the \Ndirection of the harbor means...
0.5;They're heading towards \Nwarehouse 21 at the harbor.
0.5;Their thinking's not wrong, \Nbut there's still something...
0.5;Come to think of it, at \Nthe department store...
0.5;They're the secret hand \Nsignals used at auctions.
0.5;Those signals used to \Nindicate prices at auctions?
0.5;When the man they were \Nsignaling walked past me,
0.5;And this is a punch that's \Nused for butchering eels.
0.5;Eel vendors would know the secret \Nhand signals of auctions.
0.5;The hand signals differ \Nslightly between markets,
0.5;but in Tokyo, one through five are \Nexpressed normally with your fingers.
0.5;Haven't you ever seen one of \Nthese in a police drama before?
0.5;that smuggles protected whitebait eels \Nthat are illegal to export overseas.
0.5;But didn't they say they'd \Nclean up on diamonds?
0.5;The number of whitebait eels \Nhas declined sharply recently.
0.5;The diamonds they were talking \Nabout were whitebait eels.
0.5;And this only happened \Nbecause I got kidnapped?
0.5;I'm just glad things turned \Nout okay this time.
0.5;The professor said he'll treat us to eel since \Nwe didn't buy anything at the food festival.
0.5;Are the eels gone because \Nyou ate too many of them?
0.5;"Some old men can't resist \N""deelivering"" stupid jokes."
0.5;Now why don't we manyou over and \Npartake of this repast as well?
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The High \NSchool Girl Trio's Secret Café, Part One!"""
0.5;An unexpected development \Nleads to the answer!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Could she have gone to \Nvisit family or friends?
0.5;That's because Mizunuma Kaho-san \Njumped from the bridge at 5:15 AM,
0.5;As far as I can tell from that \Nvideo, it was definitely a suicide.
0.5;P-Please. It's just a coincidence \Nthat it came out well.
0.5;Come to think of it, this place is pretty \Nfar from Kaho-san's house, right?
0.5;The trains and buses would've \Njust started running by then.
0.5;Her shoes are too clean for someone \Nwalking outside after it stopped raining.
0.5;Could you tell us what happened \Nwhen you gave her a ride?
0.5;I picked her up on the road and \Ndrove for about thirty minutes.
0.5;It's what we confirmed on \Nthe security camera footage.
0.5;She got off here looking \Nlike she was going to die.
0.5;Come to think of it, Kaho-san was carrying \Na handbag in the security camera footage.
0.5;What was she doing for over two \Nhours until she jumped after five?
0.5;Hey, as long as she's here, \Nlet's take a taxi home.
0.5;How long are you going to keep \Nwatching that? It's my phone.
0.5;Really? She kind of looks like \Nthe girl who killed herself.
0.5;A female college student fell down \Nsome stairs at a park and died.
0.5;Isn't the park where this \Nhappened near Kaho-san's house?
0.5;Jeez. This only happened \Nbecause you were wandering—
0.5;Even though you couldn't \Nsee her face clearly,
0.5;you all knew the person \Nin the video was Kaho-san.
0.5;If the person in the video \Nreally was Kaho-san.
0.5;Yes, that was a different \Nperson disguised as Kaho-san.
0.5;Right? You have a similar build as \Nher, and you're good at swimming...
0.5;You knew that Ushio-san would \Npass by the bridge at that time.
0.5;You said someone must've \Nretied them, remember?
0.5;In Ushio-san's video, \Nthere's something flashing.
0.5;I-It wasn't me! I'm sure that \NKaho girl wore a necklace, too!
0.5;Even when she wore a dress, \Nshe didn't even wear a watch.
0.5;I'm drowning in debt from my \Ndead daughter's medical bills.
0.5;When I saw her credit card, \NI couldn't help myself.
0.5;A keepsake of the daughter \Nwho lost her hair to illness.
0.5;I never thought I'd be \Nable to use it like this.
0.5;Why did Kaho-san come to \Nthis place late at night?
0.5;Kaho-san, a woman allergic to \Nmetals, wanted to buy a ring?
0.5;You're afraid your tattoo \Nsleeves will be seen.
0.5;I'm glad I had Conan drag you around \Nuntil you gave yourself away.
0.5;You're the man who pushed the student down \Nthe stairs at the park three months ago.
0.5;The curtains in Kaho-san's \Napartment were closed,
0.5;It's because she'd been unable to \Napproach the window for a long time.
0.5;Your driver's license had no \Nmention of corrective lenses
0.5;that's required for persons \Nwith impaired vision.
0.5;If you have such good vision, \Nwhy did you purchase—
0.5;Rather, for whom did you \Npurchase contact solution
0.5;You simply faked Kaho-san's death \Nto protect her from Naruse-san.
0.5;So much time had passed, and it \Nhad been treated as an accident.
0.5;For Maki-san, who risked \Nherself to protect me.
0.5;He's right. You tried to take \Nthe blame for killing Kaho-san.
0.5;Do you remember when you \Ntold me about what happened?
0.5;You thoughtlessly said you wanted \Nto die over something so small.
0.5;I thought about killing \Nyou, just like you wanted.
0.5;Conan-kun, do you think you can become \Nfamily even if you're not related by blood?
0.5;And it was the beginning of everything \Nthat happened in this case.
0.5;but I noticed this morning because \NI found this in my mailbox.
0.5;If you want it back, come and \Nget it in the underworld.
0.5;"If you notify the police, I'll dispose \Nof your treasure immediately."""
0.5;It's not expensive, but it's a keepsake from \Nmy mother who passed away the other day.
0.5;I'd like to settle this quietly, which is why \NI'm asking you for help rather than the police.
0.5;It's possible they're using this stolen treasure \Nas bait to lure her into her own murder.
0.5;The great Mori Kogoro has never \Naccepted a job and failed!
0.5;You really are as great \Na detective as they say.
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;The Sleeping Kogoro \Napproaches the underworld!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;This is actually my first \Ntime at Kuroochi Park.
0.5;We haven't found a sign of \Nyour treasure or the culprit.
0.5;The two of you can enjoy \Nthe road to hell together.
0.5;"If you want your treasure back, \Ncome to Dadagaya Concert Hall."""
0.5;They were probably watching from somewhere \Ninside the park to see if you'd bring the police.
0.5;While we were searching \Nevery inch of the park,
0.5;Then they stuffed it inside that clock \Nso it would be discovered and left.
0.5;Then the culprit was here \Nsomewhere in this park.
0.5;But they make it sound like they're fine \Ndealing with a detective and not the police.
0.5;Anyway, isn't this place a little \Nfar for a second location?
0.5;And it's on the complete opposite \Nside of the city, on the west end!
0.5;I'm sorry for making you travel \Nfrom one end of Tokyo to the other.
0.5;It's midday on a weekday! \NWhat are these people doing?
0.5;You're the great detective \NMori Kogoro, aren't you?
0.5;We have to look after our cows, \Nso we couldn't go on a honeymoon.
0.5;But we finally made time to \Ncome to Tokyo for two days.
0.5;Hebunzaka Church is on the \Noutskirts of Tokyo, isn't it?
0.5;The culprit is definitely trying \Nto kill this woman, but...
0.5;Once you finish eating that, \Nyou're heading straight home.
0.5;Have you figured out what the places \Nyou've been visiting have in common?
0.5;I have been to the area \Naround Kuroochi Park once.
0.5;who kept making suspicious \Nremarks met a mysterious end.
0.5;Believing it was murder, I saw through the \Nculprit's scheme and tracked them down.
0.5;who managed an art book publishing \Ncompany with his friend.
0.5;I brought him to the roof of the publishing \Ncompany and confronted him with my deduction.
0.5;Nagakura took his own life in \Nprison before his trial began.
0.5;It's possible he decided to commit suicide \Nwhen I revealed the truth on that rooftop.
0.5;It happened on the roof of the \Nbuilding across from Kuroochi Park.
0.5;I dropped it from the third \Nfloor, but it's not broken.
0.5;There must be some meaning behind the \Nlocations specified by the culprit.
0.5;then visited the concert hall, the art \Nmuseum, the seaside park, the church, and...
0.5;It's possible they want \Nus to notice something.
0.5;Kuroochi Park, Dadagaya Concert Hall, \NSutero Art Museum, Hadoson Seaside Park,
0.5;Each location has a special meaning \Nor memory associated with it,
0.5;I have a feeling the culprit is \Ndesperately asking you to do that.
0.5;I just happened to be hired. \NThere's no way for me to know.
0.5;Even though you're the \Ncountry's greatest detective?
0.5;I'm sorry, but I can't \Nknow what I don't know.
0.5;In any case, let's use these \Nclues to determine the location.
0.5;Omagari Intersection is way \Non the outskirts of Tokyo.
0.5;And if it's between there and \NShiraito Intersection, then...
0.5;So that's how it is! When \Nyou think of it that way...
0.5;It seems our next destination \Nis the finish line.
0.5;That person left these flowers \Nhere this morning and said that?
0.5;When I learned our next destination was \NOkagaoka Cemetery, I finally noticed.
0.5;It wasn't you who was being \Ndragged around, but me.
0.5;You lied about your treasured brooch \Nbeing stolen so you could bring me here.
0.5;but judging by that ring \Nyou have in your bag,
0.5;you were probably engaged \Nto Nagakura Ryoji-san.
0.5;You brought me to places full of \Nmemories, and finally, at his grave...
0.5;Don't you always sleep when you \Narrogantly lay out your reasoning?
0.5;but I wasn't asleep when \NI solved that case then.
0.5;I thought it would only be proper to assume \Nthis pose while explaining my reasoning.
0.5;"""Nagakura-san was a quiet man \Nwho loved music and art."""
0.5;And the first place you went \Ntogether was Sutero Art Museum.
0.5;You nurtured your love at beautiful \NHadoson Seaside Park,
0.5;But Nagakura-san's death turned \Nit into an impossible dream.
0.5;It all ended when he \Ncornered you on that roof.
0.5;You're wrong! It's because my \Nmother was alive until last week!
0.5;If I did that, my mother \Nwould have been sad—
0.5;You've waited until today because you \Nknew Nagakura-san wouldn't want—
0.5;The way you acknowledged \Nyour own powerlessness.
0.5;More importantly, she planned to \Nkill me and then kill herself!

0.5;They're probably construction workers \Nbuilding houses in the area.
0.5;It's hard to imagine a kidnapper \Ndressed in a sailor uniform.
0.5;That running woman is heading \Ntowards the fountain.
0.5;Edogawa-kun, what about the \Nman next to the swings?
0.5;He's clearly watching his surroundings \Nand acting suspiciously.
0.5;You're under arrest for the \Nkidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan!
0.5;The culprit's been arrested, \Nbut something not right.
0.5;That man is probably a \Ncommunications fraud con artist.
0.5;I thought it seemed strange for a \Nkidnapper to behave so apprehensively.
0.5;That man was probably shocked \Nto hear the charges.
0.5;Now that you mention it, he \Ndoesn't seem like a kidnapper.
0.5;I told you, I don't know \Nanything about a kidnapping.
0.5;The kidnapper probably hadn't come \Nto the hand-off location yet.
0.5;Then I'll observe the scene \Ncarefully and find the kidnapper.
0.5;It's time to demonstrate the \Nresults of our training.
0.5;I've chosen that man sitting \Non the bench to the left.
0.5;Why? Because he hasn't \Ndone anything in a while.
0.5;If he works in an office, he \Nwouldn't be hanging around a park.
0.5;I've chosen the large man \Nwearing a yukata in the field.
0.5;At first glance, it looks like he's \Nsearching for a four-leaf clover,
0.5;That man wearing a hat who's been doing \Nexercises by the horizontal bars.
0.5;Since he's been doing warm-ups for so long, \Nhe must intend to do something after this.
0.5;it must mean that it's nearly the \Ntime scheduled by the kidnapper.
0.5;What? He's in the middle \Nof arresting the kidnapper!
0.5;The kidnapper isn't that \Nman. There's someone else.
0.5;and the man who came to get the \Nransom money were probably just hired.
0.5;Since time is short, I'll \Nstart from the conclusion.
0.5;The culprit is the man \Nwearing the gray jacket.
0.5;While that was going on, he had another \Nman attempt to seize the ransom money.
0.5;The kidnapper himself isn't going to receive \Nthe money because he's cautious of the police.
0.5;But how did you figure out that the man \Nin the gray jacket is the kidnapper?
0.5;Normally, when a person falls in a river, \Neveryone looks that way out of surprise.
0.5;But the man in the gray jacket \Nwasn't surprised at all.
0.5;He's surely mad at the victim \Nfor breaking their promise.
0.5;If you don't arrest him here, the kidnapping \Nvictim's life could be in danger.
0.5;He's not here. The man in \Nthe gray jacket is gone!
0.5;I can't believe I lost him \Nin the second I looked away.
0.5;Remember. Did he have any \Nother distinctive qualities?
0.5;Those are nice sneakers. \NAre they limited edition?
0.5;Could I ask you a few questions about \Nthe kidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan?
0.5;Kidnapping victim Shibata Mika-chan was \Ndiscovered safe in the kidnapper's home.
0.5;And the communications fraud \Ncase was resolved, too.
0.5;Why not learn from the \Nexperience for next time?
0.5;You're right. After all, \Nthat's why we're training.
0.5;Sensei, if you don't leave \Nsoon, you'll be late.
0.5;The victim is the owner of the home, \NBaba Sadako-san, 62 years old.
0.5;This is Sadako-san's \Nsecretary Ogu Masaya-san.
0.5;We're waiting on the autopsy for details, \Nbut it seems she was killed last night.
0.5;Then the detective Mori \NKogoro might know something.
0.5;This is Barbara Sadako's \Nfortune telling shop.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""The Fortune Teller and \Nthe Three Customers!"""
0.5;It's possible the secretary did \Nit and he's trying to frame me.
0.5;to invite Sadako-san out \Nto the scene of the murder.
0.5;After being killed somewhere else, \Nshe was transported to this house.
0.5;But if someone used your name, wouldn't \Nyou be determined to find the culprit?
0.5;I don't understand what \Nthis culprit is doing.
0.5;After appearing on a live TV \Nbroadcast about a week ago...
0.5;then it must have been Kanawa Shinsuke, \NEndo Fukami, or Sazanami Ryoichi.
0.5;But to be sure, check to see if there \Nwas anyone else who hated the victim.
0.5;So they accidentally dropped it when \Nthey transported the body here.
0.5;If that's true, then they're \Nunbelievably careless.
0.5;They saw a suspicious figure \Npacking something large
0.5;I found signs of a struggle \Nand those objects.
0.5;drove her to that mansion, \Nand left the body there.
0.5;I was curious, so I looked \Nup the license plate number.
0.5;I learned it had already \Nbeen reported stolen.
0.5;While these three are suspicious, \Nthe culprit isn't one of them.
0.5;Then they loaded the body \Ninto the car of the trunk
0.5;and transported it to the \Nstudy in Sadako-san's mansion.
0.5;That's when Fukami-san dropped her brooch \Nand left without realizing she'd lost it.
0.5;Inspector, these three are the \Nonly ones who hated the victim.
0.5;Sazanami-san, your car was \Nused to transport the body.
0.5;I was thinking of buying a house, so \NI had her tell me my lucky direction.
0.5;the construction company I was working \Nfor shut down, and my wife left me.
0.5;The man right before your eyes \Nis the love of your life.
0.5;But when I trusted her and \Nmarried him, he swindled me.
0.5;But when I rushed to quit my job and open \Nshop, it failed, and now I'm drowning in debt.
0.5;And none of you have alibis \Nfor last night, right?
0.5;You expect us to believe \Nyour convenient story?
0.5;show the victim died between \N8PM and 9PM last night.
0.5;The culprit wrote it when \Nthey brought the body here
0.5;If one of them killed her, \Nthey'd never write this.
0.5;the culprit must've known \Nthey hated the victim.
0.5;I wouldn't embarrass myself \Nby telling anyone that.
0.5;It's hard to imagine them telling someone \Nabout it on purpose, which means...
0.5;If we examine the crime scene, I'm sure \Nwe'll find a clue to the culprit's identity.
0.5;let's take a break before \Ndiscussing the case further.
0.5;No one besides those three \Nhated the victim, right?
0.5;Yeah. No matter how hard I looked, \NI couldn't find anyone else.
0.5;In other words, one of \Nthem is still the culprit.
0.5;Why did the culprit make us \Nsuspect all three of them?
0.5;The secretary wouldn't have told \Nanyone they hated the victim.
0.5;If they can't find the real culprit, \Nwhat's going to happen to this case?
0.5;When you think of it that way, it explains \Nwhy all three of them were framed.
0.5;Well, my company wasn't doing well \Nsince before I bought the house,
0.5;and my relationship with my wife \Nhad been going poorly for a while.
0.5;It's the restaurant I started \Nafter quitting my job.
0.5;"and throw pieces of star-shaped pork into \Nit while shouting, ""Shooting star!"""
0.5;As long as I opened at the right \Ntime, business would've been booming.
0.5;When you think of it that way, it explains \Nwhy they got the old man involved.
0.5;There's something I'd \Nlike to confirm with you.
0.5;Yes, could you please compare \Nit to the data I just sent you?
0.5;Everyone, Mori-kun just called \Nto say he's figured out the case.
0.5;By pretending they were \Nframed by the true culprit
0.5;In other words, there was never \Na true culprit who framed them?
0.5;These three are the only \Nones who hated the victim.
0.5;All three of you being accomplices \Nis just one possibility.
0.5;There's also another way \Nto interpret the situation.
0.5;The key to solving this case \Nis in the culprit's character.
0.5;even though it didn't \Nbenefit them in any way.
0.5;They deliberately left personal items \Nat the murder scene and body's location
0.5;because they needed Sazanami-san's \Ncar to move the body
0.5;so that along with the text document, \Nall three of them would be suspects.
0.5;There was that, of course, but the culprit's \Ncharacter required them to do it.
0.5;If you look at their motive, it was clear \Nthey'd eventually fall under suspicion.
0.5;Rather than fearing when the police \Nwould arrive at their door,
0.5;they thought it'd be better \Nto be identified right away.
0.5;So weak they relied on a fortune \Nteller to make life decisions.
0.5;Because the culprit was weak, \Nthey felt uneasy doing it alone.
0.5;They wanted others beside them \Nwho were in the same situation:
0.5;same motive, no alibi, and personal \Nitems left at the crime scene.
0.5;They also used my name and got me \Ninvolved because of their weakness.
0.5;the police would be forced \Nto ask for my help.
0.5;Rather than anxiously waiting to see when \Nthe great detective would turn up...
0.5;It'd be better for you to \Nbe involved from the start?
0.5;And if I, a man trusted by the police, \Ndeduced that the three of them
0.5;were framed by the true culprit, \Nthere would be no greater assurance.
0.5;There's no guarantee that you'd \Ncome to the desired conclusion.
0.5;One of these three is \Nsimultaneously weak-willed
0.5;Yesterday you called the \Nvictim, inviting them out.
0.5;I have something to discuss \Nwith Barbara Sadako-sensei.
0.5;Then you called Kanawa-san and Endo-san \Nso they wouldn't have alibis.
0.5;Sadako-sensei will be visiting you tonight \Nto apologize for her fortune telling.
0.5;You left Kanawa-san's lighter \Nat the scene of the murder,
0.5;which you likely stole when \Nyou went to make a complaint.
0.5;You used your allegedly stolen car to \Ntransport the body to the Baba mansion
0.5;and left Endo-san's brooch, which \Nyou also stole, by the body.
0.5;You also left the text document \Nthat would be discovered
0.5;After making that claim, you waited for \Nthe time of death to be determined.
0.5;If one of them killed her, \Nthey'd never write this.
0.5;You escaped into that blind \Nspot and tried to get away
0.5;while the police searched for a \Ntrue culprit who didn't exist.
0.5;Now I'm the killer just \Nbecause of my character?
0.5;Then how did you know the \Nmurder was committed here?
0.5;I saw a suspicious figure in \NShibahama Park last night.
0.5;You told us the scene of the murder, \Nwhich only the culprit could've known.
0.5;Only once we discovered Kanawa-san's \Nlighter left at the scene of the murder
0.5;If she'd properly told me my \Nfortune, it would've succeeded!
0.5;There's no way Alien Ramen \Nwouldn't draw customers!
0.5;As times change, difficult\Ncases increase in number!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,

0.5;So, then there\Nreally is treasure?!
0.5;We'll just have\Nto find out, won't we?
0.5;Where did you get\Nthat phony map anyway?
0.5;You'll find out for yourself\Nwhen you get to the end!
0.5;First, you need to make\Nyour way to London Bridge!
0.5;Well, I'm going to do\Nsome fishing here,
0.5;We still don't know\Nif there really is treasure--
0.5;Yeah! Diamonds, or jewels,\Nor maybe even buried gold!
0.5;since it's called\Nthe London Bridge!
0.5;Yeah, bridges like this\Nalways break in the movies!
0.5;What was the Professor thinking,\Nsending us out here?!
0.5;My compass doesn't\Nseem to work out here...
0.5;Why'd he hafta hide the\Ntreasure in these mountains?!
0.5;Gimme a break! The map says there's\Nfive cedar trees but there's only four here!
0.5;he died in an accident\Njust after burying the treasure!
0.5;You wouldn't want\Nto start a forest fire.
0.5;They have a shovel,\Nbut they're wearing suits!
0.5;It's hard to tell because\Nit was chopped down.

0.5;so that narrows it\Ndown to the two on the left.

0.5;so we take the narrowest\Npath on the very left!
0.5;"So the ""Devil's Hand""\Nis your left hand?"
0.5;They're definitely looking\Nfor the same treasure as us!
0.5;Not even the best camping\Nmatches will light when they get wet...
0.5;Darn it. I was hoping\Nwe could dry our clothes off...
0.5;I take the top\Noff the flashlight,
0.5;remove the reflector,\Nand put a match in it.
0.5;It may be a good camping match,\Nbut it's still dripping wet...
0.5;Are you sure\Nit's even usable now?
0.5;Can't you at least\Ncall it survival knowledge?
0.5;Looks like something's\Nwritten on it...
0.5;Maybe it was too dangerous\Nfor them to go alone...
0.5;Do you think we can really\Nmake it to the end?
0.5;I don't wanna\Nclimb up that again!
0.5;We're right here,\Nso if we go around like this
0.5;we'll make it to\Nour next destination.

0.5;Hey, Conan!\NThere's nothing here!
0.5;It's the Big Dipper,\Nmade out of logs and stones!
0.5;"It's shaped like a ladle,\Nhence the ""sky water""!"

0.5;In other words,\Nthe sky water and the stones

0.5;And it's also located off\Nof Cassiopeia's central star,

0.5;burned Ayako-san\Nto death in the garage,
0.5;Damn it! Why would\Nthe owner want to kill me?!
0.5;I even helped him\Nwith the book he published!
0.5;A Holmes book he published\Nlast year with his own money.
0.5;"I believe the title was\N""The Disparagement of Irene Adler."""
0.5;Alright, Ran!\NWe're going after the owner!
0.5;Forget about it.\NThere's no point.
0.5;You'd never find the\Nkiller by looking out there!
0.5;See how it's unnaturally\Nplaced at the narrow end?
0.5;It's proof that the\Nkiller quickly pushed it under
0.5;He's right! There are\Npieces of glass stuck in it!
0.5;But that only proves\Nthe killer used the chair to--
0.5;You idiot! Who would\Nbother putting a chair back
0.5;after smashing a\Nwindow to escape through it?
0.5;The killer probably\Nheld the chair with bare hands
0.5;It was too dark to\Nremove the fingerprints,
0.5;so the killer put the\Nchair back under the table--
0.5;so we wouldn't notice and so\Nthey could wipe the fingerprints off
0.5;Wait, we were the\Nonly ones in the room then...
0.5;Now do you see\Nthat the owner didn't do it,
0.5;and that the killer\Nis in this very room?!
0.5;Yes! When I tried to\Nplug in the coffee maker,
0.5;There was a thin wire\Nwrapped around the plug
0.5;But where did\Nthe killer get this wire?
0.5;The wire attached to\Nthe top of this coffee pack!
0.5;The width and length\Ndo match perfectly...
0.5;All three of those people\Nhave alibis for the first incident!
0.5;You most likely took a wire off\Na pack when no one was looking,
0.5;wrapped it around the plug,\Nand then returned to the living room
0.5;you attacked Fujisawa-san\Nwith an ice pick
0.5;that you carried in\Nhere with some ice--
0.5;using the flame from\Nhis lighter to find him!
0.5;However, some unexpected\Nobstacles caused you to fail.
0.5;in that the culprit plainly\Nleft evidence behind.
0.5;Perhaps this third incident\Nwasn't part of the killer's plan?
0.5;But I'm just a kid,\Nso what would I know?
0.5;There's something really\Nstrange about this kid!
0.5;He isn't playing detective!\NHe's really analyzing!
0.5;His voice and body are different,\Nbut he's almost just like Kudo!
0.5;And then when Kudo disappeared,\Nhe just popped up again...
0.5;how did he set the garage on\Nfire during the second incident?
0.5;the owner's car sped up\Nbefore it went over the cliff!
0.5;I've got almost all of\Nthe second incident solved,
0.5;but the first incident\Nmakes no sense...
0.5;Eh? You know how they set\Nthe garage on fire?!
0.5;Why we didn't see the\Nowner for almost an entire day...
0.5;The odd sound coming\Nfrom inside the car
0.5;And then one more mystery\Nappeared when we came here.
0.5;The owner was holding\Nthe steering wheel tightly.
0.5;The car was on a bumpy road,\Nbut his body never slumped.
0.5;That means by the time\Nhe was placed in the car,
0.5;A body usually begins to stiffen\Nthirty minutes to two hours after death,
0.5;and nine to twelve hours later,\Nthe body becomes completely stiff.
0.5;the body loosens up again and\Napproximately seventy hours later
0.5;If we assume the\Nowner was completely stiff
0.5;when he was placed\Nin the car at 3:30 a.m.,
0.5;then he was killed between\N3:30 and 5:30 p.m. the previous day.
0.5;is why they had to\Nput him in the car so early...
0.5;Maybe to make\Nit look like a suicide?
0.5;My guess is that they\Nkilled the owner before dinner,
0.5;put him in the car, had him\Nsit with his hands on the wheel,
0.5;waited for him to stiffen,\Nthen went to the garage after dinner
0.5;the killer was one of\Nyou who left after dinner!
0.5;A dead person couldn't\Npossibly have done that...
0.5;If so, then only that\Nperson could've done it,
0.5;If she had actually seen\Nsomething in that person's room...
0.5;You must have used hypnosis\Nto make the owner drive the car!
0.5;I can't wait to use\Na sleeping dart on him...
0.5;But it's all over if he catches\Nme during my explanation.
0.5;If so, then you\Nknow who did it, huh?
0.5;I haven't the slightest idea.\NI'm pretty dumb, you see.
0.5;He knows all right, he's just\Ntrying to make me explain it!
0.5;I'll just be going\Nto the bathroom now...
0.5;I just figured out\Nwho the killer is, too!
0.5;The person behind all three\Nincidents at this lodge... was you!
0.5;The person behind all\Nthree incidents at this lodge...
0.5;I was here in the living room\Nhours before the car even took off!
0.5;And when Ayako was killed,\NI was with everyone else!
0.5;Don't you mock me with\Nyour fancy Kansai dialect!
0.5;And besides, you were with us\Ntoo when the car started moving!
0.5;How could Togano-san\Npossibly have started the car?!
0.5;You're right, it certainly\Nappears impossible.
0.5;But if he were to\Nutilize the rigor mortis
0.5;The culprit killed the owner\Nalmost exactly one day ago,
0.5;sat him in the car seat,\Nand stuck his foot on the brake.
0.5;Rigor mortis would\Noccur half a day later,
0.5;even if the engine\Nwas running and in drive.
0.5;Before dinner last night,\Nthe killer opened the garage
0.5;and then waited in the living room\Nfor the foot on the brake to loosen up
0.5;and cause the\Ncar to start moving...
0.5;What if the outside\Ntemperature increases?
0.5;If the temperature around the body\Nwas about 95 degrees Fahrenheit,
0.5;the rigor mortis and rate of\Nloosening up would speed up,
0.5;so it would start to go away after\Nonly twenty-four to thirty hours.
0.5;It was after 10:00 p.m. two nights\Nago that the owner disappeared.
0.5;If he had been\Nkilled shortly afterward...
0.5;The car started moving approximately\Ntwenty-nine hours later
0.5;which was just\Nabout the right time.
0.5;The hissing sound\Nwe heard inside the car
0.5;wasn't the air conditioner--\Nit was the heater!
0.5;water drops would have\Nfallen by the front tires.
0.5;So that's why you were\Nchecking around the tire tracks?
0.5;But that trick would\Nbe easy to see through
0.5;so we couldn't check\Nthe state of rigor mortis!
0.5;That was probably because his\Nfoot slipped off the brake pedal
0.5;was there to conceal\Nthe heater indicator
0.5;from people\Nwho got near the car!
0.5;So by witnessing the car\Nwith someone else in the room...
0.5;...they would\Nhave an airtight alibi!
0.5;So the reason Togano-san kept\NAyako-san in the living room
0.5;was because he wanted someone\Nwho would witness the car with him?
0.5;And the only person who\Ncould have done such a thing
0.5;Your theory almost sounds\Nlike it's straight out of a novel.
0.5;It's too bad you have\Nno evidence to prove it.
0.5;And as I've said before,\Nwhen the fire erupted in the garage,
0.5;No matter how you look at it,\Nthere's no way
0.5;I could have set the fire exactly\Nwhen Ayako happened to go in there.
0.5;No, but it would\Nstill be easy enough...
0.5;that the first-edition Holmes book\Nwas hidden beneath the back seat
0.5;The first-edition book?\NWhat's that have to do with anything?
0.5;At that time, the car in the\Ngarage was drained of its gasoline
0.5;She wanted to look for the book,\Nbut with the car lights unusable
0.5;the back seat would\Nhave been pitch black.
0.5;If it were pitch dark, I'd have\Nto use a lighter or something...
0.5;The flame ignited the gasoline\Nthat had leaked from the car!
0.5;So she was the\None who started the fire?!
0.5;But she was an important\Nwitness from the first incident!
0.5;There were four\Nother witnesses besides her!
0.5;There was no\Nneed to keep her alive...
0.5;But aren't Ayako-san\Nand Togano-san lovers?
0.5;Because she figured\Nout his rigor mortis trick
0.5;and found evidence that\Nhe was the one responsible!
0.5;Ayako-san declared\Nshe knew who the killer was.
0.5;Hearing that, \NTogano-san grew flustered
0.5;and pretended to\Nfollow her to the bathroom.
0.5;He then told her\Nabout the first-edition book
0.5;and lured her into\Nthe trap in the garage!
0.5;Togano-san was\Nthe only one alone with her...
0.5;So that's why she changed her\Nattitude after leaving the bathroom!
0.5;But he certainly was clever\Nto come up with that garage trick...
0.5;No. That trap had been prepared\Nin advance for a certain person...
0.5;The killer lucked out because\NAyako-san had a lighter,
0.5;just as that other\Nperson would have had!
0.5;Yes. The trap in the garage\Nwas really meant to kill Fujisawa-san!
0.5;That card that\Nwas stuck in your door...
0.5;The killer intended to lure\Nyou into the garage and murder you!
0.5;He quickly devised\Na plan to cause a blackout
0.5;I see. So that's why\Nthere was so much evidence
0.5;Togano-san was in\Nthe kitchen at the time--
0.5;he could've very\Neasily fiddled with it!
0.5;who could've pulled\Noff all three incidents...
0.5;If you're going to make such accusations,\Nthen surely you have proof?
0.5;Ayako-san saw a certain\Nsomething in your room
0.5;"""Which hand does\NHolmes write with?"""
0.5;"""What is the name\Nof Dr. Watson's wife?"""
0.5;Didn't you take the Holmes Cult\NTest of 1000 Questions too?

0.5;"There was only that one question\Nabout ""The Dancing Men""!"
0.5;"""Write down the entire 'Dancing\NMen' code as it appeared!"""
0.5;That question was so hard it\Nwould be impossible to forget.
0.5;Isn't it a little strange\Nthat you don't remember it?
0.5;The reason Ayako-san\Nwent to your room
0.5;to check the state of\Nthe owner's rigor mortis!
0.5;Yes. A completely blank test\Nwith no answers written at all!
0.5;The reason he\Ndidn't write anything down
0.5;was because\Nthere would be no point.
0.5;you knew that the owner\Nwouldn't be grading the tests
0.5;If you're going to claim\Nthis is all nonsense,
0.5;then would you kindly\Nshow us your test?
0.5;Speak up! Why did you\Nwant me and the owner dead?!
0.5;His motive was most likely\Nthe book you helped the owner write.
0.5;Irene? The actress who outwitted\NHolmes in one of the stories?
0.5;Yes. But the owner's\Nbook was mostly about
0.5;Togano-san felt that \Nthe book insulted Holmes, so he--
0.5;Irene was the only\Nwoman Sherlock admired.
0.5;I couldn't possibly see\Nsuch a woman ridiculing him.
0.5;Just what I'd expect from\Nthe great western detective!
0.5;A case like this is\Nlike a walk in the park for me!

0.5;We were actually going for the \Nassorted high-end sirloin cuts.
0.5;Ran would probably be jealous if she heard \Nabout it, so I guess I won't tell her.
0.5;You sent me a picture asking if I \Nrecognized that man with the scary face.
0.5;I did wonder why he knew \Nso much about me, though.
0.5;You find surprising elements to help \Nsolve cases and back up his reasoning.
0.5;That's what they said about you at\Nthe station, Edogawa Conan-kun.
0.5;But since he's part of the \NNagano Prefectural Police,

0.5;Hey, you're the girl who got her \Nblood sucked by the enemy monster!
0.5;We can take a picture together \Nafter I get you a new cake.

0.5;My agency was asked to look \Nafter her until she gets better.
0.5;But why are those two \Nstaying in the same hotel?
0.5;Because they're co-starring \Nin a romantic drama
0.5;set at this hotel that's \Nstarting this spring.
0.5;It got pretty good reviews, \Nso they're making a sequel.
0.5;Two women reveal their true selves \Nto try to bring each other down.
0.5;After you deliver that to her, \Ncould you come see me in room 504?
0.5;Come to think of it, she\Nmentioned something
0.5;but it's just her playing with a dog, \Nintroducing her favorite comics, and cooking.
0.5;I told you to get a super \Nfine bristled toothbrush.
0.5;Kyona-san won't answer the door no \Nmatter how many times I ring the bell.
0.5;I don't have any scenes today, but \NKyona-san starts shooting in thirty minutes.
0.5;You heard her! Unlock the door \Nimmediately using the master key!
0.5;I was asked to come wake \Nher at five in the evening,
0.5;but she wasn't answering the door no \Nmatter how many times I rang the bell.
0.5;and had the bellhop unlock the \Ndoor using the master key.
0.5;Th-That's when I found Kyona-san collapsed\Nin this bedroom and bleeding from the head.
0.5;I see. But, Sakurako-san, \Naren't you a housekeeper?
0.5;I can't believe this happened \Nat another one of my jobs...
0.5;who's at every crime scene you are,\Nseems far more cursed to me.
0.5;she was struck repeatedly on the \Nhead with a thin rod-shaped weapon.
0.5;Kyona-san said she wouldn't \Nopen the door for anyone else,
0.5;That sounds like a strange \Nway to make that request.
0.5;She was almost attacked by a stalker \Npretending to be one of the staff.
0.5;except for the person she \Ndesignated beforehand.
0.5;the actress who was supposed to appear\Nin the drama alongside Kyona-san.
0.5;The drama's set in this hotel, \Nso she's staying here, too.
0.5;I heard at the front desk that \NKyona-san wasn't answering the door.
0.5;In any case, we're going to \Ninvestigate the room more closely.
0.5;since you discovered the body, \Ncould you wait in Saya-san's room?
0.5;There's not going to be a \Ndrama, much less a film shoot!
0.5;The focus of today was Kyona-chan and \NSaya-chan's reunion at the hotel!
0.5;As though you knew today's filming \Nwould be canceled anyway.
0.5;The problem is the key card \Nthat was inside the room.
0.5;Key cards can be slipped under \Nthe door even after locking it.
0.5;But no matter how hard you did it, \Nit wouldn't reach a room in the back.
0.5;Could she have transported it \Nusing the toy helicopter? How?
0.5;when Kyona-san said she would only \Nopen the door for Sakurako-san?
0.5;It seems unlikely that she'd invite her \Nin since they were arguing earlier.
0.5;In any case, I still don't have enough \Npieces to assemble this puzzle.
0.5;The room is mostly laid \Nout the same way, too.
0.5;By the way, what was\Nthat thing on your door?
0.5;The drama was going to \Npromote this hotel as well,
0.5;so the hotel arranged for the two \Nleads to stay in these rooms.
0.5;Though since the drama is canceled, \NI'll probably have to leave tomorrow.
0.5;Kyona-san is in all the pictures on her \Nblog, but Saya-san's not in most of hers.
0.5;Unlike Kyona-san, I don't like to \Npromote myself through pictures.
0.5;It wasn't flying right, so \NI threw it away somewhere.
0.5;You'll get stuck again if \Nyou keep flying it inside.
0.5;But I know how she got in and \Nwhat she used for a weapon.
0.5;The murder victim seemed \Nmalicious, rude, and vulgar,
0.5;you'll see she had a surprisingly \Nsensitive and conscientious side, too.
0.5;Her nail polish bottles were \Narranged in numerical order.
0.5;They're even a brand that you have \Nto turn over to see the number.
0.5;The culprit locked the room without \Nusing it for its intended purpose.

0.5;It's what was written in the \Ne-mail I received from Kano-san.
0.5;The cause of death seems to be suffocation \Nresulting from pressure to the neck.
0.5;Based on postmortem \Nlividity and rigor mortis,
0.5;he likely died between one hour \Nto one and a half hours ago.
0.5;Based on the presence of Yoshikawa lines on \Nhis neck that appear when a victim struggles,
0.5;Kano-san was likely strangled \Nfrom behind by someone...
0.5;...who then wrapped a rope around his \Nneck and hanged him from the ceiling.
0.5;No. If you sat the body in a \Nchair placed on top of the desk,
0.5;There's an e-mail from Takeda-san \Non Kano-san's phone.
0.5;Since a woodpecker's footprint \Nwas left on Kano's forehead,
0.5;it's likely that his remaining three \Ntargets are members of the police force.
0.5;Let's show him what happens when \Nyou make enemies with cops.
0.5;What do you think of this rope \Nthat was around his neck?
0.5;I already touched him when \NI took him down. Does it matter?
0.5;there's a witness claiming \Nthey saw you near the bridge
0.5;You don't look like someone who'd \Nbe easily confused with another.
0.5;The same goes for you, \NSection One Chief Kuroda.
0.5;and the man who holed up \Ninside a bank six months ago.
0.5;Kano-san was in Takeda's squad both \Nnine years ago and six months ago.
0.5;But I thought most of the family members \Nof the culprits Takeda shot were dead,
0.5;and the only one left is \Nthe shooter's grandmother.
0.5;Yeah, but she could never\N cut off someone's head,
0.5;Nine years ago, his friend was \Nshot right in front of him.
0.5;And he objected to the \Nshooting six months ago.
0.5;Even parasites inside a \Nlion will eat their host.
0.5;You know that, don't you, \NInspector Morofushi?
0.5;You've known each other since \Nchildhood, and you're great friends.
0.5;Come to think of it, I heard Yamato was \Nyour mentor when you first became a cop.
0.5;You'd better not side with \Nhim just because of that.
0.5;Our squad chief may have been killed, \Nbut you're still a part of the Takeda Squad.
0.5;Kano came home because he \Nnoticed something, right?
0.5;I think the woodpecker's footprint \Non Chief Takeda's forehead
0.5;We let Section Chief Kuroda \Nknow about it, too.
0.5;with Kano-san's missed calls \Nthat he hadn't read it yet.
0.5;Wait, why do we have to \Ntalk to this kid, anyway?
0.5;Then Kansuke-kun could have known \Nthat Kano-san returned to his home.
0.5;That's right. There's no way Inspector \NYamato of all people would murder someone.
0.5;I got pretty wet from canvassing \Nin the rain. My house is nearby.
0.5;Come to think of it, his \Nmom lives around here.
0.5;Yes. I believe she runs \Nthe salon on the corner.
0.5;The god of war who will \Ndestroy the woodpecker.
0.5;The burned body under the bridge and \NInspector Takeda's head were a match?
0.5;Inspector Yamato decided to investigate \Non his own for various reasons.
0.5;Morofushi, I told you not to \Nlet him out of your sight.
0.5;Akiyama-kun went to his mother's home \Nto change out of his wet clothes.
0.5;Since he hasn't come back after some time, \NInspector Saegusa left to check on him.
0.5;After changing at home, he got in \Nhis car and headed for Mt. Saijo!
0.5;Yeah, the cottage where the \Nwanted robber was hiding out.
0.5;For some reason we've been getting \Na lot of flat tires lately.
0.5;The god of war who will \Ndestroy the woodpecker.
0.5;Before the car dragged him off \Nthe cliff, Akiyama-kun said...
0.5;After reading the message, Akiyama-kun \Nleft for his house so he could change.
0.5;Then he headed to Mt. Saijo from home \Ninstead of returning to the station.
0.5;"""I found the murdered Takeda's phone \Namong a certain person's possessions,"
0.5;"so make up an excuse to come to \Nthe cottage at Mt. Saijo."""
0.5;He's the one who brought \NAkiyama here and killed him?
0.5;No. On my way here, I tried calling him \Nnumerous times, but his phone seems to be off.
0.5;The culprit could have sent it \Npretending to be Inspector Yamato.
0.5;Sorry. He got into our car at some \Npoint, but this boy is actually—
0.5;You find surprising elements to help \Nsolve cases and back up his reasoning.
0.5;as he was looking for the phone, \Nand he was forced to leave.
0.5;It's possible that Akiyama \Ndid some quick thinking.
0.5;Akiyama did this so the \Nevidence wouldn't be erased.
0.5;Or else the suspect did \Nit to make us think that.
0.5;We'll put out a BOLO for \Nhim as a murder suspect!
0.5;Inspector Yamato touched the rope \Nto get Lieutenant Kano's body down.
0.5;They weren't just on the part of \Nthe rope wrapped around the light.
0.5;They were also found on the \Nrope wrapped around his neck.
0.5;No. I was standing by the \Nbody until forensics arrived,
0.5;near the bridge where \NTakeda's body was discovered
0.5;and that Yamato resented the \NTakeda Squad over the shooting
0.5;that happened nine years ago and \Nthe bank case six months ago,
0.5;But Inspector Yamato \Nwould never kill someone!
0.5;We should prioritize \Njustice over emotions right now.
0.5;If we let him get away \Nnow, we might regret it.
0.5;Don't go easy on him just \Nbecause you know him.
0.5;Think of him as a murderer who's \Nkilled three cops in a row.
0.5;The ground is muddy because \Nof the rain, and it's dark.
0.5;Morofushi's will be a bit tight \Nwith the spare tire in the back.
0.5;Is it true that Inspector Yamato \Ntook Lieutenant Kano's body down?
0.5;Kan-chan stood on a chair, and \NAkiyama-kun raised the body a little.
0.5;without considering the consequences \Nif he thinks he can save someone.
0.5;The other day? Did something \Nsimilar happen before?
0.5;The parents of the man who \Nholed up inside the bank
0.5;couldn't stand the abuse they were \Nreceiving from their neighbors,
0.5;When Kansuke-kun arrived at the scene, \Nhe got on a chair and took them down.
0.5;Unlike in Kano-san's case, he untied \Nthe knots attached to the beams.
0.5;How was the rope used to \Nhang Detective Kano tied?
0.5;Well, he was hanging from a rope \Nmade from two connected loops.
0.5;The upper loop was wrapped \Naround the light's bar.
0.5;Kansuke-kun grabbed the upper loop with \Nboth hands and removed it fro the lamp.
0.5;When the body was lowered to the floor, do \Nyou remember where everyone was standing?
0.5;The others were standing \Na short distance away.
0.5;Did anything happen then that \Nmight have distracted everybody?
0.5;a message from Takeda-san's phone \Nthought to be sent by the suspect
0.5;was sent to Kano-san's phone, \Nwhich was in the body's coat pocket.
0.5;"""I am the god of war who will destroy the \Nwoodpecker,"" that Kansuke-kun received earlier..."
0.5;That means excluding the \Nmurdered Akiyama-san,
0.5;I can't say for sure yet, but I \Nthink I know who his next victim is.
0.5;but all three people who've been \Nkilled so far have names very similar
0.5;to generals who were killed at \Nthe fourth Kawanakajima battle.
0.5;Inspector Takeda, who was murdered \Nfirst, is Takeda Nobushige.
0.5;Lieutenant Kano Shoji, who was \Nkilled next, is Hajikano Tadatsugu.
0.5;who was just killed, used to go by \NAburakawa, so he's Aburakawa Nobuyoshi.
0.5;Saegusa Morinao is only one letter \Noff from Inspector Saegusa Mamoru.
0.5;And then there's the man who felt \Nresponsible for the failed strategy
0.5;and threw himself at his enemies, the \NTakeda army general Yamamoto Kansuke.
0.5;It may have something to do with \Nthe bank case six months ago.
0.5;You mean the case where Inspector \NTakeda shot the suspect.
0.5;The suspect was actually \Nabout to surrender himself
0.5;after responding to the police's \Nefforts to persuade him.
0.5;But the Takeda Squad surrounding \Nthe area decided to act.
0.5;Realizing this, the suspect began \Nfiring his gun inside the bank.
0.5;Takeda-san felt forced to enter \Nthe bank and shot the suspect.
0.5;Kansuke-kun was furious with \NTakeda-san over the incident.
0.5;Don't tell me you think it's okay to \Nkill suspects just because you're a cop!
0.5;Come to think of it, the suspect's \Nphone was lost during the case, too.
0.5;Apparently he was talking to \Nsomeone right until he got shot.
0.5;"He said something like, \N""If I get caught, you're finished."""
0.5;"""They'll know where we got the \Ngun and find out about X."""
0.5;Oh, right. Inspector Saegusa might know \Nmore since he's on the Takeda Squad.
0.5;"Why is Lieutenant Kano's \Naddress under ""ta?"""
0.5;but he took his wife's name \Nafter he got married.
0.5;What does he have against the \Ndead of the Kawanakajima battle?
0.5;Though it seems Kansuke-kun would \Nbe on his hit list either way.
0.5;Chief Kuroda, we got a tip from someone who \Nsays they saw someone who looked like Yamato.
0.5;No. It's just that Saegusa-san \Nis a slightly reckless driver.

0.5;See! No corpses! These brats are\Nprobably just pulling a prank on you!

0.5;I might've figured out the trick\Nthe killer used to hide the body!
0.5;Wait here. I'm going inside\Nto see if I'm right.
0.5;You guys go wait by\Nthe phone booth outside!
0.5;If I do, it's your job to\Ncontact the police right away!
0.5;That's it! That trick\Ncould work if you used this!
0.5;I've got most of\Nthis case figured out now!
0.5;He said he'd contact us\Nusing these miniature transceivers
0.5;What if he's actually trying to\Ntake all the credit for himself?!
0.5;Conan-kun would never\Ndo something like that!
0.5;There's an answering machine\Nand a VCR in this room!
0.5;I thought I heard something in here.\NMust've been my imagination...
0.5;Hey, what's taking so long,\NConan? What're you doing?!
0.5;Dammit! I guess I have no choice now\Nbut to leave my transmitter on!
0.5;You're the one who should\Ngive yourself up, Tanaka-san!
0.5;But it was in the house the entire time,\Nright under our noses, even!
0.5;The corpse I'm referring to is the man\Nwho was sitting in this very room,
0.5;Seeing that we had\Ndiscovered your brother's body,
0.5;you washed all the blood\Noff him in the bathroom,
0.5;put a bathrobe on him,\Nsat him in a chair upstairs,
0.5;then came down to talk to the police,\Nwho had come in search of the body.
0.5;You had boldly disguised yourself\Nas the brother you murdered.
0.5;The two of you have\Nalways looked similar.
0.5;but everybody else would be\Nfooled by such a simple disguise.
0.5;you jumped from the 2nd floor window\Nto the tree, and then over the wall.
0.5;The outer side of the wall\Nacts as an embankment,
0.5;but there was just enough room\Nfor a single person to walk...
0.5;You then returned to the front door\Nas the younger brother...
0.5;...and acted like you had\Nno idea what had happened!
0.5;and the older brother who\Nwas sleeping was the corpse!
0.5;He turned the TV off\Nwhen his brother told him to,
0.5;and he even yelled at you\Nwhen you broke that jar.
0.5;Yes. You tried to make it look\Nlike your brother was really alive.
0.5;And you used the VCR,\Nthe answering machine,
0.5;That shouting was something you had\Nrecorded to the answering machine
0.5;You played it back on\Nthe answering machine
0.5;by using your cell phone's quick-dial\Nfeature at just the right time!
0.5;Of course, you turned off the ringers\Non all the phones in advance
0.5;to make it sound like your brother\Nwas yelling from upstairs.
0.5;As proof of this fact, you picked up\Nthe phone, which didn't ring,
0.5;when a person calling the wrong\Nnumber just happened to call.
0.5;You probably saw the light on the\Nphone blink when the phone call came.
0.5;If you hadn't picked it up, the\Nanswering machine would've kicked in
0.5;and we would have\Nheard him yelling again...
0.5;The TV turned off because you\Nset the VCR's timer in advance
0.5;and then did a little bit\Nof acting of your own.
0.5;Give me a break, will you?\NI'm hanging up.
0.5;You're one smart kid,\NI'll give you that.
0.5;By my worthless brother, who stayed\Nin my house and refused to work!
0.5;I found these documents\Nin your room, Tomofumi...
0.5;Don't worry. We're brothers.\NI won't tell anyone.
0.5;But in return, you'll take care of me\Nfor the rest of my life, right?
0.5;But then he demanded\Neven more money from me!
0.5;Little brat! There's no way\Nfor you to understand how I felt!
0.5;My talented brother, who was\Nprized as a rising new novelist!
0.5;He's disguised as his older brother!\NHe's really gone insane!
0.5;The brother I idolized so much\Nhad become a common leech!
0.5;I'm taking back that brother\Nwho I looked up to!
0.5;I'll use these Power Kick Shoes\Nto finish this!
0.5;Oh no! My kicks are so strong\Nthat they destroy these vegetables!
0.5;Now that you've seen through my trick,\NI can't let you live!
0.5;The authorities arrived\Nshortly afterward.
0.5;The inspector's faith in us\Nwas restored once more,
0.5;"and the case that started as a\N""missing cat"" investigation came to an end."
0.5;Dang, not even catching a\Nmurderer seems to have helped...
0.5;I think this may be tied\Nto another incident!
0.5;We found out later that\NHiroki's cat Akira was nothing more
0.5;than a mischievous cat who liked\Nto sneak into all kinds of places.
0.5;She never led us\Nto any further incidents.
0.5;Your husband was into\Nswordsmanship, I take it?
0.5;Which means that the killer\Nwas quite an expert as well...
0.5;You're confessing that you,\Nyourself, are the murderer!
0.5;Swindle? Don't make such \Ndisreputable accusations.
0.5;You're lying! You never \Nintended to return our money!
0.5;I'm sorry, everyone, but \Nplease leave for the day.
0.5;Lately I've been fearing \Nfor my personal safety.
0.5;I see. That's why you hired \Nme to be your bodyguard.
0.5;It's their fault for being greedy \Nand handing over their money.
0.5;Mori Kogoro isn't rotten enough \Nto sell his soul to the devil!
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;A crooked company president \Nis practically a conman!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""I'm not rotten enough to \Nsell my soul to the devil!"""
0.5;They prevented the victim's \Nblood from getting on them.
0.5;The victim President Tsuchida lied about \Nimporting rare goldfish from abroad,
0.5;I believe the culprit may \Nbe one of his clients.
0.5;You were the first one \Nto discovered the bodies.
0.5;When I returned after buying the \Nitems the president requested,
0.5;It's all right. I'd like to \Nhelp with the investigation.
0.5;But even if the president Tsuchida-san \Nhad incurred the hatred of his clients,
0.5;They were in the building, so I had \Nthem come as potential witnesses.
0.5;And 30 minutes earlier \Nwhen the murders occurred,
0.5;Kitamura-san was at a bicycle \Nparking lot near this building.
0.5;When I tried to leave, I \Nfound that my tire was flat.
0.5;I called a bike shop and \Nwas waiting for them.
0.5;Tsuchida took the entirety of \Nmy store's working capital!
0.5;I had all my son's tuition \Nmoney taken from me!
0.5;In the first place, did anyone \Nsee me at the crime scene?
0.5;I think I saw someone through \Nthe window while I was there.
0.5;Yes, someone heading towards \Nthe president's office.
0.5;The president's office! That's where \NPresident Tsuchida was murdered.
0.5;and why they had to kill Kajiura-san \Nafter killing President Tsuchida.
0.5;First the culprit entered \Nthrough the front entrance.
0.5;They crossed the window \Nfacing the convenience store
0.5;When the culprit entered the president's \Noffice at the end of the hallway,
0.5;they bludgeoned the detestable President \NTsuchida with all their rage.
0.5;and used their knife to kill the \Nfleeing Kajiura-san in this office.
0.5;Killed because he happened \Nto see the culprit.
0.5;Yes. This boy can't be put in \Na tank with other goldfish.
0.5;I'm sorry. I put him in there \Nsince his tank was broken.
0.5;Then there must have been \Nmedicine in the broken tank.
0.5;I sure do. I've loved \Nthem since I was a child.
0.5;Maybe that's why I fell \Nfor this investment scam.
0.5;The truth is, I was too \Nembarrassed to say anything.
0.5;but on the towel discovered \Nin the president's office...
0.5;But there was a type of \Ndisinfectant mixed into it.
0.5;There it is, Mori-san! Has your \Ndeduction so far been incorrect?
0.5;What? No. There was just one \Nthing I wanted to confirm.
0.5;Yes. Every crime has a motive, \Nan order, and a result.
0.5;Considering the towel left at the crime \Nscene, that's a reasonable deduction.
0.5;But what if the truth was the opposite \Nof every reasonable deduction?
0.5;First, the true culprit stole a towel \Nembroidered with the name of Kitamura-san's shop
0.5;and punctured his scooter's tire \Nso he wouldn't have an alibi.
0.5;Next they headed to the president's office, \Nwhere they killed President Tsuchida.
0.5;Naturally, they left the stolen towel \Nin order to frame Kitamura-san.
0.5;they returned to the front \Nentrance and left the office.
0.5;Of course. First, there's the location \Nwhere Kajiura-san collapsed.
0.5;Then there's the towel discovered \Nin the president's office.
0.5;When it was discovered, the towel was \Nwet not only with blood, but also water.
0.5;According to the forensic report, it \Nwas water mixed with a disinfectant.
0.5;Kajiura-san knocked one of them over, and \Nthe water spilled on the culprit as well.
0.5;That's why disinfectant was \Nfound on the culprit's towel.
0.5;If they had killed Kajiura-san \Nafter killing President Tsuchida,
0.5;there would be no fish \Ntank water on the towel.
0.5;They probably brought with them the \Nknife they used to kill Kajiura-san,
0.5;but the sculpture they used to kill Tsuchida \Nwas already in the president's office.
0.5;If they truly did intend \Nto kill President Tsuchida,
0.5;instead of leaving the knife \Nin Kajiura-san's body,
0.5;they would have used it to \Nkill the president as well.
0.5;the true culprit's intended target was \Nnot President Tsuchida, but Kajiura-san.
0.5;the culprit murdered President \NTsuchida, who was hated by everyone.
0.5;Yes. I saw someone heading to the \Npresident's office through the window.
0.5;Conan told me. You don't \Nhave a handkerchief, do you?
0.5;When you killed Kajiura-san, did you use it \Nto prevent his blood from getting on you?
0.5;And the area around your \Nhips is stained, isn't it?
0.5;That's why the letters on this poster \Nbled and stained your clothes.
0.5;The true culprit was soaked \Nby the water in the fish tank.
0.5;If disinfectant were \Ndiscovered on her clothes...
0.5;Nozomi-san, that is the definitive evidence \Nthat proves you're the true culprit!
0.5;Get the forensics team.\NHave them examine her clothes.
0.5;But once he began working \Nfor President Tsuchida,
0.5;And killing a bystander in order to conceal \Nyour guilt is absolutely atrocious!
0.5;I'm impressed you realized \Nthe target was the other person.
0.5;As long as modern-day\Ncrimes involve people,
0.5;there are no\Nunsolvable mysteries!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;We're riding the one up\Nthere, the Yu-no-Yama Line.
0.5;both lines connect\Nto a Tokyo-bound line
0.5;We'll miss the train\Nif we don't hurry!
0.5;My head's pounding\Nfrom this hangover...
0.5;The food, the inn, and\Nthe hot spring were all great!
0.5;as a reward for\Nsolving their case!
0.5;Though I'm the one\Nwho solved the case, not him...
0.5;What's the matter?\NYou don't need to get so mad...
0.5;I can't bear to sit\Nwith you any more!
0.5;Yeah, they stayed at the\Nsame inn as us last night.
0.5;while others took the\NYu-no-Yama Line like us.
0.5;Both lines end at\NHana-no-Machi Station anyway.
0.5;Maybe we should transfer\Nto the Hana-no-Machi Line here?
0.5;The Hana-no-Machi train\Narrived here at exactly 10:30.
0.5;That was five minutes ago.\NIt's long gone by now.
0.5;Sorry to disturb you.\NTickets, please.
0.5;This is our last stop,\NHana-no-Machi Station.
0.5;Passengers transferring\Nto the Tokyo-bound train
0.5;I calmed down after looking at\Nthe scenery from the very last car.
0.5;Hey, Mister! Your button's\Nabout to come off!
0.5;Inside the Hana-no-Machi\Ntrain that arrived five minutes ago!
0.5;What if it's a\Ndoctor from our group?!
0.5;one of them could have been\Non the Hana-no-Machi Line!
0.5;I can't stay silent after\Nhearing there's a dead body.
0.5;Detective Kogoro Mori's\Nexcitement has been piqued!
0.5;So he was in your\Nmedical association?
0.5;It's Utsumi-kun.\NHe was with us last night.
0.5;I'm Chief Railway Officer,\NYosuke Kobayashi.
0.5;Your cooperation is\Ngreatly appreciated!
0.5;We won't know for\Nsure until the autopsy,
0.5;There's a needle\Nmark with blood on it.
0.5;When intravenously given high\Ndoses of potassium chloride,
0.5;people can die with\Nsymptoms just like cardiac arrest.
0.5;Hospitals have potassium\Nchloride and syringes, right?
0.5;But I don't see\Nany syringes anywhere...
0.5;This was neither\Nan accident nor a suicide!
0.5;There's not a\Nsingle yen left in his wallet.
0.5;The killer held him down\Nso hard that it broke his fingers,
0.5;prevented him from fighting back,\Nand then committed the crime!
0.5;Would they really go through\Nthe trouble of giving him a shot
0.5;The Hana-no-Machi line runs\Nparallel to the Yu-no-Yama line,
0.5;The Yu-no-Yama\Nand Mizu-no-Kawa stations
0.5;stopped at Mizu-no-Kawa\NStation at 10:30.
0.5;The question is\Nthe time of the murder...
0.5;So the victim bought the\Ncanned coffee at around 10:50?
0.5;We had almost arrived\Nat Hana-no-Machi,
0.5;I didn't have any 1000-yen\Nbills to give him change with,
0.5;so I gave him his change in coins,\Nwhich is why I remember him.
0.5;Was he sitting\Nby himself at the time?
0.5;a mustached-man in a dark blue\Njacket and sunglasses sat next to him,
0.5;That Dr. Date's\Njacket is reversible!
0.5;Maybe his button\Nwas about to come off
0.5;He broke his fingers\Ntrying to remove it!
0.5;And the victim died from an\Ninjection of potassium chloride,
0.5;which would be difficult\Nfor anyone but a doctor to get!
0.5;Plus his reaction when\Nhe heard the old man's name!
0.5;But how could he have killed\Nsomeone on a different train?!
0.5;Say, aren't you\Ngoing to do your job?
0.5;They've got a search\Nout for the robber.
0.5;That witness lady seems\Na lot richer than the victim.
0.5;Why would the killer go after\Nthe man instead of the woman?
0.5;Say, why do you suppose\Nthat guy's sweating so much?
0.5;You wouldn't happen to\Nknow something, would you?
0.5;I don't mind.\NTell him, Sato-kun.
0.5;Tell him that I had a big argument\Nwith Utsumi at the inn yesterday.
0.5;...that I was receiving kickbacks\Nfrom a pharmaceutical company.
0.5;Oh, man. You don't seriously\Nthink I killed him, do you?
0.5;from what Mori-san\Nand the others have said.
0.5;Say, why did you\Ntake the Yu-no-Yama Line
0.5;Then what was\Nthat argument earlier?
0.5;I tried to pay\Nhim back for my ticket,
0.5;He suddenly got angry\Nwhen I insisted he take it...
0.5;I didn't know what to\Nthink when he blew up like that...
0.5;So Dr. Date suggested\Ntaking the Yu-no-Yama Line
0.5;and then faked an argument\Nto move to the rear car...
0.5;...Mizu-no-Kawa Station\Nwould be the only place to do it!
0.5;But the Hana-no-Machi\Ntrain the victim was on
0.5;arrived at Mizu-no-Kawa\NStation at 10:30.
0.5;Our Yu-no-Yama train\Narrived five minutes later.
0.5;The Hana-no-Machi train\Nwas long gone by then!
0.5;Maybe he couldn't\Nhave done it after all?
0.5;An overpass connects\NPlatforms 3 and 4.
0.5;The stairs are right\Nnext to the rear car,
0.5;Can you close\Nthe office up for today?
0.5;Oh no! I left Sonoko's\Npresent on the train!
0.5;Now I understand the trick\NDr. Date used to switch trains!
0.5;No! It's the killer\NI want you to find!
0.5;Would those involved please\Nassemble in the staff room?
0.5;I've identified the real person\Nresponsible for this incident.
0.5;Don't worry, the truth will become\Nclear in only fifteen minutes.
0.5;You're saying you'll point out\Nthe killer and have him arrested
0.5;In other words, you're going\Nto try to arrest me.
0.5;Yes. The real person\Nresponsible for this incident
0.5;He was on the same\NYu-no-Yama train as us!
0.5;We can only confirm that for the first\Nfive minutes after the train departed.
0.5;The Yu-no-Yama train arrived on\NPlatform 1 of Mizu-no-Kawa Station
0.5;Long after the Hana-no-Machi\Ntrain on Platform 6 had left!
0.5;A single phone call\Nwould make it possible.
0.5;If you call from a cell\Nphone one train stop ahead
0.5;and ask them to hold\Nthe Hana-no-Machi train
0.5;Before you arrived\Nat Mizu-no-Kawa Station,
0.5;and disguised yourself with\Na fake mustache and other props.
0.5;and headed for\NLine 6 as fast as possible.
0.5;That's why you started\Nan argument with Dr. Sato
0.5;and moved to the last car\Nimmediately after the train departed.
0.5;You had the train employees\Nsearch for a missing item
0.5;to delay the Hana-no-Machi\Ntrain's departure,
0.5;allowing you to\Nget on in the nick of time.
0.5;You had probably\Ninstructed the victim to sit there
0.5;"Mori-san's right; there was\Nboth a phone call and a search."
0.5;The man was distressed because\Nhe had forgotten a contract
0.5;Was the call recorded and\Nvoice-matched with my voice?
0.5;I was on the Yu-no-Yama\Ntrain the whole time.
0.5;Ticket inspection took place on\Nthe Yu-no-Yama train at around 10:40.
0.5;Basically, there's no proof\NI was on the train the entire time,
0.5;but there's no proof\NI transferred, either.
0.5;Which platform for\Nthe train to Tokyo, again?
0.5;You certainly had a\Nlot of change in your wallet.
0.5;It's entirely possible that\Nthe killer took the victim's money
0.5;from his wallet--\Nincluding all of his change--
0.5;Sorry, but Utsumi-kun\Nwas with me last night.
0.5;We both chipped\Nin to buy cigarettes,
0.5;so it wouldn't be that\Nodd to find his fingerprints
0.5;I'm not referring to\Nthe victim's fingerprints.
0.5;What do you mean?\NWhose fingerprints would there be?
0.5;He was the last customer,\Nand he pulled out a 10,000-yen bill,
0.5;Yes. That train\Nvendor's fingerprints.
0.5;The fingerprints of the vendor\Non the Hana-no-Machi train,
0.5;If they happen to be on\Nany of the coins in your wallet...
0.5;Then he caught me and\Ntried to blackmail me!
0.5;He said if I didn't pay up,\Nit would become more than a rumor.
0.5;He threatened to send\Nincriminating photographs
0.5;to my medical association\Nand the hospital I work at!
0.5;That's when I decided to\Nagree to a deal to get the film
0.5;I found it hard to believe he\Nwould hand over all the negatives!
0.5;Someday the rumor would\Nbecome the target of investigation.
0.5;So instead, you planned to\Nuse an alibi trick involving trains
0.5;Even the most skilled\Nphysicians are human.
0.5;Unfortunate as it may be,\Neven they make bad diagnoses!
0.5;People are imperfect-- no crime\Nthey commit will ever be flawless!
0.5;Since we're already here,\Nlet's stay another night at a hot spring!
0.5;But another night\Ndoes sound like fun!
0.5;It's not much, but there's\Na fresh scratch mark here
0.5;You're under arrest for \Nrobbing a jewelry store!
0.5;We know you entered a \NBeika City jewelry store
0.5;at 8PM last night and stole 300 \Nmillion yen worth of jewels.
0.5;Your accomplice is Utsumi \NTokuro, thirty-two years old.
0.5;Isn't he the partner you've \Nworked with several times now?!
0.5;Were our faces caught on a \Nsecurity camera or something?
0.5;There's still plenty for \Nus to discuss, Takatori.
0.5;to steal the freshly acquired expensive \Njewels with guns as a pair.
0.5;there was a damning piece of \Nevidence captured by the cameras.
0.5;When the countdown reaches zero, use your \Ndetective skills to produce an answer!
0.5;I'm kidnapped in the middle \Nof solving a mystery!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Rather, while I was explaining my \Nreasoning, that's what happened.
0.5;over redeeming my name \Nafter being interrupted.
0.5;had arrived just before \Nthe store closed?
0.5;They were all expensive jewels \Nworth at least five million yen.
0.5;I assume your delivery \Nschedule was confidential.
0.5;I hadn't even told my employees \Nuntil just beforehand.
0.5;But there's your supplier \Nand the delivery company.
0.5;Weren't there some things \Nyou had no control over?
0.5;Inspector, have you heard \Nfrom Takagi and Chiba?
0.5;The checkpoints haven't reported finding \Nthe car we're looking for either.
0.5;Then we'll have to follow \Nthis thread for now.
0.5;We've got to find a clue to the \Nkid and Takatori's whereabouts.
0.5;I'll have them investigate the jewelry \Nsupplier and delivery company immediately.
0.5;Now that I get a better look, this \Ncar doesn't have a navigator system.
0.5;Huh? Oh, I like going for drives, \Nso I remembered all the streets.
0.5;I don't know what it's for, but you \Ndropped it while you were running.
0.5;I thought there might be a home \Nimprovement store along a city road.
0.5;Actually, if you take me with you, you'll \Nprobably draw even more attention to yourself.
0.5;We could even get license \Nplates from another car.
0.5;We'd know how much they've figured \Nout and what they're looking for,
0.5;Actually, if you take me with you, you'll \Nprobably draw even more attention.
0.5;No matter how you look at it, you're \Nclearly not my dad or brother.
0.5;We could even get license \Nplates from another car.
0.5;We'd know how much they've figured \Nout and what they're looking for,
0.5;I wouldn't mind tying you up and keeping \Nyou in the trunk until we get there.
0.5;Where are we going when he \Nknows I'd slow him down?
0.5;He doesn't have all the \Njewels he stole right now.
0.5;he's most likely going to find the \Nrest of the jewels and his accomplice.
0.5;It was abandoned in the underground parking \Nlot of a shopping mall on Nakahotoke Road.
0.5;So far nobody's reported \Nseeing Conan-kun or Takatori.
0.5;It's got to be wherever the \Njewels and his accomplice is.
0.5;They can't find Yamaga-san, the buyer \Nfor the jewelry store that was robbed.
0.5;It happened as soon as we started \Nchecking their supplier and delivery company.
0.5;If you're even a second late, \NI'll throw this down there.
0.5;If you do that, I'll get caught \Nin the smoke and suffocate.
0.5;Yes. It's probably what the thieves \Npaid him for leaking the information.
0.5;If we looked into the supplier \Nand delivery company,
0.5;we eventually would've discovered that he \Nwas the one person with all the information,
0.5;We'll hand the goods over to him in \Nexchange for money, just like we planned.
0.5;It's covered in soot, so \Nthere aren't any clues.
0.5;Didn't you steal 300 million \Nyen worth of jewels?
0.5;For less than half a share, \Nhe agreed to kill me.
0.5;If you think I won't kill \Na kid, you're dead wrong.
0.5;The body inside the chimney belongs \Nto Takatori's accomplice Utsumi.
0.5;And the fee you owe Utsumi \Nfor hiring him to kill me!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""Conan Kidnapped, Part Two!"""
0.5;Nothing's worse than being \Ninterrupted while you're drinking.
0.5;As soon as the new year started, I \Ngot caught up in an unexpected case.
0.5;It all began when I saved \Nan out-of-control car.
0.5;The owner of the car, Hosoo Takuya, \Nwas the manager of a trading company.
0.5;He was delivering his culturally significant\Ntwo-faced mask to a certain individual.
0.5;Ebizo-san, who is friends with Hosoo, planned\Nto use the mask in February's performance.
0.5;However, the mask, which was entrusted \Nto president Yabusaki-san, was stolen.
0.5;On top of that, Hosoo's secretary Takahashi \NHitoshi-san was found dead inside a car.
0.5;Beside him was the now empty case \Nthat had contained the mask.
0.5;And finally, the accounting manager at \NHosoo-san's company, Shioji Yukari-san.
0.5;But I was attacked by someone \Nin an alleyway in Ginza.
0.5;With the same feelings we've \Nalways held still in our hearts,
0.5;A magnificent finale takes \Nplace on the kabuki stage!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki \NJuhachiban Mystery, Part Two!"""
0.5;Judging by its size, I'm probably \Ntwo or three stories underground.
0.5;You ate the canned salmon the \Nother day while you were drinking.
0.5;Canned tuna is practically the \Nposter child of pull tabs.
0.5;Does tuna even come in \Ncans without pull tabs?
0.5;He wouldn't give me any \Nwhen I asked for a bite.
0.5;It does take longer when you're \Ndealing with foreigners.
0.5;There are a lot of documents \Nthat need to be looked over.
0.5;I wouldn't have made it out \Nif I weren't in this body.
0.5;Yes. Ebizo-san said he wanted \Nto talk to us and the staff.
0.5;We're being treated to dinner \Njust for bringing a can opener.
0.5;I'll never forgive him if he's having \Nsushi at Ichikawa by himself.
0.5;But... You don't have to say \Nit all at the same time...
0.5;As you know, someone stole the two-faced \Nmask I borrowed from Hosoo-san.
0.5;And Hosoo-san's secretary \NTakahashi-san is dead.
0.5;The playwright Iwami-kun \Nis in the hospital as well.
0.5;The least suspicious person is \Nactually the most suspicious.
0.5;"with a new interpretation of the\NKabuki Juhachiban's ""Nanatsu Men."""
0.5;I regret that this project I \Nbegan has turned out this way.
0.5;No matter what, we will \Nmake this play a success.
0.5;The least suspicious person is \Nactually the most suspicious.
0.5;In this work, the other four actors will \Nmake a quick change into modern clothes.
0.5;It's meant to express how \Nhumans haven't changed.
0.5;There are just a bunch of \Nbars on the other side.
0.5;Only Hosoo-san and Takahashi-san's \Nprints were found on the car and case.
0.5;The culprit was willing to kill \Nto get his hands on that mask.
0.5;First, Takahashi-san stole the two-faced \Nmask and tried to sell it to a third party.
0.5;But the culprit killed \Nhim and stole the mask.
0.5;If that's true, then why did the culprit \Nmake it look like Takahashi-san committed suicide?
0.5;It would be odd to spend so \Nmuch time setting that up.
0.5;Thinking he could sell the \Nmask, the culprit stole it...
0.5;Thinking he could sell it, he contacted \NTakahashi-san and negotiated to sell it back.
0.5;And to shift the blame onto him, \Nhe made it look like a suicide.
0.5;If he wanted money, wouldn't \Nhe have sold it to Hosoo-san?
0.5;He's trying to make his crime \Nlook like a suicide now?
0.5;A man about to kill himself wouldn't \Nbother to wipe away fingerprints.
0.5;We can talk about the can \Nopener when I get home.
0.5;I'm looking for Conan-kun, \Nnot the can opener.
0.5;Maybe he's just taking more time \Nin the bathroom than usual.
0.5;Conan-kun has gone missing \Nsomewhere around 4-chome.
0.5;This is my turf, so I'm \Ngoing to go look for him.
0.5;It's definitely connected to \Nthe two-faced mask somehow.
0.5;The last call it received \Nwas from Ran-san at 4:05.
0.5;Since there's no name, \Nhe must've entered the number.
0.5;Anyway, I thought the number \Nmight be on your phone.
0.5;The number alone doesn't \Nring any bells, does it?
0.5;I called a staff meeting \Nearlier, but he wasn't there.
0.5;I'm in the basement of a \Nbuilding being torn down!
0.5;Someone let Mori-san and \Nthe others know about this.
0.5;If anything happens, we'll be in \Ntrouble with the entire country.
0.5;Really? You looked like you're \Nrelieved help came quickly.
0.5;Yeah. There was a camera in \Nthe room on the bottom floor.
0.5;Normal people don't use cameras \Nwith lenses like that.
0.5;So he stole the mask, and while trying to \Nfinish off the kid who was closing in on him,
0.5;I'm sure that's what the \Nculprit wants us to think.
0.5;It's bedtime for the kids, but the \Nadults still have a lot to do.
0.5;If you had your glasses, it wouldn't \Nhave taken any time to find an exit.
0.5;Yeah. I wasn't wearing\Nmy suspenders, either.
0.5;You were drawn there by someone \Nwho may have been the suspect.
0.5;I thought you were with \NSonoko and the others.
0.5;What are Kogoro-no-ojisan \Nand the others doing?
0.5;They're going back to the rehearsal space \Nwith Inspector Megure and the police.
0.5;You're taking a bath when \Nwe get home, Conan-kun.
0.5;It must've been hard being \Ntrapped in there for hours.
0.5;He came after Ebizo-san \Nand Conan-kun visited me.
0.5;You didn't steal the\Ntwo-faced mask, did you?
0.5;Is it true that you came \Nhere during the night?
0.5;But I lost the paper that I \Nwrote the door code down on.
0.5;After all, you had to go the hospital \Nbecause you couldn't write a script.
0.5;If the mask disappears, \Nthe play will be canceled.
0.5;Iwami, you really didn't go \Nto the locker room, right?
0.5;M-Mori-san, the boy gave \Nyou the note, didn't he?
0.5;No, I don't know what note \Nyou're talking about.
0.5;Since I was in a meeting, \Nit must've been on silent.
0.5;Ah, I do have a call from \Na number I don't recognize.
0.5;the death of the secretary Takahashi-san, the\Nkidnapping of Conan, and Kaneko-san's death.
0.5;My detective skills will save the \Ninvestigation time and money, Inspector.
0.5;I'm so excited to see the Sleeping Kogoro's \Ndetective skills with my own eyes.
0.5;Now I need to gather the \Nevidence by tomorrow.
0.5;How long were you planning on leaving \Nthis helpless little girl alone?
0.5;How can you criticize others when you \Nstole this out of someone's camera?
0.5;All of it, but we should \Nstart with Takahashi-san's...
0.5;Being trapped in there for \Nhalf a day really set me back.
0.5;She's right. He wouldn't \Nhave been able to stop.
0.5;Let's get the police's help and \Nsolve this Nanatsu Men case.
0.5;What is it, Conan-kun? \NShouldn't you be in bed?
0.5;Could you come pick me up \Nwithout telling anyone?
0.5;Times may change, but humans shall \Nnever let go of their emotions!
0.5;You're such a great actor, \Nit's a shame, Ebizo.
0.5;Was that an adequate opening \Nperformance to your detective show?
0.5;It's time to reveal the deduction \Nof the great Mori Kogoro.
0.5;This case begins with the \Ncameraman Kaneko Eiji-san.
0.5;He was somebody's pawn and \Nwas killed in that basement.
0.5;The culprit must have struck him \Nwith one of the blocks lying around.
0.5;Kaneko-san, who stole the two-faced \Nmask from Takahashi-san...
0.5;who was desperate to get his \Nhands on the two-faced mask.
0.5;We'll save the story of the Ichikawa sushi \Nrestaurant's shrimp for another time.
0.5;The deduction I just \Ndescribed of Takahashi-san
0.5;stealing the mask does not \Napply to this situation.
0.5;The ATM's camera caught\Nyou withdrawing cash
0.5;from the hospital ATM and \Ngiving it to Kaneko-san.
0.5;I'm sorry. He caught me entering \Nthe building at night.
0.5;The culprit had to have been someone \Nwho was being threatened by Kaneko?
0.5;This is the shot of Iwami-san \Nentering the kabuki theater.
0.5;When Iwami-san was shown this photo, \Nhe did as he was told and paid.
0.5;Iwami-san isn't holding \Na case or anything else.
0.5;Kaneko-san only showed \Nyou what benefited him.
0.5;Kaneko-san's camera told me \Neverything I needed to know.
0.5;Those who weren't captured by Kaneko-san's \Ncamera aren't the culprit.
0.5;Hosoo-san, how do you know he \Ndidn't take a picture of you?
0.5;There's no way because you paid \Nhim a large sum for the chip.
0.5;Have you forgotten that someone tried \Nto kill me by manipulating my car?
0.5;I found that the drops of brake fluid \Nstarted at the top of the hill,
0.5;The most direct path from your house to the \Ntheater is a straight and mostly flat road.
0.5;Why did you go out of your \Nway to go up that slope?
0.5;Also, nearby I found tape \Nwith brake fluid on it.
0.5;As a car enthusiast, Ebizo-san, \Nhave you figured it out?
0.5;so you wrapped tape around the hose you \Nmanipulated in your garage beforehand—
0.5;You saw the footage of the \Nsecurity cameras at my house.
0.5;There's a convenience store \Nin front of your house.
0.5;I compared your footage to \Ntheir security camera footage.
0.5;On the left is the footage of the \Noutside we received from Hosoo-san.
0.5;On the right is the \Nconvenience store footage.
0.5;Can you think of anyone who would have \Naccess to the hardware in your home?
0.5;The two-faced mask was \Nsecured at Haneda Airport.
0.5;Apparently he purchased the mask from \NHosoo-san for a large sum of money.
0.5;We can't have Japanese cultural \Nassets going overseas.
0.5;I can do whatever I want \Nwith my own possessions!
0.5;to take special care of the real mask \Nuntil the day of the performance.
0.5;I tried to convince myself that it was \Nbecause it was broken, but I knew.
0.5;Hosoo-san, I know your company \Nhasn't been doing well.
0.5;You sold the mask for money and took out \Na life insurance policy on Takahashi-san.
0.5;Sometimes it's not paid out \Nin the case of suicide,
0.5;so in order to ensure it would be so \Nsoon after taking out the policy...
0.5;I'm always telling them that if \Nthey're ever kidnapped or attacked,
0.5;You can even bite down on \Nwhatever they throw over you.
0.5;Yeah. Your teeth marks or saliva \Ncan serve as evidence later.
0.5;I was wearing a new jacket \Nwhen we went to the hotel.
0.5;Are you willing to use a child to \Npin Kaneko's murder on me, too?
0.5;Hosoo-san, Conan only said that the \Nculprit covered him with something.
0.5;This button of yours was found in the engine \Nroom of the car where Takahashi-san died.
0.5;These are the traffic drums \Nnext to the railroad crossing.
0.5;You can see the disposable gloves you used \Nto keep the brake fluid off your hands.
0.5;This is the building your \Nprevious office was in.
0.5;It's the building that's \Ncurrently being demolished.
0.5;Kaneko-san saved all the pictures \Nhe sold to you on his computer.
0.5;He was going to use them \Nto blackmail you again.
0.5;No company is worth taking \Nhuman lives to save!
0.5;The place you're standing \Nin now is a place for those
0.5;who hone their craft daily and hold \Nthemselves to a high standard.
0.5;Please let me incorporate the \NSleeping Kogoro into my next play!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Ventriloquist's Illusion, Part One!"""
0.5;There's a hamburger shop called \NYakisobuns near the parking lot.
0.5;since someone I know is \Nalways nagging him to diet.
0.5;This café has lots of cute dishes like\Nparfaits with dolphin shaped bananas
0.5;Ran-san, you suddenly decided \Nto come today, right?
0.5;If you came with her, shouldn't we \Nhave picked a different aquarium?
0.5;I didn't get to see the place \Nbecause of what happened last time.
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;An underwater tunnel like \Nthe bottom of the sea.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;It hasn't been a year, but it seems \Nlike it happened so long ago.
0.5;Did Shinichi already have \Nfeelings for me then?
0.5;Come to think of it, I waited for her \Nhere then in front of these sharks.
0.5;Let's hurry up and check the \Nplace out for your whatever plan.
0.5;It's the Super Aquarium \NRomantic Reunion Plan!
0.5;First I'll invite my dad to this \Naquarium where he'll meet my mom
0.5;They'll remember how they felt \Nwhen they loved each other,
0.5;You suggested an aquarium \Nsince my dad likes fish.
0.5;But couldn't you have come \Nto check it out yourself?
0.5;I know you didn't want to come to \Nthis romantic date location with me.
0.5;Maybe they shouldn't meet \Nin front of the sharks.
0.5;If need an opinion on your clothes \Nthat badly, ask your mom.
0.5;After you checked Sonoko's email, \Nyou checked a previous message.
0.5;I naturally assumed you had plans after \Nthis and were confirming the time.
0.5;You've got fashion magazines you \Ndon't usually buy in your bag.
0.5;There's a business card \Nstuck between the pages.
0.5;Considering your confidence \Nin your outfit today,
0.5;it's clear you were asked to be a \Nreader model, had some shots taken,
0.5;You can brag you might\Nbe in the next issue.
0.5;They don't give business \Ncards to just anyone.
0.5;That's a little out of the way if \Nyou're coming to this aquarium.
0.5;There was somewhere you wanted \Nto go before coming here.
0.5;You don't wear lip balm, so you \Nprobably ate something oily.
0.5;so it's possible you missed \Nbreakfast and grabbed a burger.
0.5;I'd guess you went to look for products that \Nmight be even cheaper come this evening.
0.5;That means you're feeding your dad \Nprepackaged meals for dinner tonight.
0.5;Why would you do that when \Nyou're frugal and good chef?
0.5;Naturally you'll proudly wear the \Noutfit that caught the scout's eye.
0.5;You're not having dinner \Nwith Sonoko, who's sick.
0.5;It was obvious enough from your expression, \Nbut that only leaves your mom.
0.5;But it looks like you have \Nanother reason you can't cook.
0.5;It looks like you ran here because \Nyour photo shoot made you late.
0.5;Ran, go to the entrance\Nand get an employee.
0.5;The weapon is that knife \Nsticking through a plastic bag.
0.5;Seal the aquarium's exits \Nand call the police.
0.5;Yeah. Someone inside the \Naquarium stabbed him.
0.5;When you lick a cut, doesn't \Nit taste like rust or iron?
0.5;allowing them to hear frequencies as low\Nas 40 hertz from two kilometers away.
0.5;determine their prey's exact location \Nby their electric fields, and attack.
0.5;They use all their senses \Nto find the culprit.
0.5;They tear into their prey with \Nthe sharp teeth of evidence.
0.5;So the self-important young man \Ncommanding the crime scene is you,
0.5;I asked if anyone saw the \Nculprit, but no one did.
0.5;If you get flustered, he'll \Nthink it really is a date.
0.5;I'm surprised you can \Njoke when someone's dead.
0.5;It seems the weapon is this \Nknife next to the body.
0.5;The culprit did it to prevent the \Nvictim's blood from getting on himself.
0.5;He turned the blade sideways so it would \Nslip between his ribs and hit his heart.
0.5;If he was knocked unconscious before he \Nwas stabbed, he couldn't have screamed.
0.5;so he was probably stabbed \Na few minutes earlier.
0.5;Also, the stun gun is \Ninside his breast pocket.
0.5;The culprit probably drew the victim's \Nattention to the bottom of the tank
0.5;That way the victim slumped against the \Ntank instead of falling dramatically
0.5;so he could take his time \Nstabbing him to death.
0.5;Then the culprit could be an \Nacquaintance of the victim.
0.5;But there's no license or \Nbusiness card in his wallet.
0.5;We'll have to figure out \Nwho the victim is first.
0.5;The victim is Shumoto Kunihiro,\Ntwenty-six years old.
0.5;Today he canceled his shift \Nbecause he had something to do.
0.5;A woman around 160 centimeters tall \Nin a miniskirt who likes dolphins.
0.5;so I called a random number \Nin his contacts and called it.
0.5;"""I found this phone. Do you \Nknow who it belongs to?"""
0.5;"They told me his name, so I asked, ""I'd like\Nto return it. Do you know where he is now?"""
0.5;They told me where he works, so \NI called the gas station, too.
0.5;I told them the next time \Nthey get a call like this,
0.5;they should tell them to take \Nthe phone to a police box.
0.5;Did his employer tell you \Nabout his lady friend?
0.5;No. I looked at the receipt \Ninside the victim's wallet.
0.5;It was issued about fifteen minutes \Nbefore the body was found.
0.5;The time is five minutes \Nbefore the dolphin show,
0.5;so they probably waited at \Nthe café for it to start.
0.5;The receipt also lists a dolphin key chain sold\Nby the café, but the victim doesn't have it.
0.5;You can smell women's perfume on the \Nvictim's shoulder, elbow, and thigh.
0.5;Women put perfume behind their \Nearlobes, under their hair,
0.5;on their wrists, sides, hem of their \Nskirt, ankles, and all kinds of places.
0.5;If the smell got on the victim \Nwhile she was holding his arm,
0.5;The smell on his elbow is from \Nthe perfume on her wrists.
0.5;The smell on his thigh is from \Nthe perfume on her skirt.
0.5;Based on the locations and her height, \Nshe's probably wearing a miniskirt.
0.5;Normally you only apply \Nperfume to one location.
0.5;Does that mean she doesn't \Noften wear perfume?
0.5;If you wear the same perfume all the \Ntime, you get used to the smell.
0.5;Sometimes you'll apply extra \Nthinking no one can smell it.
0.5;Maybe they haven't been dating long, \Nand she doesn't want to get involved.
0.5;In any case, you should collect all the phones, \Ncameras, and video cameras from the guests.
0.5;Someone may have caught the \Nculprit stabbing the victim.
0.5;I just called the victim's contacts \Nthat didn't respond before you arrived.
0.5;People will turn on their phones \Nfor a police inspection.
0.5;Why did they ignore the \Nvictim's calls and emails?
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Kudo \NShinichi Aquarium Case, Part 2!"""
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut the world is even more so!
0.5;Have you solved\Nthe sealed room mystery?
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;On our way to Okino Yoko's concert,\Nthe old guy lost his ticket.
0.5;But he just happened\Nto meet Aoshima Masayo,
0.5;who promised to give him a ticket\Nif he picked up her younger sister.
0.5;was found dead inside a\Ncompletely-sealed bathroom!
0.5;Not only were the door and\Nwindow taped from the inside,
0.5;"but the word ""goodbye"" was\Nspelled out in tape on the door!"
0.5;Also, because only the sister's\Nfingerprints were found on the tape,
0.5;the old guy and Inspector\NMegure deemed it a suicide, but...
0.5;she bought two bathroom detergents,\Nsome tape, and two cans of beer.
0.5;There were two empty cans in the kitchen,\Nalong with sleeping pills.
0.5;She probably couldn't work\Nup the nerve to kill herself sober.
0.5;So, how did Mina-san\Nseem when she bought it?
0.5;Right... apparently, she seemed\Nno different than usual. It's just...
0.5;So it was clearly a suicide!\NSuicide, suicide!
0.5;Well, you see, the shop\Nowner said something strange.
0.5;But the room was sealed,\Nand it seems clear it was a suicide...
0.5;You should tell the inspector!\NI bet it'll prove it wasn't... a suicide...
0.5;Is it... Is it true\Nthat Mina killed herself?!
0.5;He'd left a message on her machine\Nat her estimated time of death.
0.5;So I looked through her\Naddress book and called him here.
0.5;I would've broken\Nthrough a window then!
0.5;and I waited in front of the door awhile,\Nbut she never came home.
0.5;I figured she already went\Nto bed and left!
0.5;But isn't it strange to visit her\Nafter getting the answering machine?
0.5;And Mina always had\Nthe answering machine on.
0.5;Getting the machine\Ndidn't mean she wasn't home...
0.5;But never mind that, Detective!\NTake me to Mina!
0.5;And the strange\Nfeeling that was bugging me!
0.5;I've figured it all\Nout very clearly now!
0.5;Without question,\Nit was her, Masayo-san!
0.5;She brought us here to\Ncomplete this sealed room murder!
0.5;Unaware she's been holding\Ndefinitive proof the whole time!
0.5;Suicide, suicide! It was clearly\Na suicide, Inspector!
0.5;The tape on the inside of\Nthe door and window
0.5;And judging from the dying\Nwords written in tape on that door
0.5;and the fact only Mina-san's\Nfingerprints are on the tape...
0.5;I can only think that she slit\Nher wrist to commit suicide in here.
0.5;The ticket to tonight's\Nconcert I promised you...
0.5;Wait! Mori-kun!\NWe haven't questioned you yet!
0.5;It's okay, it's okay! I promise to\Ndrop by the station after the concert!
0.5;I've figured out how the killer\Nmanaged to seal this bathroom!
0.5;Killer? You were\Njust saying it was a suicide!
0.5;Yes, please forget everything\NI said earlier. I was only joking.
0.5;Don't be silly! You know\NI'd never kill my little sister!
0.5;Besides, you should\Nknow more than anyone here
0.5;that the bathroom was sealed\Noff and we had to bust the door open!
0.5;If you claim Masayo-san killed her,\Nthen would you mind telling us
0.5;how she miraculously managed\Nto leave a completely sealed room?!
0.5;The method is so extremely\Nsimple that anyone can do it.
0.5;First, Inspector. Please\Nclose the bathroom door for now.
0.5;The tape on the inside is\Nplaced on the glass in such a way
0.5;to make it appear to\Nbe sealed from the inside.
0.5;Masayo-san used this\Nillusion to her advantage.
0.5;Just because your\Nanswering machine is on
0.5;carried her in here,\Nand taped up the window and door.
0.5;there'd be no way to tell when\Nit happened once you went inside.
0.5;B-But you said you had\Na hard time getting inside!
0.5;Yes, I was completely\Nfooled by Masayo-san's acting.
0.5;...it was Masayo-san whose\Nhand was on the knob.
0.5;she made it look like we\Nhad just forced the door open
0.5;and planted the idea in our minds\Nthat this room had been sealed off.
0.5;Of course, she needed someone\Nwho'd fall for this trick for it to work.
0.5;That's why she brought us here.\NTo act as a stand-in for Kenji-san.
0.5;Only her sister's fingerprints\Nwere on these pieces of tape!
0.5;Before killing her sister,\NMasayo-san had her help pack
0.5;by tearing strips of\Ntape off and lining them up.
0.5;She then used that tape to\Nseal the bathroom window and door
0.5;Of course, she wore gloves\Nto keep her own fingerprints off.
0.5;As proof, there are cardboard boxes\Nthat had once been put together
0.5;and tape residue along the table\Nthat the strips had been affixed to.
0.5;The examiner already\Nknows about this, though.
0.5;to buy the necessary tape\Nand two bathroom detergents.
0.5;and kill your sister by mixing\Nthe two detergents together.
0.5;But she had bought the same types,\Nwhich wouldn't produce a gas.
0.5;Having realized this\Nafter sealing the room,
0.5;you quickly chose to cut her\Nwrist so she'd die of blood loss instead.
0.5;Or something along\Nthese lines, anyway, Masayo-san.
0.5;Yes... if it's just as you say,\NI could have done it,
0.5;and I am most suspect, being a\Nformer resident as well as her sister.
0.5;After all, it's possible the room\Nreally was sealed shut with tape.
0.5;I have no clear\Nproof whatsoever of this trick.
0.5;...there are signs\Nthat you killed your sister!
0.5;Definitive evidence\Nthat can't be explained away!
0.5;Kenji-san. You said\Nyou came here last night.
0.5;How long did you ring\Nthe doorbell, would you say?
0.5;She was late for our date,\Nso I thought she might be sulking inside.
0.5;Masayo-san. You were still\Nat home at that time, weren't you?

0.5;But... But so what?!\NMy sister could've left that blood there!
0.5;...a bloodstain that perfectly\Nmatches the one on the front door.
0.5;Masayo-san. It's right there on\Nthe black bandana around your head!
0.5;Now, would you mind\Nexplaining, Masayo-san,
0.5;why your sister's\Nblood is on that bandana
0.5;How do you know she had the\Nbandana on at the time of the crime?!
0.5;"The real logo has a dash over\Nthe first ""o"" to lengthen the vowel."
0.5;The fact it's missing means\Nsomething is covering it up.
0.5;My sister's blood must've\Nlanded there and covered it up.
0.5;You don't own a\Nbandana of your own, right?
0.5;No... something always seemed off,\Nbut I couldn't put my finger on it.
0.5;and learned that Kenji-san\Nhad rung the doorbell last night.
0.5;So this key holder I showed off\Nto you wound up being my downfall.
0.5;B-But why would you kill Mina?!\NYou were such close sisters!
0.5;My sister Mina was always\Nfollowing in my footsteps.
0.5;She'd like the same idols I did,\Nbuy the same bags and clothes I did,
0.5;she'd even copy the\Nfurniture and dishes I had!
0.5;At first, I thought it was cute.\NShe was my little sister.
0.5;she smiled with an innocent\Nlook on her face and told me...
0.5;I fell in love with the same person\Nyou like and confessed to him!
0.5;Yes, that's right. It was you,\Nafter we had gone out for five years!
0.5;and in the end,\Nshe and you got engaged
0.5;I wanted to get rid of the little\Ndevil who stole everything from me!
0.5;I was the one who\Ninsisted on getting married!
0.5;She said she wanted to focus\Non patching things up with her sister.
0.5;Y-You're lying! She said she\Nkept insisting on getting married!
0.5;That was the condition she gave\Nwhen she accepted my proposal.
0.5;She didn't want you to\Nknow I chose her over you,
0.5;Stop with this nonsense! She was\Ntoo selfish to ever think about me...
0.5;There's no way to know\Nyour sister's true feelings now,

0.5;Yesterday the first day ended with \NMaster Katsumata Susumu in the lead,

0.5;Didn't he tell you to open \Nit once he got all seven?
0.5;I was going to open it in front \Nof him the next time we met

0.5;I used it to bookmark a \Npage in a fashion magazine.
0.5;so I threw it out with \Nthe others this morning.
0.5;Besides, I don't want him to \Nthink I changed my attitude

0.5;No, there's only one of \Nit in the entire world.
0.5;The garbage truck is probably still \Nout driving around town, right?
0.5;Yumi threw out something \Nimportant with the garbage.
0.5;You shouldn't have thrown it \Naway if it was so important.
0.5;I bundled it up with some other \Nmagazines and threw it out.
0.5;But apparently they don't \Ncollect recyclables today.
0.5;then the building manager might \Nbe keeping them somewhere else.
0.5;He even left a note telling you \Nthat recycling is on Tuesday.
0.5;I'm surprised the manager knew \Nit was Yumi-san's garbage.
0.5;he probably knows which \Nmagazines his residents buy.
0.5;Oh, you mean an envelope containing \Na marriage registration.
0.5;I wouldn't hesitate, too, if it \Nmeant marrying Master Taiko.
0.5;Yeah, I thought I was as \Ngood as a professional.
0.5;Ten years ago, I heard a middle \Nschool aged pro was coming
0.5;to an event being held \Nat a department store.
0.5;Each time he won a title, I was as \Npleased as though I'd won it myself.
0.5;I caught him trying to steal \Nmy wallet on the train,
0.5;But he said he couldn't find a job \Nonce he finished his sentence,
0.5;so I helped him get a job \Nmanaging the building here.
0.5;where's the envelope that was stuck in \Nthe magazines I put out this morning?
0.5;Hey, wait. It's not on the \Ndesk or in any of the drawers.
0.5;I'm sure he'll give it back \Nto you once we find it.
0.5;He must've written that with great \Nresolution and determination.
0.5;this marriage registration with \Nseven crowns written on it
0.5;Th-Then call him right now to \Ntell him you want to get married.
0.5;Masters don't keep their phones \Non them during a match.
0.5;If you appear holding the \Nmarriage registration,
0.5;he'd defeat all enemies with \Nthe strength of a million men.
0.5;You know where the registration \Nform is, don't you?
0.5;you should be able to \Nfind an envelope or two!
0.5;It even says it has to \Nbe entered by Yodogimi.
0.5;Won't we get it right eventually if we \Njust enter a bunch of random numbers?
0.5;Only Yumi-san is allowed \Nto enter the password,
0.5;Apparently it locks up if \Nyou get it wrong even once.
0.5;If we find the eight digit number \Nhidden somewhere in this room,
0.5;Now that we know what to do, \Nlet's split up and look for it.
0.5;Huh? There was a weird piece \Nof paper in the trash.
0.5;But it seems like what's written \Non that paper is some kind of code,
0.5;That code looks a lot \Nlike the Dancing Man code
0.5;The Sherlock looking at the \Nphoto he took of the code
0.5;Hey, some of them look like numbers \Nif you cover part of them.
0.5;If we put shogi pieces in the \Nright places on top of the paper,
0.5;The shogi board conspicuously placed in \Nthe middle of the room is suspicious, too.
0.5;Now that that's settled, \Nlet's solve this code together.
0.5;Even if that were the case, \Nshe would still let me know.
0.5;I'll win all seven crowns and \Nwait for Yumi-tan's response.
0.5;I don't know which number \Nto start with either.
0.5;Maybe the code can't be solved \Nwith only that sheet of paper.
0.5;that creates an eight digit \Nnumber when you overlap them.
0.5;Or maybe it reveals a sentence \Nthat's a clue to the code.
0.5;So we should look for \Nthe second sheet, right?
0.5;Searching for something reminds \Nme of that time, though.
0.5;When I went to hang out \Nat Chukichi's apartment,
0.5;he was panicking because he \Ncouldn't find an important fan,
0.5;If you imagine you're looking for something \Nthat's mostly hidden, it's easier to find.
0.5;It expresses the importance of \Nlooking at what's on the inside,
0.5;And it's a saying left by the extraordinary \Nshogi master Sakata Sankichi.
0.5;I'm the one who stuck the \Nfan I found on his desk
0.5;in the pen holder while he \Nwas in the bathroom, though.
0.5;he always ate cheese because it \Nwouldn't make his hands dirty.
0.5;so I made him eat an exceptionally \Ndelicious shortcake.
0.5;shogi players eat a lot of \Nsweet desserts while they play.
0.5;This could be just another \Ncoincidence, but...
0.5;there's nothing we can do if \Nwe can't complete the code.

0.5;Why did you suddenly drop \Nin and bring up the past?
0.5;It must be a pretty big case if \NInspector Megure is this desperate.
0.5;I thought the suspect in this \Ncase was already arrested.
0.5;Just before we were going \Nto start prosecuting him,
0.5;When the countdown reaches zero, use your \Ndetective skills to produce an answer!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;As you know, the incident \Noccurred three weeks ago.
0.5;Reigan Yutaka, was found stabbed to \Ndeath in his home in Yotsubadai.
0.5;He was killed the previous \Nnight around eight o'clock.
0.5;He was the victim's nephew and \Nself-proclaimed event producer Maihama Ryuji.
0.5;Maihama purchased the knife \Nthat was the murder weapon.
0.5;Maihama claims he was in his \Napartment in Sasago-cho,
0.5;He also claims he purchased \Nbut lost the knife.
0.5;Apparently he was telling everyone that \NReigan's fortune would eventually become his.
0.5;There's even a witness who saw him at the \Ncrime scene when the murder took place.
0.5;Even after his arrest, Maihama \Ncontinued to deny that he did it,
0.5;However, yesterday, with two days \Nremaining on his detention period,
0.5;At this rate, I'm going to be framed \Nfor murder, so I'll tell you the truth.
0.5;The night my uncle was killed, I was \Ncommitting a burglary in Sasago-cho.
0.5;Now that you mention it, \NI remember that case.
0.5;After staying there for over an hour, \Nhe stole about 500 thousand yen in cash.
0.5;The burglar's face wasn't seen, \Nbut Maihama claims it was him.
0.5;While I was there, I had \Nsomething to drink and eat.
0.5;The teeth marks we collected \Nfrom the food matched Maihama's.
0.5;The burglar entered the \Nhome in Sasago-cho at 7PM.
0.5;Since he was there for over \Nan hour, he left after eight.
0.5;Meanwhile, Reigan was murdered in his \Nhome in Yotsubadai around eight as well.
0.5;It takes over an hour by car to travel \Nbetween Sasago-cho and Yotsubadai.
0.5;So it was impossible for \NMaihama to murder Reigan.
0.5;There's a witness who says he saw Maihama at \Nthe crime scene at the time of the murder.
0.5;He seemed like a bad guy when I saw him \Nat the bar, so I thought I'd frame him.
0.5;I buried it behind my apartment \Nbuilding after I used it.
0.5;It's the same as the one \Nfound in Reigan's body.
0.5;so he wouldn't lose his inheritance and \Nto avoid being convicted of murder.
0.5;It's obvious he'd be a suspect \Nif Reigan were murdered
0.5;so he allowed himself to be \Narrested so he could overturn it.
0.5;The witness who went back on his testimony \Nis working with him, of course.
0.5;He probably just bought \Nanother one of these knives.
0.5;I know he committed the \Nburglary to create an alibi.
0.5;The problem is how in two locations, \Nseparated by an hour's travel,
0.5;a single human committed \Na burglary in Sasago-cho
0.5;Unless we can solve that, even if we \Ncan prosecute him for the burglary,
0.5;which was material evidence, we can't \Nprosecute him for Reigan's murder.
0.5;So we spent all day yesterday \Ntrying to solve the problem.
0.5;But when you're asleep, your detective \Nskills become mind-boggling.
0.5;A burglary and a murder in two \Ndifferent places at the same time.
0.5;Immediately after committing \Nthe burglary in Sasago-cho,
0.5;he killed Reigan who he'd \Nasked to meet him nearby.
0.5;Then he put the body in a car and drove \Nit to Reigan's home in Yotsubadai.
0.5;We're certain that the burglar entered \Nthe home in Sasago-cho at 7 PM.
0.5;had just begun to watch the seven \No'clock news while eating dinner.
0.5;Though she tried to tell him \Nwhere she kept her money,
0.5;Hide-san was suddenly struck \Nand lost consciousness.
0.5;She heard the sounds of a TV \Nshow that starts at eight.
0.5;I can't have you calling \Nthe police right away.
0.5;The second time Hide-san \Nawoke was the next morning.
0.5;After entering at seven and \Nknocking Hide-san unconscious,
0.5;He quickly drove to Yotsubadai \Nand murdered Reigan.
0.5;Then he returned to Sasago-cho, \Nreplayed the video he recorded,
0.5;but because of the audio of \Nthe TV show Maihama recorded,
0.5;and made it appear as though \Nhe'd been there for an hour.
0.5;In other words, Maihama wasn't in Hide-san's \Nhome the whole time after he entered.
0.5;He left and traveled back \Nand forth to Yotsubadai
0.5;This is the first time the \NInspector's asked for my help.
0.5;I forgot to mention that \Nwhen Tenyama Hide-san awoke,
0.5;she heard not only the sounds of the \NTV show, but also a fire truck siren.
0.5;Maihama demanded the location of the \Nmoney while she could hear that.
0.5;We confirmed with the fire \Ndepartment that eight
0.5;was the only time a fire truck was \Ndispatched in Sasago-cho that night.
0.5;If he didn't want his face to be seen, \Nhe only needed to wear a mask.
0.5;There must be some reason he \Nblocked Hide-san's vision.
0.5;Maihama Ryuji was threatening \NTenyama Hide-san in Sasago-cho.
0.5;Not who, but those weird \Nexclamations you always make.
0.5;are we sure Hide-san heard \Nthe fire truck siren?
0.5;It doesn't make sense that \Nshe smelled anything though.
0.5;Maybe hearing the siren made her \Nthink she smelled something.
0.5;She claimed she didn't hear \Na sound she expected to hear.
0.5;It reminds me of all the cases that \Nwere nearly unsolved because of you.
0.5;At this rate, we're going\Nto have to drop the charges,
0.5;Personally, I wish I could \Nadmit to killing my uncle,
0.5;...and stuff myself, I should \Nstart to feel sleepy.
0.5;If Hide-san's perception \Nwasn't wrong, what then?
0.5;And if you consider the culprit blindfolded \NHide-san and knocked her out twice,
0.5;if any fire trucks were \Ndispatched to Yotsubadai that night.
0.5;Yes. I feel refreshed \Nafter using the bathroom.
0.5;Cutting to the chase, \NInspector, Maihama did leave.
0.5;he knocked her out and \Nheaded to Yotsubadai
0.5;Then he murdered Reigan and \Nstarted a small fire nearby.
0.5;He also called in a false report \Nto the Sasago-cho fire department.
0.5;Maihama turned on the TV in \Nhis car and woke Hide-san.
0.5;I looked for your money, but I couldn't \Nfind it, so I've been waiting.
0.5;After getting the money's location \Nout of her, he knocked her out again.
0.5;He took Hide-san back to \Nher home in Sasago-cho,
0.5;and made it seem as though \Nhe was there the whole time.
0.5;but to make her believe she heard the \NTV and siren in her home in Sasago-cho,
0.5;so she wouldn't realize she was actually \Nin a car parked in Yotsubadai.
0.5;Tenyama Hide-san believes she was in \Nher own home the whole time, but...
0.5;She was taken back and forth to \NYotsubadai while she was unconscious
0.5;However, Maihama ended up \Nleaving evidence of his scheme.
0.5;and she didn't hear her \Nbathtub's notification.
0.5;If you examine Maihama's car \Nagain, I'm sure you'll find
0.5;Maihama has a twin with \Nidentical teeth prints.
0.5;This is the only time \NI'm asking him for help.
0.5;We're also considering the possibility \Nof theft as we investigate,
0.5;but to be on the safe side, \Nwe're checking everyone's alibi.

0.5;But I only realized the mistake\Nafter I used my various work contacts

0.5;Even if I could contact him,\Nit wouldn't be until a month later--
0.5;basically, I can't contact\Nhim while he's out to kill me!
0.5;I see. So that's why you\Ncame to the great Mori Kogoro.
0.5;This isn't some\Nhidden camera thing, is it?
0.5;What?! Are you\Nsaying you can't trust me?!
0.5;that's given the\Npolice so much trouble!
0.5;The truth is, I included\Na condition with it!
0.5;I asked him to kill me while I'm\Non one of my beloved traverse trips!
0.5;You mean like a trek\Nup a mountain ridge?
0.5;If it's to be during a traverse,\Nthen what was that attack just now?!
0.5;It's dangerous by the window.\NLet's talk over here.
0.5;There's definitely\Nsomething more to this guy...
0.5;The next day, we set out on a traverse\Nup the Tanbara Mountain ridge.
0.5;We're gonna run out of film before\Nwe even go hiking, Ran-neechan.
0.5;We'll be fine!\NHere, let's get one together!
0.5;Of course! We're here to make\Nit look like you're an ordinary hiker!

0.5;Shortly after, we filled out\Nthe hiking forms at the office
0.5;They faxed the number of hikers\Nand their names to a mountain lodge
0.5;so they could prepare our meals\Nand such before we stayed the night.
0.5;Let's see...\NHere we go, the mountain lodge.
0.5;It's a route for experts,\Nso you better be ready!
0.5;Hey, now. He could be\Nthe Fox, you know!
0.5;I'm Ran! Oh, and this\Nis my little brother, Conan!
0.5;I'm Ushio, from Kansai!\NGood to know you!
0.5;I work for a real estate agency.\NHow about you?
0.5;Given these clouds,\Nthe weather might change.
0.5;He's thrown all his\Nknives with his left hand.
0.5;Oh, Gramps? This is Hirai.\NI'll be staying again tonight!
0.5;Umm, Moriyama-san, was it?\NHave we met somewhere before?
0.5;Oh, the Nose Shingo-san who wrote\NThe Beautiful Amnesiac Case?!
0.5;Oh, wow! I'm so happy to\Nmeet one of my very few readers!
0.5;You read it too, didn't you,\NConan-kun?
0.5;We haven't missed\Nthe check-in time, have we?!
0.5;Looks like it's gonna\Nbe a pretty big group...
0.5;Come to think of it, we don't\Nknow the Fox's gender for sure.
0.5;Sorry to keep you waiting!\NI'm Kawabe! It's nice to meet you!
0.5;Assuming the Fox is going to\Nstrike in this limited time and space,
0.5;he's either waiting in the mountains\Nfor his chance, like a guerilla,
0.5;In short, there's a good chance one\Nof the other five people is the Fox!
0.5;When I consider the Fox\Nbeing one of the traverse members...
0.5;He's been glaring\Nlike crazy this whole time.
0.5;He looks like he has\Nsomething against Ushio-san.
0.5;Plus he was way ahead before,\Nbut now he's with us...
0.5;Whatcha talkin' about?\NAre you people-watching?
0.5;as we approached the final rest\Nspot before our lodging for the night.
0.5;Of course I am! I'm in shape\Nbecause of my karate training!
0.5;There seems to be\Nsomething to those two...
0.5;Shouldn't we hurry\Ndown there and take a look?
0.5;What?! A knife?!\ND-Don't tell me the Fox did this!

0.5;I went on ahead, but came\Nback when I heard screaming.
0.5;I mean, those guys seem\Npretty fishy if you ask me...
0.5;Screw this! These people\Nare nothing but trouble!
0.5;Hold it! We're all going\Nto wait at the mountain lodge!
0.5;I must ask you all to stay\Nwith us until the police arrive.
0.5;Screw that! W-What gives\Nyou the right to do that?!
0.5;Whoever leaves a murder scene\Nwill seem all the more suspicious.
0.5;Moriyama-san. You seem quite\Naccustomed to this. What's your job?
0.5;Are you the manager\Nof this cabin, old man?
0.5;What the-- I'm not\Neven getting a tone! Umm--
0.5;The lines probably got knocked\Nout during all that lightning earlier...
0.5;It's dangerous to go down mountains\Nat night! I'd advise against it!
0.5;Not to mention this is the summit.\NThere are no other cabins nearby.
0.5;Meaning we're pretty\Nmuch completely isolated.
0.5;What the hell?! I can't believe\Nwe're trapped in here with a murderer!
0.5;One of our companions\Nwas murdered in a fake accident.
0.5;Tarnishing these mountains\Nlike that... how shameful!
0.5;Anyway, the killer\Ncould be in this very room.
0.5;Who knows?\NMaybe it was you, Ushio-san.
0.5;It's common sense in mysteries that\Nthe killer is the least likely person.
0.5;What do you think's\Nwrong with Takanashi-san?
0.5;What nonsense! Everyone\Ncarries hunting knives when hiking!
0.5;You're Mori Kogoro-san,\Nthe great detective, aren't you?!
0.5;What's with the false name?\NAre you on some sorta case?
0.5;Personal reasons? Or...\Ncould it have to do with this murder?
0.5;This morning, Tanaka Yoro, 60,\Nwas fatally stabbed in Tanbara Village,
0.5;and the suspects may have\Nfled into the Tanbara Mountains.
0.5;The walls are closing in!\NI'm scared! I'm scared!
0.5;Meaning that's why\Nhe rushed out of the cabin?
0.5;Yeah. And he came here to avoid the rain,\Nbut then it happened again.
0.5;Some land sharks\Nonce held me captive.
0.5;I got them mad when\NI refused to sell my land.

0.5;"On the next Conan: ""The Traverse\Nof Terror Murder Case (Part 2)."""
0.5;Next episode will shock you with \Nbolts of lightning, rolling rocks—
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 982 ""Welcome \Nto Bocchan Restaurant (Part Two)"""
0.5;The day Ayumi-chan took a \Nbadly injured cat to a vet,
0.5;head receptionist Uranari-san \Nwas found murdered.
0.5;the culprit was someone \Nworking at this restaurant
0.5;"that recreates the world of \NNatsume Soseki's novel ""Bocchan."""
0.5;Suspicion initially fell \Non the manager Red Shirt,
0.5;who was involved in a romantic rivalry \Nover the waitress Madonna-san.
0.5;But we learned waiters Bocchan, \NYamaarashi, and Nodaiko
0.5;all had motives for murder \Nand didn't have alibis.
0.5;and the police determined \Nthat he was the culprit
0.5;and killed himself when he realized \Nhe couldn't escape his guilt.
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;Behind the restaurant murders are \Nrelationships that extend beyond the novel!
0.5;The night before last, Uranari-san \Nwas actually killed here.
0.5;The culprit who stabbed Uranari-san \Nused a car or something
0.5;in order to convince us that \NSanshiro Lake was the crime scene.
0.5;So they could frame Red Shirt, \Nwho lives at the restaurant.
0.5;Yeah. No culprit deliberately \Nmakes themselves look suspicious.
0.5;Then there was no reason \Nfor him to kill himself.
0.5;That suicide was faked by \Nthe true culprit as well.
0.5;So that Red Shirt would be framed \Nand the investigation would end.
0.5;But who among Bocchan, Yamaarashi, \Nand Nodaiko is the culprit?
0.5;In any case, we should tell Inspector Megure \Nand the old man about our reasoning so far—
0.5;I want us to be the ones who find the \Nculprit who was so cruel to that kitty.
0.5;Let's find the culprit responsible for \Nthat and nail both of them at once.
0.5;The autopsy discovered something \Nstrange about Red Shirt's body.
0.5;It's about the ladder that \Nwas left by his feet.
0.5;When a person is hanged \Nusing a step of that height,
0.5;But there were signs that a rather strong \Nforce was applied to the body's neck.
0.5;I see! Red Shirt's murder was \Nmade to look like a suicide,
0.5;and the culprit is one of \NBocchan, Yamaarashi, or Nodaiko.
0.5;So, you don't have alibis for \Naround midnight last night,
0.5;No. Judging by the strength of the \Nforce applied to his neck,
0.5;A powerful force was applied \Nto his neck?
0.5;They didn't just lift the body \Nand hang him by the neck?
0.5;The motive for Red Shirt's murder \Nwas revenge for Uranari-san's death.
0.5;I feel like he's already wrong based on his \Nassumption that Red Shirt killed Uranari-san.
0.5;He's just claiming he hated him and \Nactually enjoyed being yelled at.
0.5;The culprit had that kind \Nof peculiar side to them.
0.5;He said he was opening a place called Bocchan \NRestaurant and asked if we wanted to work there.
0.5;He recruited us just after looking at \Nus while I was walking around town.
0.5;but we didn't quit because our \Nconsiderate boss paid us a high salary.
0.5;But now that he's dead, this \Nrestaurant is done for.
0.5;What kind of idiot would \Nhurt themselves like that?
0.5;Besides, even if it's possible that they \Nhated Uranari-san enough to kill him,
0.5;they wouldn't have tried \Nto frame Red Shirt for it.
0.5;In other words, those three \Nare innocent of both murders.
0.5;But that leaves zero people \Nwho had motive and no alibi.
0.5;It was Red Shirt that the \Nculprit wanted to kill.
0.5;they murdered Uranari-san and directed \Nsuspicion towards Red Shirt.
0.5;But regardless of who \Ntheir true target was—
0.5;that means someone else \Nmust be the culprit, right?
0.5;He's being made to dance even \Nthough he's the head chef.
0.5;We brought a gift for the \Nlittle detective crew.
0.5;By the way, where were you last \Nnight and the night before last?
0.5;They're confirming the alibis \Nof everyone involved.
0.5;What I figured out is how the \Nculprit hanged Red Shirt.
0.5;About regardless of whether \Nit was Uranari-san or Red Shirt?
0.5;Either way, maybe the culprit used \Ntheir romantic rivalry against them.
0.5;It doesn't sound like there were \Nany other problems between them.
0.5;Their romantic rivalry started when that \Nlady started working here six months ago, right?
0.5;I believe she said it was because her \Nyounger sister died of an illness.
0.5;"She wanted to fulfill the desire of her \Nsister who loved the novel ""Bocchan,"""
0.5;The sister passed away from \Nsubarachnoid hemorrhaging, right?
0.5;But if she was her younger sister, \Nthen she must've still been young.
0.5;If that's true, that \Nwould explain everything.
0.5;ultimately we'll have to get \Nthe culprit to admit it.
0.5;Did they both harbor \Nromantic feelings for me?
0.5;in front of our customers as \Npart of our business strategy.
0.5;After all, you pushed them towards \Nbecoming romantic rivals.
0.5;With Bocchan, Nodaiko-san, \Nand Yamaarashi-san.
0.5;Of course Red Shirt and \NUranari had feelings for her.
0.5;After all, she made both of \Nthem think she liked them.
0.5;It's only natural that they \Nbecame romantic rivals.
0.5;In order to frame Red Shirt \Nfor Uranari-san's murder.
0.5;I don't know why you think I \Ndid it, but I have an alibi.
0.5;Both the night before last \Nwhen Uranari-san was killed
0.5;and last night when Red Shirt was \Nhanged, you stayed at Kiyo-san's house.
0.5;The night before last you \Njust happened to visit,
0.5;and last night it was because \Nthe murder scared you.
0.5;Both cases happened in \Nthe middle of the night.
0.5;As long as you slipped out \Nwhile Kiyo-san was asleep...
0.5;Normally I wake up to use the \Nbathroom during the night,
0.5;but oddly, these past two nights \NI've slept soundly until morning.
0.5;As though she'd been drugged \Nwith sleeping pills.
0.5;and first invited Uranari-san to \Nthe park the night before last.
0.5;Why did you want to meet \Nin the middle of the night?
0.5;In order to make it seem like \Nthe crime scene was here,
0.5;Ultimately, suspicion fell on Red Shirt, who \Nlives at the restaurant, just as you planned.
0.5;Last night, you asked Red Shirt \Nto meet you, knocked him out,
0.5;and killed him by stringing \Nhim up with a rope.
0.5;Inspector, this was found on \Nthe altar in Red Shirt's home!
0.5;That's probably the weapon \Nused in Uranari's murder.
0.5;he realized he couldn't escape his \Nguilt, so he took his own life.
0.5;If you just wanted Red Shirt's \Ndeath to look like a suicide,
0.5;you could have lifted the \Nunconscious Red Shirt
0.5;But you chose that method because you wanted \Nto get revenge with your own hands, didn't you?
0.5;The branch was strangely damp, and \NRed Shirt's hair was wet, too.
0.5;There's one more thing \Nthat proves your guilt.
0.5;You had to make sure the ice \Nwouldn't melt before you used it.
0.5;The store employee remembered \Nyou buying them.
0.5;Since you're so pretty, you \Nmust've made an impression.
0.5;I am strong, and I did \Nbuy a cooler and dry ice.
0.5;Subarachnoid hemorrhaging \Ncan appear in young people,
0.5;but it also happens if you \Nhit your head really hard.
0.5;I looked into the circumstances \Nof your sister's death.
0.5;Natsumi was pushed four \Ndays ago by two drunk men.
0.5;Even if the patient seems fine at the time, \Nthey sometimes suddenly pass away later.
0.5;they may have been able to determine \Nif it caused her symptoms,
0.5;Her life was taken, but \Nthey'd never be charged.
0.5;It may not have been malicious, \Nbut those two killed my sister.
0.5;I got a job, spent six months \Ndeveloping their romantic rivalry,
0.5;Though ultimately, you Detective \NBoys figured it out.
0.5;If I'd forced Natsumi to go the \Nthe hospital six months ago,
0.5;Excuse me. I'm sorry, but we're \Nquestioning everyone again.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Kid vs. \NKomei: the Targeted Lips, Part One!"""
0.5;General, the tiger is afraid \Nof me and won't come out!

0.5;The Detective Boys came to \NWakasa-sensei's apartment
0.5;After finishing the screen, \Nwhile eating dinner,
0.5;we heard loud music coming \Nfrom the neighboring apartment.
0.5;The unconscious man was professional \Ngolfer Banno Teigo-san.
0.5;The murdered woman was Banno-san's \Ngirlfriend and model Iyama Kurumi-san.
0.5;"The words ""I love you"" were written \Non Banno-san's right cheek in red."
0.5;At the crime scene were \NPolaroids of what appeared to be

0.5;Conan-kun, have you already \Nfigured out who the culprit is?
0.5;The person who killed the \Nmodel Iyama Kurumi-san is...
0.5;The boyfriend who appears \Nto be a victim did it?
0.5;Expose the secret of the \Nrealistic-looking photo!
0.5;his right hand was behind \Nhis head in the Polaroid.
0.5;But you only came here \Nbecause I ruined the screen.
0.5;You were late this morning, \Nwhich was unusual.
0.5;When I checked my fridge as \NI was leaving this morning,
0.5;I rushed to the convenience \Nstore to buy more groceries.
0.5;When I go shopping after school, \Nmost things are sold out.
0.5;wearing a broad-brimmed \Nhat and sunglasses.
0.5;The security camera footage \Nalso captured her
0.5;Also, inside Iyama-san's \Nbag was the camera believed
0.5;Was this really the work of a \Ncrazy fan like Banno-san claims?
0.5;Takagi-kun, go to Banno-san's \Nmanagement agency
0.5;"and check his fan letters for anyone whose \Nhandwriting matches the ""I love you"" note."
0.5;But the killer is that \Nprofessional golfer, right?
0.5;She's trying to see if she \Ncan write on her own face
0.5;There are apps to make \Nyour screen reflective.
0.5;Ai-chan, it looks like you \Nhave a spiral on your cheek.
0.5;Conan-kun, don't laugh \Nat Haibara-san so much.
0.5;Looks like Genta-kun got \Ntired and fell asleep.
0.5;Your sweat must have dissolved the \Npaint and made it stick to your cheek.
0.5;Aren't you going to erase \Nthe spiral on your cheek?
0.5;I accidentally wrote it \Nwith permanent marker!
0.5;You didn't find anyone \Nwith matching handwriting?
0.5;Yes. Banno Teigo-san's agency only \Nhad this month's fan letters.
0.5;In any case, find that letter even if \Nit means turning the agency upside down.
0.5;Banno-san's girlfriend Iyama \NKurumi-san was murdered
0.5;"and the words ""I love you"" were \Nwritten in red pen on his right cheek"
0.5;The media seems to have \Ngotten wind of the incident,
0.5;and have begun gathering around \Nthe apartment building.
0.5;And I'd like to stop by my agency \Nto discuss my next golf tour.
0.5;You're discussing your golf tour when \Nyour girlfriend has been murdered?
0.5;Like that lady teacher said, I invited \NKurumi here to break up with her.
0.5;A-Anyway, the killer is that woman with \Nthe broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses.
0.5;It was probably that woman in \Nthe photo with white hands.
0.5;We need you to wait in your \Nroom until we contact you.
0.5;These children claimed to \Nhave figured something out.
0.5;That's the smell of foundation that \Nwomen use when doing their makeup.
0.5;Remember how we said \Nwe came into this room
0.5;It got on Genta's hand when he \Nbanged on the door to get inside.
0.5;And if you're wondering what \Nthat was doing on the door,
0.5;it's because the woman we \Nsaw banged on the door, too.
0.5;Sensei, do women put \Nfoundation on their hands?
0.5;to make himself paler, and \Npretending to be a woman.
0.5;But what makes me that \Nman disguised as a woman?
0.5;Normally when someone tells you \Nyou have something on your face,
0.5;You'd be curious what color it \Nwas or how much of it was on you.
0.5;So your fingers wouldn't smudge \Nthe words you'd written.
0.5;So you knew there were \Nwords written on your cheek
0.5;that would become an important \Npiece of evidence later.
0.5;One of Iyama-san's fans \Nuploaded the signature
0.5;I traced and enlarged the character \Nfor love that she wrote.
0.5;to show you the message on your \Ncheek, remember what you said?
0.5;You said it wasn't the \Ndead woman's handwriting,
0.5;but you don't even know what her \Nreal handwriting looks like.
0.5;"But like I said, the ""love"" Kurumi \Nwrote and the ""love"" on my cheek"
0.5;It's obvious enough that it's \Nnot Kurumi's handwriting.
0.5;You looked at the mirrored \Ncharacters reflected on the phone
0.5;and instantly knew it wasn't \NKurumi-san's handwriting.
0.5;But it's hard to tell whose it is \Nwhen reversed, even if it's familiar.
0.5;In any case, the important thing \Nis this Polaroid the killer took!
0.5;so the white woman's hand \Nin the front isn't mine.
0.5;Plus, I couldn't have written \Nso clearly on my own face.
0.5;If you think I did it, tell \Nme how I took this photo.
0.5;Yes. Go ahead and fall \Nlike Conan-kun told us.
0.5;doesn't Mitsuhiko's left hand \Nlook like Genta's right hand?
0.5;your girlfriend's left hand could \Nhave looked like your own right hand.
0.5;For her sleeve, you could \Ncut the sleeve off another
0.5;similarly colored shirt and wrap it \Naround her left hand under your head.
0.5;on a clear plastic file \Nusing permanent marker.
0.5;Then you flipped it over and traced \Nthe words with a non-permanent marker.
0.5;After killing your girlfriend \Nand taking a photo of yourself
0.5;with nothing on your face, \Nyou created the stamp.
0.5;Then you colored your right \Nhand white using foundation,
0.5;you disguised yourself as a woman \Nand lurked around your apartment...
0.5;When Kurumi-san arrived, you \Nkilled her with your golf club
0.5;and took the trick photo using the \Ntechnique Conan-kun just described.
0.5;Then you played loud music from your \Nstereo so your neighbor Wakasa-sensei
0.5;would come and discover the body, \Nand showed us the trick photo
0.5;so we would believe the \Nsuspicious woman did all this.
0.5;my initial theory about \Nthe imaginary girlfriend
0.5;If only you didn't have \Nthat spiral on your cheek.
0.5;The proof's probably in that bag you're \Ntrying to take out of the apartment.
0.5;and sleeve you put on \NKurumi-san's left hand...
0.5;You wouldn't want anyone to \Nsee you leaving the apartment
0.5;I wanted to go on my international \Ntour with a blank slate.
0.5;But she demanded 100 million \Nyen for breaking up with her!
0.5;I doubt your international tour \Nwould've gone well anyway.
0.5;You probably lost the \Nfavor of the god of golf
0.5;in the home of professional \Ngolfer Banno Teigo-san?
0.5;Grade school teacher saves\Nthe day... Wakasa Rumi...
0.5;Why are we having cake \Nfirst thing in the morning?
0.5;That can't happen! We have \Nto catch the culprit!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan \Nis ""The Melting Cake!"""
0.5;After watching the BIG Osaka \Nversus Tokyo Spirits game,
0.5;Haibara the Higo super-fan was in a great \Nmood because she got a phone strap of him,
0.5;Mitsuhiko's phone that was coincidentally \Nrecording a video captured
0.5;a man with his son who were riding \Non the same train picking up her strap.
0.5;Amuro-san, who was parked in front of \NProfessor Agasa's house, became involved,
0.5;and together we set out to \Nsearch for the strap, but...
0.5;And low tide at Chiyari \NBeach is at 5:59 today.
0.5;When digging for clams, it's best to \Narrive an hour or two before low tide,
0.5;We'll be able to retrieve \NHaibara-san's strap!
0.5;Once that boy realizes the strap \Nhis dad picked up isn't his,
0.5;we won't let anyone else take it \Nuntil we return it to Ai-chan!
0.5;Inscribing love and cases \Nwith deductive reasoning!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Let's hurry up and get \Ninside Amuro-san's car.
0.5;because she lost the Higo \Nstrap that he himself touched?
0.5;Seeing her like that reminds me that \Neven though she normally acts so cool,
0.5;she's actually an 18 year-old \Ngirl on the inside.
0.5;It's easier for us if she \Nremains a young girl.
0.5;I received a message saying \Nthe situation is complicated.
0.5;I've boarded the Shonan Shinjuku rapid \Ntrain that departed Takasaki at 13:14.
0.5;It's the center door on the left \Nside facing the direction of travel.
0.5;I'm in front of the center \Nleft door of car three.
0.5;Uh, Furuya-san, what exactly \Nare you investigating?
0.5;I'll set my bow tie-shaped voice-changer \Nto loudspeaker mode, and...
0.5;Yoshida Yuto-sama from Tokyo, \Nyour friends have arrived.
0.5;Once again, Yoshida Yuto-sama from \NTokyo, your friends have arrived.
0.5;That train gets crowded at Shinjuku \NStation near the Toto Stadium,
0.5;which means they either got \Non when we did or after that.
0.5;Mister, you picked up a soccer \Nplayer strap on the train, right?
0.5;He was standing near the Chiyari Station \Nlost and found when we went there,
0.5;and I think he was sitting behind Ayumi-chan \Nat the family restaurant we just visited.
0.5;There's only one strap like \Nit in the whole world!
0.5;...must be a flash drive \Nwith top secret data on it.
0.5;and Haibara-san asked the clerk \Nto sell her the display product.
0.5;One person picks up the display product and puts \Nsomething inside it while pretending to look at it.
0.5;But your friend bought the \Ndisplay product first.
0.5;While following her in \Norder to get it back,
0.5;your friend dropped the \Nstrap when the train shook.
0.5;He took advantage of the opportunity to pick \Nup the strap, but it was the wrong one.
0.5;When he went to the station's lost \Nand found to turn in the strap,
0.5;Since it seemed like you'd find \Nthe strap he wanted for himself,
0.5;he resumed following you and waited \Nfor an opportunity to steal it.
0.5;He wasn't dressed like \Nsomeone digging for clams.
0.5;They'd probably get mad at us \Nif we interrupted their digging.
0.5;Since we're small, we can slip \Nthrough the crowds to look for him.
0.5;In this case, we might actually be more \Neffective than your average police officer.
0.5;In any case, loudly describe \Nthat man's appearance
0.5;It's like you're using the Baker Street \NIrregulars to gather information for you,
0.5;I didn't think you'd be so desperate to \Nfind the phone strap your friend lost.
0.5;Has anyone seen a tall \Nman wearing a flat cap?!
0.5;Our friend is watching the \Nexits, so you can't escape!
0.5;Maybe he's planning to blend \Nin with the people leaving.
0.5;You could immediately remove \Nyour hat and jacket,
0.5;and stuff them into one of \Nthe bags sold at the store,
0.5;but you can't change your pants \Nwithout visiting the changing room.
0.5;Listen, I just came to change into \Nshorts so I could go digging for clams.
0.5;That proves you hastily put it \Non as soon as you bought it.
0.5;So you are the man who stole \Nthe Higo strap from us.
0.5;I see. So those are his \NPower-Enhancing Shoes.
0.5;Yeah. I splurged on it, so I was worried \Nif it was actually still inside there.
0.5;While checking it on the train,\NI dropped it when the train shook.
0.5;I went to pick it up right away, \Nbut it was a different strap.
0.5;I saw the father and son \Nstanding nearby pick it up.
0.5;I thought I'd explain the situation \Nwhen they got off and exchange straps,
0.5;but Chiyari Station was full of \Npeople there to dig for clams.
0.5;so I thought if I turned in their strap \Nto the lost and found and waited there,
0.5;we won't let anyone else take it \Nuntil we return it to Ai-chan!
0.5;In other words, three people dropped \Ntheir straps when the train shook.
0.5;It must have gotten in there \Nwhen you tripped on the train.
0.5;It must've fallen with his badge \Nwhen Genta put on his hood.
0.5;So it should be around here \Nwhere Genta put on his hood.
0.5;The left eye had come off, so we \Ndrew it on with a magic marker.
0.5;but if you don't mind, the \Nmedicine to restore my body...

0.5;The next special episode of Conan is “The \NScarlet School Trip, Bright Red Arc!”
0.5;There were rumors announcer \NMizunashi Rena was a patient here.
0.5;An injured man caused a panic trying \Nto force his way into a room.
0.5;Come to think of it, we found a damaged \Nvehicle a few days before the bomb scare.
0.5;There was blood all over the \Ninside of the damaged vehicle.
0.5;Some of the bloodstains were \Nless than a millimeter across.
0.5;Bloodstains less than a millimeter \Nacross from a high speed blood spray...
0.5;Propelled forward by the \Nyears spent together.
0.5;Charging full speed ahead \Nwithout slowing the pace.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Have you gotten used to your \Nelementary school teaching job?
0.5;Yes. She got involved in a case \Nwhile studying abroad in America.
0.5;She also taught me Japanese and helped \Nme go undercover as an English teacher.
0.5;My client and someone who might help\Nme fill in the last piece I'm looking for.
0.5;It must be the man from\Nthe detective agency.
0.5;It wouldn't be strange for a \Nforeigner to drive a foreign car.
0.5;Your priority is retrieving \Nthe transmitter and bug.
0.5;If you hesitate out of curiosity \Nor some sense of righteousness,
0.5;The organization spy who infiltrated \NMizunashi Rena's hospital.
0.5;Once Shu cornered him, \Nhe shot himself in the head.
0.5;Did you make me pick you \Nup just to tell me that?
0.5;Actually, we'd like you to \Ncome to the crime scene.
0.5;The history on her phone\Nwe found in the park
0.5;showed she spoke with\Nyou before eight last night.
0.5;According to the person who reported \Nit from a nearby public phone,
0.5;You called her from my \Nphone last night, right?
0.5;We couldn't identify her \Nuntil this afternoon.
0.5;We followed that lead and discovered \Nthe victim was Shibuya Natsuko-san.
0.5;Later, we found her phone abandoned \Ninside the park and asked you to come.
0.5;Natsuko-san was probably \Nattacked for her money
0.5;Were those answer sheets blank \Nwithout anything written on them?
0.5;I think some had even scored 100 points \Nand had flower circles on them.
0.5;Kobayashi-sensei said you're not supposed \Nto take home completed answer sheets.
0.5;The school doesn't want anyone's \Npersonal information getting out.
0.5;But if they'd already been graded, \Nshe couldn't have been doing that.
0.5;The culprit stuffed the papers \Non her desk inside her bag
0.5;to make it look like she was \Nattacked on her way home.
0.5;If her skull was dented, it's possible \Nshe was struck by a blunt object.
0.5;They must've thought they could trick \Nus by pushing her down the stairs.
0.5;Come to think of it, Natsuko said she was \Nmeeting a student's parents that night.
0.5;Look through her call \Nhistory and e-mails again.
0.5;Anyone who had plans to meet her \Ncould be important to this case.
0.5;There's a luminol reaction \Non the victim's desk.
0.5;But, Sugamoto-sensei, didn't you say \Nyou'd give Shibuya-sensei a ride?
0.5;It's dangerous for a woman to \Nwalk around at night by herself.
0.5;Its engine is acting up, \Nso I came by train today.
0.5;Which class are you in? \NI don't recognize you.
0.5;These are the people who were \Nsupposed to meet Shibuya-sensei.
0.5;I don't know what's going on,\Nbut I need to get ready for dinner.
0.5;transported to Haido Park, \Nand pushed down the stairs.
0.5;It was the woman you were supposed to\Nmeet last night, Shibuya Natsuko-sensei.
0.5;Fortunately, the surgery was a success, \Nbut she's still unconscious.
0.5;In any case, will you tell us why you \Nwere meeting with Shibuya-sensei?
0.5;I just came to tell Shibuya-sensei \Nto stop seducing my son.
0.5;I don't care if she's from America, \Nher skirts are too short.
0.5;It's no wonder the children love \Nher and her skimpy clothes.
0.5;I came to complain to that \Nirresponsible teacher.
0.5;She marked my daughter's answer wrong \Nbecause her handwriting was poor!
0.5;but the lights were out and the gate \Nwas closed, so I didn't see her.
0.5;Yeah. All her wrong answers \Nwere actually right.
0.5;She should've scored 100 with a flower \Ncircle, but she gave her a 60 instead.
0.5;Want me to show you my \Ndaughter's answer sheet, then?
0.5;Yeah. I followed her so I could talk to her \Nat home when he grabbed me by the collar.
0.5;I see you guys in movies \Nand TV shows all the time.
0.5;Their investigators show up at crime \Nscenes to steal all the credit,
0.5;smugly interfere with the investigation, \Noffend the local police, and annoy the viewer.
0.5;We don't want him to know the FBI knows \Nhe's a member of the Organization.
0.5;You're the one who reported \NShibuya Natsuko-san's incident?
0.5;Yes. In addition to investigating her \Nstalker, she asked me to serve as her bodyguard.
0.5;I meant to watch her take her \Nusual shortcut through the park.
0.5;Y-You said someone pushed\Nher in your report.
0.5;The silhouette of the culprit standing at the \Ntop of the steps, looking down at Shibuya-san.
0.5;Later I heard the sound of a car \Nstarting from above the stairs.
0.5;They probably put the unconscious \Nvictim in their car,
0.5;brought her to the parking space \Nin the park near the stairs,
0.5;confirmed there was no one watching, \Nand pushed her down the stairs.
0.5;They probably couldn't see my car at the \Nbottom since it was hidden by the trees.
0.5;But why didn't you wait at \Nthe scene until we arrived?
0.5;Investigator Jodie and \NShibuya-sensei were friends.
0.5;Then it could be the work of \Nsomeone who resented the FBI.
0.5;So far those three are the only ones who met \Nor planned to meet Shibuya-sensei last night.
0.5;We need to find the person who \Nknocked Natsuko unconscious
0.5;in this faculty office before taking her to \Nthe park and pushing her down the stairs.
0.5;I'd like to hear every last detail \Nof what you did last night, too.

0.5;I, the great Mori Kogoro,\Nhave figured out the Fox's identity.
0.5;That's amazing. The great Mori\NKogoro-san is truly impressive.
0.5;Judging from the angle\Nof the knife in her body,

0.5;I am a writer. Observation and\Ncuriosity are vital tools of the trade.
0.5;Might another vital tool be your\Nleft-handedness, which you're hiding?
0.5;You're most likely a lefty who\Nlearned to be right-handed, right?

0.5;Yes! The peerless Fox,\Nthe one behind these incidents...

0.5;What I mean is, she may've been\Nstabbed from behind with a left hand,
0.5;but couldn't she have\Nbeen stabbed from the front, too?
0.5;The killer stabbed\Nher from behind like so.
0.5;Well? It could've been done\Nwith the right hand like this.
0.5;But it wouldn't be very\Neasy to stab her this way...

0.5;I know you're planning to take \Nhalf my father's fortune, too.
0.5;Miss, don't you think you're \Noverthinking things?
0.5;I know you've been secretly letting \Nthem use this hotel for their trysts.
0.5;I hope you haven't forgotten \Nyou're my fiancé.
0.5;Seriously? Don't you know \Nhow much that's worth?
0.5;Kick the guests out of the \Npool and block off this area.
0.5;I thought you might say \Nthat, so I brought one.
0.5;You're in the way of my search, \Nso get out of the pool.
0.5;B-But, miss, wouldn't it be \Nfaster if we all helped?
0.5;I wanted to play in the pool, \Nbut then that happened.
0.5;I guess it's okay since the \Nhotel's lunch was really good.
0.5;The hotel's bellboys seem \Nexcited about something.
0.5;We searched the changing room \Nand bathroom next to the pool.
0.5;Th-There's something in\Nthe middle of the pool.
0.5;Th-There's something in\Nthe middle of the pool.
0.5;There was nothing in the pool \Nwhen we looked ten minutes ago.
0.5;There are shards of glass \Non the bottom of the pool.
0.5;Yes. According to the coroner's report, \Nshe died between noon and 1 PM.
0.5;She was wearing a tank and weights \Non her hips so she wouldn't float.
0.5;Nagami-ojosama said she wanted \Nto focus on searching the pool.
0.5;The victim is Oiso Nagami-san, \Ndaughter of Oiso Finance's president.
0.5;And? What was she doing \Nat the bottom of the pool?
0.5;We noticed it was missing \Nwhile rubbing suntan oil on her.
0.5;We thought she may have dropped \Nit while swimming in the pool.
0.5;the four of us searched the\Nbathroom, changing room, and pool.
0.5;But my sister said she \Nwanted to search alone.
0.5;If she panicked and lost the mouthpiece \Nshe was breathing through,
0.5;They said there was nothing in the \Npool ten minutes before she was found.
0.5;The three of them and two of us came \Nto the pool to look for Nagami-ojosama,
0.5;When we came back ten minutes later, \Nshe was at the bottom of the pool.
0.5;Which means after drowning her around \N1 PM, someone hid the body somewhere.
0.5;And at 2 PM, they sank her body in the \Nmiddle of the pool without being seen.
0.5;Was it possible for someone \Nto have done that unnoticed?
0.5;There was something weird \Non the bottom of the pool.
0.5;You stepped on them and cut \Nthe bottom of your foot.
0.5;I carried her tank to the side of the \Npool, but when I tried to get out...
0.5;When I looked underwater, I saw a \Nbunch of glass shards at the bottom.
0.5;Were these here when you were \Nsearching the pool with Nagami-san?
0.5;With all these pieces, we won't know what \Nthe original shape was unless we repair it.
0.5;There are four corner pieces \Nlike the one you're holding,
0.5;and four L-shaped pieces like the \None Inspector Megure is holding.
0.5;Put it together in your head, \Nand you get an aquarium.
0.5;Why was there an aquarium in the \Npool, much less a shattered one?
0.5;by recreating the necklace \Nwith fishing line and glass.
0.5;Maybe they drew her somewhere \Nby pulling it through the water.
0.5;Meanwhile, we'll ask exactly how they \Nended up looking for the necklace.
0.5;Those three individuals \Nconnected to Nagami-san.
0.5;Yes, but she said I was \Nterrible and told me to stop.
0.5;I accidentally scratched \Nher and made her angry.
0.5;But we noticed her necklace \Nwas missing and stopped.
0.5;Seriously? Don't you know\N how much that's worth?
0.5;Kick the guests out of the \Npool and block off this area!
0.5;I thought it would be possible to take off her\Nnecklace while rubbing suntan oil on her.
0.5;She would make you touch her \Nforehead because she felt feverish.
0.5;It was cute the way she enjoyed \Nwatching people's reactions.
0.5;Naturally, I knew she would \Ninsist on searching alone.
0.5;She was very particular \Nabout everything she did.
0.5;I accepted her selfishness \Nas part of her individuality.
0.5;But didn't Nagami-san say\Nher fiancé Samaki-san
0.5;I know you're planning to take \Nhalf my father's fortune, too.
0.5;She said the hotel manager was \Nletting them use the hotel to meet.
0.5;I know you've been secretly letting \Nthem use this hotel for their trysts!
0.5;If that's true, that would \Nbe motive for murder.
0.5;We were planning to celebrate in the \Nsuite since she loves this hotel.
0.5;Since it was a surprise, we \Ndidn't tell Nagami-ojosama.
0.5;We were high school classmates, \Nand we'd been dating since then.
0.5;She really did like that room, so \NI'm not surprised she was angry.
0.5;First, I'd like to hear what you were \Ndoing after you left Nagami-san alone.
0.5;After drowning Nagami-san, who was \Nsearching for her necklace alone...
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “The Mystery \NSinking in the Midsummer Pool, Part Two!”
0.5;In the lounge you'll find \Nbubbles in your champagne.
0.5;that Organization member \NAmuro Toru, codename Bourbon,
0.5;we were informed her friend Shibuya \NNatsuko-san was pushed down some stairs.
0.5;but at the elementary \Nschool where she worked.
0.5;Three suspects were called \Nin for questioning.
0.5;smugly interfere with the investigation, \Noffend the local police, and irritate the viewer.
0.5;We don't want him to know the FBI knows \Nhe's a member of the Organization.
0.5;Charging full speed ahead \Nwithout slowing the pace.
0.5;Amuro says something strange, but the \Nmystery of the answer sheets comes first!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;I really was organizing the gym's \Nstorage until after 8:30 last night.
0.5;It was late, so I came to the staff office to \Nwalk Shibuya-sensei home, but she wasn't here.
0.5;I just thought she'd feel safer going \Nhome at night with a man around.
0.5;You once confessed your feelings for \NShibuya-sensei, and she rejected you.
0.5;when I came here to investigate \NShibuya-sensei's stalker.
0.5;Rather, I made sure she didn't \Nnotice me and watched over her.
0.5;It was so cute when she'd \Nsense me and look around.
0.5;Could she have pointed this \Nout and made you angry?
0.5;Besides, didn't she have graded \Nanswer sheets inside her bag?
0.5;As a fellow teacher, I know she's \Nnot supposed to take those home!
0.5;Oh, yes. When I met her last \Nnight, she was grading them.
0.5;You mentioned you met with Shibuya-sensei \Nto ask her not to seduce your son.
0.5;Natsuko mentioned she'd become the \Nhomeroom teacher for class 1-C.
0.5;A first grader falling in\Nlove with his teacher?
0.5;I warned her to be more modest precisely \Nbecause he's still an impressionable child!
0.5;Also, my child is in the \Nfifth grade, not the first!
0.5;He had a crush on a different \Nclass's homeroom teacher?
0.5;Shibuya-sensei is fluent in English \Nbecause she studied in the United States.
0.5;She teaches English to \Nthe upper grade levels, as well.
0.5;He spent his money on a \Nhalf-girl he met at a bar.
0.5;After taking all his money,\Nshe abandoned him.
0.5;I don't want my son to \Nfollow in his footsteps.
0.5;But everyone around me is \Ntrying to corrupt him...
0.5;I had to sell it to pay \Noff my husband's debts.
0.5;I had to take the train \Nto work and a bus here.
0.5;You said you came here \Nbefore nine last night.
0.5;Like I said, the school was \Ndark and the gate was locked.
0.5;It was probably after that stalker or \Nold woman got her and took her away.
0.5;after Ueno-san left and \Nbefore Sugamoto-san arrived.
0.5;So your appointment with \NShibuya-sensei was around nine?
0.5;But there was an unsent message \Non Shibuya-sensei's phone reading,
0.5;If you're asking, then there \Nmust not have been an addressee.
0.5;Maybe it was meant for the old lady, \Nand she arrived while she was writing it.
0.5;the equations filling her head with \Nnumbers must have confused her.
0.5;Forensics has them right now, \Nso all we have are photos.
0.5;They may be simple problems, but all \Nthese numbers could confuse a person.
0.5;"In America, they write ""excellent"" \Non tests that score 100."
0.5;I'm asking if that's all you \Ncan deduce from this photo.
0.5;Well, in Japan they draw flower \Ncircles for correct answers.
0.5;The answer sheet on top \Nmust be graded correctly.
0.5;After you saw the photo, \Nyou started staring right at the culprit.
0.5;I always wondered why she hired a \Ndetective to investigate her stalker
0.5;If you don't have visas, \Nyou must not have many days left.
0.5;If you're finished enjoying the sights, \NI wish you'd get out...
0.5;First, look closely at the \Nphoto of the answer sheets.
0.5;"""Zero"" is the nickname given to the \Norganization that ""doesn't exist."""
0.5;I thought he'd help us avoid the worst \Nif we explained our situation.
0.5;He'll definitely do something \Nto find out, though.
0.5;Tell us. What's wrong \Nwith these answer sheets?
0.5;Look closely at the answers on the top \Nsheet and the one hidden below it.
0.5;but the top sheet is marked with a \Ncircle and the other with a cross.
0.5;And Hirai Umihiko's answer \Nsheet is covered with crosses,
0.5;There's no way the FBI and \NOrganization agent Bourbon
0.5;But the message was on her phone, \Nand she can be pretty forgetful.
0.5;Investigator Camel, you lent her your \Nphone because hers was dead, right?
0.5;I'm trying to reveal who did \Nthat to your teacher friend.
0.5;In Japan, we circle correct answers \Nand mark wrong answers with crosses.
0.5;But in America, they mark \Ncorrect answers with crosses.
0.5;Japan marks correct answers \Nwith checks as well.
0.5;They mean the answer is wrong, \Nso you should review the problem.
0.5;Not every teacher circles \Nwrong answers, though.
0.5;and the one on top was graded \Nby a Japanese culprit?
0.5;And aren't the circles on the top sheet rather \Nwarped and sticking out from the answer spaces?
0.5;Or was trying to hide something \Nred with a red pen.
0.5;When the culprit struck her, \Nher blood got on the ungraded sheets.
0.5;When he used the red pen to \Nhide it, it warped his circles.
0.5;The question is which of \Nthose three people did it.
0.5;It's obvious who drew the flower \Ncircles when you look at the photo.
0.5;Compare Shibuya-sensei's flower \Ncircle with the culprit's.
0.5;That means the culprit isn't Sugamoto-sensei \Nwho wiped his sweat with his right hand,
0.5;or Ueno-san, who accepted Camel-san's \Nhandkerchief with her right hand,
0.5;but Kandachi-san, who used his left \Nhand to turn on his lighter, right?
0.5;A left-handed person's swirl \Nwould be counter-clockwise.
0.5;I'm left-handed, but I draw my \Nflower circles from the inside.
0.5;On both flower circles, the line tapers \Noff on the inside of the swirl.
0.5;Besides, didn't you say \Nshe got the time confused...
0.5;A grade school teacher \Nteaches other subjects,
0.5;so how did you know she \Nwas grading math tests?
0.5;"Tell us if you've got an answer other \Nthan, ""I saw it at the crime scene."""
0.5;When I yelled at her for grading wrong, she \Nsaid it was a habit from her time in America.
0.5;I didn't know Japan and \NAmerica grade differently!
0.5;Natsuko was wrong for not \Ngrading Japanese style,
0.5;but shouldn't you have understood \Nif you saw the answer sheets?
0.5;I didn't want cops to find her hair in my \Ncar, so I asked a friend to hold onto it.
0.5;Shibuya-sensei's condition has \Nworsened, and her life is in danger!
0.5;I'm surprised you knew I \Nregained consciousness.
0.5;It's partially my fault this happened, \Nso I asked them not to tell the school.
0.5;The information didn't make it down \Nto a lowly investigator like yourself.
0.5;I'd never tell him he \Nshot himself in the car.
0.5;It happened before I was assigned to \NJapan, so I heard about it from Akai-san.
0.5;A voice and disguise that \Ncould fool an acquaintance...
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Scarlet Intersection!"""
0.5;But that night, the legendary \Nmonster known as the Nue appeared,
0.5;Tanzawa Michiki-san was also \Nmurdered in his hotel room.
0.5;we heard him barking and \Nscratching at the wall.
0.5;Come to think of it, when we \Nfirst heard the nue's cry...
0.5;He beautifully dances his \Nmystery-solving steps!
0.5;After solving the mystery of the \NNue, what will Heiji say to Kazuha?
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""Conan and Heiji's Nue \NLegend, Resolution Arc!"""
0.5;Three sets of sheets from an \Nunused room, a deck brush,
0.5;Then there's a cardboard box and the \Nspray used to remodel the hotel.
0.5;In the desk drawer of the\Nroom Ran and I moved into
0.5;Isn't that the excavation \Nteam from sixteen years ago?
0.5;So, what are you going to \Nmake with all this stuff?
0.5;Hey, there isn't some other reason you \Ndon't want the sun to rise yet, is there?
0.5;But Hattori-sama asked me to gather \Neveryone in front of the hotel...
0.5;...because he discovered \Nthe identity of the nue.
0.5;Come to think of it, the forensics \Nteam and my men were sneaking around.
0.5;It's burning just like it was \Nwhen the monster appeared.
0.5;No, dummy. Come over here \Nand take a closer look.
0.5;Look. There's even a snake \Ntail attached to it.
0.5;drew some windows on them \Nin extreme perspective,
0.5;and spray painted them the \Nsame color as the wall.
0.5;And since that tree's in the \Nway, you can't see the building.
0.5;When there's smoke in the air, you \Ncan't see the trees behind us.
0.5;On top of that, in the darkness of \Nnight, it's no wonder we were fooled.
0.5;were secretly helping him \Nput together this trick.
0.5;They trained the dog to \Ncarry away this little sign
0.5;so it'd look like a giant \Nmonster killed Someji-san
0.5;He was barking because he wanted \Nto go to the sign, but couldn't.
0.5;The nue's cry could have \Nbeen produced the first
0.5;or second time using a \Ncell phone or something...
0.5;But we heard its cry when \NTanzawa-san was poisoned, too.
0.5;Hadn't you taken everything we \Ncould've used to make any sound then?
0.5;and trace the edge of the \Nglass with a moist finger...
0.5;with windows from that \Nspot and made that sound
0.5;is the person staying in that room \Non the second floor who asked
0.5;you'd be able to draw realistic \Nlooking windows on the cloth.
0.5;And when we chased the monster \Naround the back of the hotel,
0.5;you could've erased the evidence \Nby setting the cloth on fire.
0.5;But when did she paint \Nthose windows on the cloth?
0.5;She probably painted them beforehand \Nand hid it in this room.
0.5;Someone was coming here occasionally \Nto feed the dog, right?
0.5;She had to train the dog to pull \Nthe sign out of the ground, too.
0.5;Masuko-san may have planted this tree \Nfor the sake of this trick, too.
0.5;B-But the second time the grass \Ncaught fire, she was in her room.
0.5;If you wrap it in something flammable \Nlike paper or grass and pour water on it,
0.5;When we put out the first \Nfire, Masuko-san had a bucket.
0.5;she could have faked putting out the fire and \Nstrewn it over the grass in front of the hotel.
0.5;you heard the sound of a carbonated \Nbeverage being opened.
0.5;and stuck a ball point pen \Ntube emptied of ink in it.
0.5;so it would fit perfectly \Nin the soda water bottle.
0.5;By shaking the bottle, she was able \Nto shoot water at a distant target.
0.5;I was able to make the \Nsame thing using the spare
0.5;bottle of soda water and \Nwine cork the mayor bought.
0.5;Furthermore, if you point the bottle \Nupwards and release your finger...
0.5;By attaching a two-pronged \Npoison dart to the cork
0.5;and shaking the bottle while holding \Nit in place with her finger,
0.5;she was able to poison Tanzawa-san \Nby releasing her finger
0.5;And by attaching a string to the poison \Ndart, she was able to quickly retrieve it.
0.5;After hanging the cloth painted with \Nwindows from your second story room,
0.5;you invited Someji-san outside with a \Nletter or something and murdered him.
0.5;left the sign with large \Nteeth marks next to the body,
0.5;switched the real sign \Nout for the little one,
0.5;poured kerosene over the grass in front \Nof the hotel, and set it on fire.
0.5;went around the back of the \Nhotel, and headed back inside.
0.5;While pretending to put out the fire, you \Nscattered metallic sodium in front of the hotel
0.5;and sprayed water on it \Nwithout spraying it on us,
0.5;When Tanzawa-san stuck his head out \Nof his window to look at the fire,
0.5;The first man was killed by a \Ntiger, and the second by a snake.
0.5;You made it seem as though both of \Nthem had been killed by the nue.
0.5;but if forensics hasn't found the \Ndart you used to kill Tanzawa-san,
0.5;it's probably still inside \Nthe pens you have on you.
0.5;I practiced countless \Ntimes so I could hit him,
0.5;Member of the excavation \Nteam and my husband,
0.5;He wrote the name of a \Nmonster on a piece of paper.
0.5;Charles was trying to write \Nthat he found a metal hairpin,
0.5;but as a foreigner he'd \Nnever seen one before.
0.5;and the piece of paper \Nto ask them what it was.
0.5;Since he wrote the word slowly \Nusing a permanent marker,
0.5;"making the team think he \Nwrote ""n-u-e"" instead."
0.5;You wrote in your letter that Charles \Nmay have found metal jars instead.
0.5;"""In the morning and evening sun, two thousand \Njars glitter with a thousand golden coins"""
0.5;And the two of them came, \Ndrawn by that possibility,
0.5;I planned to forgive them \Nif they didn't come,
0.5;You invited a detective so \Nhe'd testify that the monster
0.5;so she'd be frightened when \Nshe found the creepy notebook
0.5;You predicted that Tanzawa-san \Nwould offer to trade rooms
0.5;She wanted her son to watch \Nas she avenged his father.
0.5;So you'd better write a \Nbetter one this time.
0.5;About the idiot woman who got \Na taste of her own medicine
0.5;who transformed into the beast \Nso her son could slay it.
0.5;She headed towards Kurogane \NLake with Heiji-niichan.
0.5;But I think you should \Nleave them alone for now.
0.5;If you're planning to show me another \Nweird monster, give me a break.
0.5;The morning sun turned the \Nsurface of the lake gold.
0.5;"two thousand jars glitter with \Na thousand golden coins."""
0.5;In other words, the lake \Nitself is a metal jar.
0.5;When the light from the rising and setting \Nsun strikes the lake, it turns gold,
0.5;I didn't realize it until the \Nincident at the Ebisu Bridge,
0.5;If they did come, I guess it \Nwould be the Hamamatsu ADSF.
0.5;I was just going to say that gruel does \Ntaste better when you mix the egg into it.
0.5;Huh. Looks like you're \Nmaking quite the splash.
0.5;It's nothing for a detective \Nto involve himself in.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NMysterious Prophetic Buddha!"""
0.5;It's your fault for kicking \Nit someplace weird!
0.5;A beautiful woman is \Ndrinking alone in a park.
0.5;Jeez. Sticking their noses where \Nthey don't belong again...
0.5;Why do you have two glasses \Nwhen you're alone in—
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;By the way, Tomoko-san, \Nare you sure this is okay?
0.5;It's fine. Spending the weekend \Nalone was boring anyway.
0.5;Well, I doubt she has time to be \Nsad while handling those kids.
0.5;I wasn't sure what would happen when \Nshe started crying in the park,
0.5;The friends of Yoshida Ayumi-chan, a girl \Ndressed in red, are looking for her.
0.5;Please come to the information \Ncenter if you have any information.
0.5;I think this is the lost girl \Nfrom the announcement just now.
0.5;It's fine. I'm just glad \Nyour daughter is all right.
0.5;Kajiki Kohei-san, you're \Na company president?
0.5;In this day and age, men need to take \Nproper care of their appearance, too.
0.5;Kajiki-san, do you often \Ncome to botanical gardens?
0.5;I said the same thing in a \Nmagazine interview the other day,
0.5;but I love the outdoors and \Nfrequently go on walks alone.
0.5;By the way, Kajiki-san, \Ndo you have a girlfriend?
0.5;Oh, my. In that case, what \Nkind of women do you like?
0.5;Does Tomoko-san seem \Ntotally different to you?
0.5;What? I mean Tomoko-san is trying \Nto match Kajiki-san's tastes.
0.5;I'm delighted there are meatballs \Nin this lunch. They're my favorite.
0.5;I was thinking how happy I would be \Nif I could eat like this every day.
0.5;Since she invited us to \Nher house, I doubt that.
0.5;Since she's been looking after you \Nkids, I thought I should thank her.
0.5;Are you sure you didn't come because \Nyou heard Tomoko-san is beautiful?
0.5;Before her husband passed away, \Nit was probably the two of them.
0.5;I invited you here today because \NI have something to tell you.
0.5;We were eating and chatting \Ntogether just now.
0.5;Afterwards we had a drink, \Nand he began to feel tired.
0.5;The deceased is Kajiki \NKohei-san, forty-five years old.
0.5;He was the president of a \Nmen's cosmetics company.
0.5;Forgive me, but what was your \Nrelationship with Kajiki-san?
0.5;Judging by the situation, \Nfoul play seems unlikely.
0.5;When we came to the terrace, \NKajiki-san tripped and fell.
0.5;Yes. Kohei-san received a call after \Ngetting drunk and falling sleep.
0.5;Woken by his ringtone, he hurriedly \Ntried to answer his phone.
0.5;However, his hand slipped, \Nand he dropped his phone.
0.5;He got up to collect his \Nphone from around the edge,
0.5;Because the railing he \Ngrabbed onto was rotten,
0.5;Based on the victim's blood alcohol \Nconcentration, we know he was drunk.
0.5;it seems likely that his \Ndeath was accidental.
0.5;There isn't a scratch on it even \Nthough it was dropped on the ground.
0.5;not because he dropped it, but \Nbecause someone put it there?
0.5;There's only one person who \Nhad full access to this house.
0.5;She made his phone appear to be \Nfloating in front of the step.
0.5;I'll recreate it for you using this \Nspray bottle that was in the hallway.
0.5;First, place the phone on \Nthe step near the edge.
0.5;Then use this to wet the \Nfloor away from the phone.
0.5;You're right. It looks like \Nthe phone is floating.
0.5;When the drunk victim saw this, even \Nif he thought it seemed strange...
0.5;But the key to this illusion isn't that \Nthe phone appeared to be floating,
0.5;but that the phone appeared \Nto be in front of the step.
0.5;In other words, woken \Nby his phone's ringtone,
0.5;Kohei-san thought he could reach \Nhis phone before he hit the step.
0.5;Believing he was safe, he went to \Npick up his phone without much care.
0.5;But his phone was actually \Non top of the step.
0.5;He misjudged the situation and tripped on \Nthe step before he could reach his phone
0.5;Because this illusion vanishes \Nonce the ground dries,
0.5;Kajiki-san used foundation to \Ncover his wrinkles, didn't he?
0.5;but there were no signs that \Nhe rubbed around his eyes.
0.5;However, there was something that looked \Nlike fingerprints on his upper and lower eyelids.
0.5;No one would open their eyes to \Nremove just one of their contacts.
0.5;It's only natural to assume someone \Nopened them for him and removed one.
0.5;you changed your mind about removing \Nyour handkerchief from your pocket.
0.5;Perhaps the foundation you wiped from your \Nfingers is still on that handkerchief.
0.5;Because a large difference in acuity between \Nyour two eyes disrupts your depth perception,
0.5;it became extremely likely that \NKohei-san would trip over the step.
0.5;There's most likely foundation \Non Komori-san's handkerchief
0.5;and the phone used to call Kajiki-san's \Nsomewhere in this house.

0.5;He said in a magazine interview \Nthat he liked kids.
0.5;In order to catch a big fish, you \Nneed to catch some little ones first.
0.5;Komori Tomoko-san, you can tell \Nus the rest at the station.
0.5;It seems like she was committing \Nthe same crime over and over.
0.5;I suppose you can't judge \Na person by their looks.
0.5;There must be some reason a \Nwoman is climbing a tree alone.
0.5;This is called glamping \Ninstead of camping, isn't it?
0.5;He's dressed like a woman, has \Nsloppy scribbles on his face,
0.5;a crab leg in his mouth, \Nand a note in his hand.

0.5;A racing second hand,\Na returning satellite!
0.5;Conan's logic is good medicine\Nfor hearts tired by modern society!
0.5;It's the lively JDL again!\NThis year's Conan is a little different!
0.5;I'll smash 'em with a\Nmid-section to upper body kick!
0.5;Ran's always tense on\Ndays she has karate matches...
0.5;Conan-kun!\NYou better come cheer me on!
0.5;Yeah... I'll come\Nright after school!
0.5;You better! I absolutely\Ncan't lose to my opponent today!
0.5;or else I'll meet\Nthat roundhouse again!
0.5;Just the voice\NI don't wanna hear...
0.5;No, Genta-kun!\NIt's called a wideband receiver!
0.5;It can even pick up taxi and\Ncordless phone conversations!
0.5;Rairaiken? I'd like three\Nramens and two dumplings...
0.5;But, isn't it wrong to listen in\Non people's phone conversations?
0.5;Whoops, I'm in trouble if\NI don't go see Ran's match...
0.5;I know! Let's listen in on\NNamuro Amie, that singer!
0.5;This receiver only picks up random\Nsignals within a 1 kilometer radius.
0.5;until you find someone\Ntalking, like before.
0.5;Let's wait and see! \NOkay, Conan-kun?!
0.5;Not good. At this rate,\NI'll get stuck with them, again...
0.5;Looks like you\Nhaven't called the cops.
0.5;What are you going to do to her?!\NI'll do anything you want!
0.5;Your satellite dish is\Nin the way! Take it down!
0.5;The kidnapper is watching\Nhim from somewhere!
0.5;He probably told him to go onto\Nthe veranda to see him better!
0.5;I'd forget about calling\Nthe cops if I were you.
0.5;Do anything funny and I'll\Nkill your daughter on the spot!
0.5;What do we do?!\NShouldn't we tell the police--
0.5;What is it you want?! Money?!\NDo you want money?!
0.5;Don't get worked up.\NJust wait there for a while.
0.5;He's right! All we know is that a\NJunko-chan might've been kidnapped!
0.5;We don't have time to go\Nto the police and sit around!
0.5;I learned something\Nfrom that last call.
0.5;What're you getting\Nyour math notebook out for?!
0.5;It's Professor Agasa's\NElectronic Map Notebook!
0.5;That receiver picks up\Nsignals within a 1 kilometer radius.
0.5;The victim's home\Nis somewhere in this circle.
0.5;And, that faint sound\Nin the background...
0.5;It was a train. The victim\Nprobably lives along a train line.
0.5;There's only one railway\Nthat goes through this area!
0.5;These are the only tracks\Nwithin the receiver's range!
0.5;In other words, the victim is\Nalong this 600-meter length of track!
0.5;But, isn't there\Nany other way, Conan?
0.5;The kidnapper told him to\Ntake down his satellite dish, right?
0.5;Satellite dishes\Nare pointed to the southwest.
0.5;Which means the victim has\Na veranda facing southwest, but...
0.5;Great! Now give\Nus some sort of hint!
0.5;I got it! He's making him\Ngo to a public bath nearby!
0.5;Good! Some high school girls are\Nabout to pass below your apartment!
0.5;Or, do you not care what\Nhappens to your daughter?!
0.5;How's it feel to be made fun of\Nby high school girls in sailor uniforms?
0.5;I could hear quite a few high school\Ngirls over the wideband receiver...
0.5;That apartment building is likely\Non the way to a girls' school.
0.5;The only girls' schools\Nin that 600 meter area
0.5;are Seijun Girls' Academy\Nand Beika Girls' High School...
0.5;I bet high school girls always\Nmade fun of the kidnapper.
0.5;Seijun uses blazers.\NBeika uses sailor uniforms.
0.5;I used to dream about wearing a\Nsailor outfit when I get to high school,
0.5;but lately I've been considering\Na blazer and loose socks, too.
0.5;That narrows it down\Nto a 300 meter radius!
0.5;Maybe we should ask\Nsome high school girls?
0.5;That's it! The victim\Nlives behind a temple!
0.5;It sounds like a taiko drum!\NThe kidnapper must be playing along!
0.5;Yeah! The machines that pound\Npiles in at construction sites!
0.5;But, finding construction\Nsites around here would--
0.5;If we follow that,\Nit'll lead us to a construction site!
0.5;This narrows it down\Nto a 150 meter radius!
0.5;I know how it feels.\NI used to be a parent myself...
0.5;The little girl who fell\Nto her death one year ago...
0.5;I'm sure you remember, as it\Nwas from your apartment building.
0.5;Tomidokoro-san?! \NIs this Tomidokoro-san?!
0.5;That's right. I'm the one\Nwhose daughter you murdered.
0.5;Someone had picked it,\Nor it just broke by chance!
0.5;One whole week earlier! So why\Ndidn't you do anything about it?!
0.5;So it was nobody's fault?!\NQuit screwing around!
0.5;I'm gonna let you experience\Nthe same sadness I did!
0.5;It took 8.2 seconds after it passed\Nuntil I heard it on the receiver!
0.5;I heard the train on the receiver 8.2\Nseconds after it passed the crossing!
0.5;In other words, the victim's house\Nis 27.8 meters x 8.2 seconds away!
0.5;A building around here with\Nverandas facing south or west!
0.5;That's the man whose\Ndaughter was kidnapped!
0.5;That just leaves\Nthe kidnapper's location...
0.5;I'll do anything you say!\NJust spare my daughter's life!
0.5;Now I see! The kidnapper's\Ngoing to force him to kill himself
0.5;to get revenge without\Ndirtying his own hands!
0.5;Thrust the knife into your\Nthroat and I'll let your daughter go.
0.5;So, you don't care\Nwhat happens to your daughter?
0.5;Just let me talk\Nto Junko one last time!
0.5;I hate this smell!\NIt smells like rubber!
0.5;What buildings near the factory\Nhave a view of the victim's veranda?
0.5;Which one?!\NWhich apartment building?!
0.5;The only one downwind from it...\Nis that building!
0.5;Somewhere in that building are\Nthe kidnapper and Junko-chan!
0.5;Conan! Do something, quick!\NHe's really gonna kill himself!
0.5;I'm gonna let you experience\Nthe same sadness I did!
0.5;No, uh, he was so surprised\Nwhen I showed up
0.5;Guess that means\Ngood riddance to these things!
0.5;But, at least it was useful\Nbefore it broke, Mitsuhiko-kun!
0.5;Yeah! You mean Mori Ran?!\NShe was awesome!
0.5;So, the clincher was\NRan's special roundhouse kick?

0.5;Sonoko suggested to Ran and Sera \Nthat they form a girls band.
0.5;and the police couldn't \Nfind the murder weapon.
0.5;Meanwhile, Sera seemed to find \Nsomething about Amuro-san suspicious.
0.5;why don't we solve the \Ncase that's happening now?
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;But finding the missing \Nmurder weapon comes first.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;If that's the case, x-ray us \Nor do whatever else you want.
0.5;We're open to anything \Nif it'll clear our names.
0.5;Anyway, have you examined \Nthe other bands yet?
0.5;The other day, with a \Nband we performed with...
0.5;You're making this girl with the \Nfreckles sing instead, right?
0.5;Well, your vocalist did kill \Nherself after ruining her voice.
0.5;Um, who is this vocalist \Nwho committed suicide?
0.5;that half the security \Ncamera's image was cut off
0.5;by looking at the monitor \Nat the reception desk, right?
0.5;If they knew the girls had \Na habit of doing that,
0.5;they may have been able to find \Nthe studio they were renting.
0.5;Then someone could've used that \Nsituation to sneak into the studio,
0.5;strangle the victim, and \Nleave with the weapon.
0.5;it looks like we'll have to investigate \Nthe other bands' members.
0.5;But we let a few groups leave since \Nwe had our eyes on these girls.
0.5;Which of you first suggested \Nthat you form a band?
0.5;Akane could play the guitar, bass, \Nand keyboard in addition to singing.
0.5;The only thing she kept doing was \Nknitting, which Rumi taught her.
0.5;but the rest of you ended \Nup being better than me.
0.5;I want to see the practice video \Nyou said you filmed in the studio.
0.5;so we don't have video \Nof the culprit, though.
0.5;because it didn't seem to have \Nanything to do with the case.
0.5;Wouldn't the band fit into the shot \Nbetter if you shot it horizontally?
0.5;Our feet would be cut off \Nif we shot it horizontally,
0.5;And it's interesting how it's \Ndifferent from a TV screen.
0.5;was strangled using a rope \Nor string-like weapon.
0.5;She even had Yoshikawa lines \Non her neck that indicate
0.5;she struggled while \Nshe was being strangled.
0.5;there must be a weapon with Yamaji-san's \Nblood on it somewhere in this studio,
0.5;We investigated all the \Nstrings in the studio,
0.5;didn't the victim's bandmate Kibune \NSomeka-san change one of her guitar strings?
0.5;Her guitar was the first thing we \Nexamined, but we didn't find anything.
0.5;Could the culprit have cut the string \Nup and flushed it down the toilet?
0.5;Then someone in a different band \Nmust've strangled Yamaji-san
0.5;then they've probably already \Ndisposed of the weapon.
0.5;We couldn't get in touch with a \Ncouple of them, so not all of them.
0.5;That means one of the \Nthree remaining members
0.5;It's these three who are helping \Nus with the investigation.
0.5;you should be able to find \Nit somewhere in the studio.
0.5;the weapon has already been \Ntransported outside the studio.
0.5;Because... you're not the\Nones who took it outside.
0.5;Because... you're not the\Nones who took it outside.
0.5;The police took the victim's\Nbelongings to the station,
0.5;But there weren't any \Nstrings in her possessions.
0.5;What if that string had been \Nknitted into something else
0.5;The weapon is a piece of \Nyarn knitted into that hat.
0.5;a piece of yarn the same color \Nas Hagie-san's hat with them.
0.5;they removed the decoration \Non the top of the hat,
0.5;replaced the decoration, \Nand put it on her head.
0.5;Since they folded up a \Nlarger section of the hat,
0.5;On top of the snare drum \Nto the left of the victim
0.5;Tadako-san repaired the button that \Nwas falling off Someka-san's jacket.
0.5;Someka-san was replacing \Nher broken guitar string.
0.5;And Rumi-san was fixing the \Nsong you were working on.
0.5;who could've prepared \Nfor that beforehand.
0.5;You could've prepared \Nwhat you did beforehand,
0.5;and the guitar string \Nbreaking were coincidences.
0.5;Not only that, but the guitar was one \Nthey rented from the studio today.
0.5;She couldn't have\Nmanipulated the guitar string
0.5;so it would be more likely \Nto break beforehand.
0.5;She could've pretended to play the \Nkeyboard while she was knitting.
0.5;Apparently you were good enough \Nat knitting to teach the others.
0.5;that it ended up in front \Nof the security camera.
0.5;by looking at the video \Nand offering our opinions.
0.5;after seeing the video of \Nyou performing together.
0.5;I saw that video, too, but \NI didn't notice anything.
0.5;The position of the drums is \Nalready set and can't be changed.
0.5;So the position of the phone \Nbeing used to shoot the video
0.5;depends on the keyboard \Nin the top left corner.
0.5;In other words, Rumi-san could \Ncontrol where the phone would be set
0.5;so it would be covering half \Nthe security camera image.
0.5;and the phone would disappear \Nfrom the camera's frame.
0.5;After blocking half the \Nsecurity camera's image,
0.5;you pretended to go wake Hagie-san, \Nand strangled her with the yarn.
0.5;You used her drumsticks to \Nknit the yarn into her hat,
0.5;and returned to the break room \Nlike nothing had happened.
0.5;B-But unless she knew Hagie-san \Nwould sleep on the drums...
0.5;If she always did, by mixing sleeping \Npills into Hagie-san's drink,
0.5;would return to the studio \Nalone to nap against her drums.
0.5;with traces of sleeping pills on it if you \Nsearch the garbage cans in the studio.
0.5;And tell forensics to examine \Nthe victim's knit hat.
0.5;Kogure Rumi-san, could you \Ncome with us to the station?
0.5;I couldn't have removed the \Npom-pom on top of her knit hat.
0.5;You knew Tadako-san would lend you \Nhers if you let your nails grow out.
0.5;It means you knew you wouldn't \Nbe practicing anymore today.
0.5;I'm sure they'll find her blood \Nand your fingerprints.
0.5;Modern forensic investigators \Ncan even collect fingerprints
0.5;Rumi would never use that \Nknit hat as a murder weapon!
0.5;After all, Rumi and Akane were the closest \Nin the band, and she knit that hat!
0.5;She took her seriously \Nand gargled with liquor,
0.5;and pressed a cushion against \Nher face and screamed
0.5;Well, nothing we can do now. Tadako, \Nyou'll have to sing at our next concert.
0.5;Akane jumped in front of \Na car and killed herself.
0.5;It was a boy who ignored the \Nlight and jumped into traffic.
0.5;Akane was hit by a car \Nwhile trying to save him.
0.5;Probably because Akane did \Nwhat Hagie told her to do.
0.5;"She said, ""Don't speak \Nuntil your voice recovers."""
0.5;"""You'll get your beautiful \Nvoice back in no time."""
0.5;"""I'm sorry for saying something \Nso stupid when I was drunk."""
0.5;said she jumped into traffic to save \Nthe boy instead of calling out to him.
0.5;because you were bedridden \Nfrom the shock of Akane's death.
0.5;The murderer's screams of regret \Nrang throughout the studio,
0.5;I'm only a detective because of \Nmy brother's influence, though.
0.5;Apparently he had a hard \Ntime getting his green card.
0.5;But you saw your brother on a \Nstation platform in Japan, right?
0.5;Then maybe the guy who taught you \Nhow to play the bass was an FBI agent, too.
0.5;He was probably a friend my brother \Nmet while he was on vacation.

0.5;I didn't notice at the airport, \Nbut they're packed differently.

0.5;You'll notice the paintings packed at \NNarita Airport were packed differently.
0.5;That's because they were \Npacked by different people.
0.5;"""Despair"" was packed by \Nthe president and an employee."
0.5;"Now look at ""Scream"" \Npacked at Haneda Airport."
0.5;Why were paintings packed at two \Ndifferent airports packed the same way?
0.5;Because the employees at Haneda happened \Nto pack it the same way I did.
0.5;the president was double-checking \Nthe packaging.
0.5;What about the drivers who had transported \Nthe painting to the checkpoint?
0.5;President Shimamura was \Nchecking the packaging alone.
0.5;I thought it was strange when I heard \Nyou switched drivers at the checkpoint.
0.5;It's in the area where \Nwe lost our connection.
0.5;"it's possible the vehicle transporting \N""Scream"" drove off course within that area."
0.5;That's why I lost sight of the \Ncar while I was following behind!
0.5;If they drove off course there, they \Nwouldn't have reached the checkpoint.

0.5;Also, if you look closely \Nat the hardened candles,
0.5;on the cover of the magazine \Nnext to the laptop.
0.5;Which means that person \Nis one of you three
0.5;Earlier you said you were sleeping \Ninside your tent with earplugs in.
0.5;Since my tent was right next \Nto the tent that burned,
0.5;I remembered the faces and order \Nof the people who came this way.

0.5;When the countdown reaches zero, use your \Ndetective skills to produce an answer!
0.5;In any case, let's get to \Nthe bottom of the fire!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;By the time I visited Urushibara-kun's \Ntent, he was already hammered.
0.5;"No matter what I said, he just \Nshouted, ""Shut up, go away!"" at me."
0.5;and he said he was going to read \Ncomics before going to sleep.
0.5;But why'd he have so many \Ncandles inside his tent?
0.5;Was it also Urushibara-san's job \Nto bring all those comic books?
0.5;Urushibara-kun said he wanted \Nto read them while camping.
0.5;I should've made him eat curry \Nwith us instead of reading comics.
0.5;he didn't respond no matter how \Nmany times I called out to him.
0.5;I thought he must've gotten \Ndrunk and fallen asleep.
0.5;He never wakes up once he \Npasses out from drinking.
0.5;It's so bad, people would draw things \Non his face during training camps.
0.5;He said he always did squats \Nbefore going to bed.
0.5;then that would mean the \Nvictim was still awake then.
0.5;Which means the last person \Nto visit the victim's tent...
0.5;When I went to his tent to lure \Nhim out with the smell of curry,
0.5;I tried to talk to him, but he \Njust silently did his squats.
0.5;I thought he was doing them while using \Nheadphones to listen to music or something.
0.5;Now that I think about it, \Nmaybe he did hear me.
0.5;His squatting movements \Ngot more and more intense.
0.5;Why did the victim Urushibara-san \Nstay in his tent
0.5;Well, during basketball \Npractice, his elbow...
0.5;Danno-san claimed he used to be \Nthe ace of the basketball team.
0.5;If not for the injury he suffered to \Nhis right eye at Urushibara's hands,
0.5;he may have ended up \Nplaying for a foreign team.
0.5;he started spending more time \Nwith our manager Furuoka-san,
0.5;but the moment he became a manager, \Nevery last one of them left.
0.5;It's about the tape on the \Nvictim's fingers you asked about.
0.5;but most of the adhesive side \Nsurvived, so we removed it.
0.5;We're not the ones who set \Nfire to Urushibara's tent.
0.5;We did visit his tent one at \Na time before it caught fire,
0.5;We know Urushibara was inside since we saw \Nhis shadow doing squats on the tent wall,
0.5;but we couldn't have set the tent on fire \Nfrom the inside unless we'd gone inside.
0.5;was zipped all the way \Ndown and locked, right?
0.5;But what if those candles could be used \Nto create an automatic ignition device?
0.5;I think he would've noticed immediately \Nif there were something like that.
0.5;By that time Urushibara-san was \Nprobably already drunk and asleep.
0.5;stick a bamboo skewer \Ninto the end of a candle.
0.5;Sandwich the skewer between them \Nso they make a straight line.
0.5;Next, since we poked holes in the tops \Nof candles set on top of the books,
0.5;if you stick both ends of \Nthe skewer into the holes...
0.5;Now set fire to both ends of \Nthe stuck together candles.
0.5;The side that burns faster \Nwill become lighter and rise.
0.5;The side that falls will be exposed to a \Nlot of flame, making it drip more wax.
0.5;It seesaws back and forth \Nlike the balancing acorns.
0.5;If you use books to block \Nthe flame on one side,
0.5;only one flame can be \Nseen rising and falling.
0.5;Our shadows on the tent are \Nrising and falling, too.
0.5;By linking the victim's \Nhands behind his head,
0.5;and placing a large bag against \Nthe tent to cover his lower body,
0.5;they used the rising and falling flame to \Nmake his shadow look like he was doing squats.
0.5;the strange V shaped burn \Non the magazine was created
0.5;because it was placed on top of the \Nlaptop in order to block the light
0.5;and only the inside was exposed to \Nthe flame when it first caught fire.
0.5;The culprit probably scattered them \Nnext to the contraption beforehand,
0.5;As time goes on, the movements of \Nthe contraption become more intense.
0.5;If you set some flammable \Nclothes on the floor...
0.5;Furuoka Midori-san, who claimed the \Nlight was out so the victim could sleep
0.5;and Danno Kuninori-san, who visited the \Ntent after the victim started doing squats,
0.5;Which means the man claiming the lights \Nwere out when he visited the tent,
0.5;saw that the victim had turned on \Nthe lights and begun doing squats...
0.5;Urushibara's tent was zipped all \Nthe way shut and locked, right?
0.5;Most likely it happened while \Nthe victim was passed out,
0.5;you made a cut in the \Ntent with a sharp object,
0.5;Once the tent burned, the cut \Nwould disappear along with it.
0.5;No, this mud got on me \Nwhen I tripped earlier.
0.5;Then why did you remove the \Ntape from your right hand?
0.5;We saw it when he was \Nholding the curry ladle.
0.5;I believe Urushibara had some on his \Nright pointer and middle fingers, too.
0.5;But Urushibara-san's charred corpse \Nhad tape on both hands, which means...
0.5;to keep the passed out Urushibara-san's \Nhands linked behind his head.
0.5;then we might find on the adhesive surface \Nof the tape on the body's left hand
0.5;If you haven't thrown away the \Nknife you used to cut the tent,
0.5;the fibers from the victim's \Ntent should be on that, too.
0.5;I'm the one who set fire \Nto Urushibara's tent!
0.5;I'm the one who asked \NUrushibara to hurt Danno
0.5;I wasn't expecting it to \Nbe a career-ending injury,
0.5;Fortunately, everything I needed \Nfor it was inside his tent.
0.5;Hurry up and use your tranquilizer\Nwatch and soccer ball.
0.5;Just like you used that box \Ncutter to slice the tent.
0.5;If we let a child get \Nstabbed before our eyes,
0.5;the managing officer and I \Nwould've been worse than fired.
0.5;I couldn't hear what you said \Nto distract him, though.
0.5;The suspect's face just before he was \Narrested by Managing Officer Kuroda.
0.5;Maybe he was overcome by the spirit of \Na teacher looking out for her student.
0.5;about how much trouble you caused me \Nwhen you worked under me in investigations.
0.5;Maehama Ryuji was threatening\NTenyama Hide-san in Sasago-cho.
0.5;At this rate, we're going\Nto have to drop the charges,
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Job Request From Inspector Megure"""
0.5;As times change,\Ndifficult cases increase in number!
0.5;Let's review the double-murder\Nduring the intro song!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;We were invited to\NYotsui Reika's birthday party.
0.5;Someone punctured\Neveryone's tires,
0.5;forcing us all to wait\Nin the lodge until morning.
0.5;That night, while searching\Nfor the missing Reika,
0.5;Nikaido was drowned\Nin the fountain.
0.5;Ran was similarly attacked,\Nbut managed to survive.
0.5;Judging from the\Nkiller's power outage trick,
0.5;it was definitely\Nsomeone in the mansion!
0.5;Just then, Reika was\Nfound drowned to death
0.5;"""The Wealthy Daughter\NMurder Case (Part 2)."""
0.5;I can't say anything\Nwithout examining
0.5;but her head was probably\Nheld underwater.
0.5;Which means that\NNikaido-san's drowning,
0.5;Ran's near-drowning\Nin the kitchen sink,
0.5;and this murder were all\Ndone the exact same way.
0.5;Most likely. And the\Nkiller is rather cruel, too.
0.5;Look. Even her skirt\Nand socks are sopping wet--
0.5;There are also\Nrope marks on her wrists
0.5;It would seem\Nshe was kept somewhere
0.5;Who would do\Nsomething this terrible?
0.5;Say, you three went to\Nthe bathroom just now, right?
0.5;Did you see or hear\Nanything out of the ordinary?
0.5;They waited outside\Nwhile I was in the bathroom,
0.5;but there wasn't\Nanything strange.
0.5;Before he went in last,\Nlchieda-san told us to make coffee,
0.5;That's how you got\Nyour chance to kill her.
0.5;It takes at least five to six\Nminutes to make coffee.
0.5;That's all the time\Nyou'd need to take her
0.5;She's been dead for\Nat least an hour or two.
0.5;Meaning she was killed\Nbetween 5:00 and 6:00.
0.5;"The same goes for\NGojo-san and Yone-san;"
0.5;the three of them were with me\Nbetween 4:00 and 7:00.
0.5;This narrows down\Nthe list of suspects
0.5;to Mifune-san and Rokuda-san,\Nwho were in their rooms!
0.5;Then it's simple.\NRokuda's the killer
0.5;At around 6:00 am, you left\Nyour room and went somewhere.
0.5;The upstairs washroom is\Nright next to the stairs.
0.5;You could've killed\Nher on your way there.
0.5;Yes, I could have.\NThere's no one to vouch for me.
0.5;I never saw you\Nwhile I was up there!
0.5;If you could kindly tell me\Nwhat you were doing then...
0.5;She definitely died\Nbetween 5:00 and 6:00 am.
0.5;Which means those two\Nare the most suspicious.
0.5;Even if she did\Nfight back, this is too--
0.5;The killer used\Nboth rope and tape?!
0.5;Rokuda-san.\NYou didn't leave your room at all?
0.5;And you only left the\None time to wash your face?
0.5;Doesn't it seem strange?\NWe searched the whole place!
0.5;Was she outside?\NMaybe in the forest?!
0.5;Looks like one\Nof you is the lunatic
0.5;who's enjoying\Nthese random murders.
0.5;Why did the culprit\Nwait to kill Reika-san
0.5;And it bothers me\Nthat she was killed in here.
0.5;Why didn't the culprit\Nkill her at the fountain
0.5;In which case,\Nher unnecessarily wet clothes,
0.5;the tape marks,\Nthe reason Ran was attacked,
0.5;and the reason Reika-san's\Ndiscovery was delayed
0.5;But there's no proof\Nthat he's the killer!
0.5;Idiot! You wanna\Nget wet that badly?!
0.5;For now, let's all\Nmove to the living room
0.5;He says it'll help\Ndetermine who the killer is.
0.5;Now you can\Nfigure out who it is, right?!
0.5;The one who drowned\NNikaido-san in the fountain,
0.5;drugged and attempted\Nto drown Ran in the kitchen,
0.5;Before Nikaido-san was\Nmurdered in the first incident,
0.5;we went into the forest\Nto look for Reika-san.
0.5;In the forest, you decided\Nto split up and look for her.
0.5;He probably said\Nhe saw Reika-san by it.
0.5;Then he attacked\NNikaido-san from behind
0.5;Rokuda-san could've done\Nthe same thing!
0.5;Besides, why would\NI attack Ran-san?
0.5;And I was with you\Nwhen the killer cut the lights
0.5;How could I have\Nshut the power off?
0.5;Don't tell me\NI had an accomplice...
0.5;No, you can shut\Nit off easily enough
0.5;by using the air conditioners\Nand microwave ovens!
0.5;You set the timers on all the\Nair conditioners to the same time,
0.5;When the time comes,\Nthere's a power overload,
0.5;and Conan heard something\Nodd after the power failure.
0.5;The microwave was\Nwarm when I touched it later,
0.5;You then broke\Nthe window to make it
0.5;You then carried\NRan into the kitchen
0.5;You had drugged her\Ncoffee so she wouldn't fight back.
0.5;you were in the kitchen with me,\Nlooking for Reika-san.
0.5;You could have easily\Nturned the microwaves on
0.5;Have you forgotten\Nthat I have an alibi?
0.5;I was with you when\NReika-sama was killed!
0.5;If I'm supposedly\Nbehind all three incidents,
0.5;then please explain\Nhow I killed her.
0.5;Reika-sama died\Nbetween 5:00 and 6:00.
0.5;He was with us the\Nentire time from 4:00 to 7:00.
0.5;And the sleeping\Npills in Ran-san's drink...
0.5;Could he really have\Nplanned it in advance?
0.5;What if he wound up\Nwith the drugged coffee?
0.5;So we might've\Nbeen attacked too?!
0.5;If you were unlucky\Nenough to drink that coffee.
0.5;you would've wound\Nup just like Ran.
0.5;That's right. It wasn't someone's\Nlife you wanted then...
0.5;You wanted someone to\Nsay that their head
0.5;drowned the people in\Nall three incidents!
0.5;Her head just\Nwasn't held underwater.
0.5;But she was killed\Nbetween 5:00 and 6:00 am.
0.5;For some reason, the culprit\Nwaited seven or eight hours
0.5;And for some reason,\Nthe killer used tape
0.5;Normally, you fill a\Nbathtub using the faucet.
0.5;water came out\Nof the shower instead.
0.5;It was because\Nthe killer used the shower
0.5;Ichieda-san probably\Ndrugged Reika-san
0.5;carried her in here,\Nand used said trick.
0.5;He adjusted the shower\Nso that she would drown
0.5;He stayed with us\Nbetween 5:00 and 6:00,
0.5;then pretended to\Nuse the bathroom at 7:00
0.5;This crude trick\Nwould've seemed obvious
0.5;look like Reika-san's head\Nwas held underwater too.
0.5;But there was a chance\Nthat she might be discovered
0.5;He burned out the\Nlight bulbs here in advance
0.5;to keep people away,\Nbut it'd be all over
0.5;But he overcame this problem\Nby checking the tub himself.
0.5;Only you could've\Ndone this, Ichieda-san!
0.5;You make some big claims,\Nyet you have no proof...
0.5;It wasn't your coat\Nthat I wanted to see--
0.5;it was the water\Nblotches on your shirt!
0.5;So what are those\Nblotches on your arms?
0.5;You got them washing\Nyour hands? I think not.
0.5;You can't get blotches\Nthere with your coat on!
0.5;to keep it from\Ngetting wet when you pulled
0.5;Your elbows are wet because\Nyou rolled your sleeves up.
0.5;From the fact that\Nthese were all drownings,
0.5;who drowned in the\Naccident two years ago...
0.5;Yaeko took a lifeboat to\Nthe island to rescue Reika.
0.5;But she was shocked\Nwhen she arrived--
0.5;wasn't wearing a vest\Nwhen we found her body
0.5;and that they both\Nsaid they hadn't seen her.
0.5;But how do we know\Nthat's really what happened?
0.5;They fessed up\Nright before I killed them.
0.5;but one person's death\Nis another person's sadness.
0.5;I don't remember much\Nbecause of the sleeping pills,
0.5;No. It was actually\NConan-kun who saved me...
0.5;But it couldn't have\Nbeen that mystery nerd!
0.5;Yeah! He'd never be\Nthat thoughtful!
0.5;The championship\Nflag was shredded up?!
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na glittering shooting star!
0.5;Conan's logic is good medicine\Nfor hearts dried by modern society!
0.5;Today's case is a bank robbery!\NBut something's a little off!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;Bowling alleys are nice\Nand empty on weekdays!
0.5;And it feels great to\Nbe done with midterms!
0.5;Yeah, Dad asked me to\Ncash a check a client wrote him!
0.5;This shouldn't take too long,\NConan-kun.
0.5;Looks like the cold's\Nreally going around.
0.5;The daughter of the\NSuzuki family shows herself!
0.5;Branch Manager. I'm going\Nto make my rounds now.
0.5;Everyone,\Nstand up with your hands up!
0.5;Okay! Do anything\Nfunny and you're dead!
0.5;Maejima-san's bullet wound\Nwas serious, but not life-threatening.
0.5;So, when Maejima-san went to\Nhit the robber with the wooden sword,
0.5;That's right. Then the robber\Nturned around, saw him, and fired!
0.5;And immediately after, you jumped\Non the robber, Taniguchi-san?
0.5;The robber did too, so he\Npointed the gun at the women...
0.5;My only focus was on\Npointing the gun elsewhere...
0.5;And this corner wasn't\Nrecorded by the security camera.
0.5;Actually, Maejima-san\Nwas injured during an incident.
0.5;Pardon my asking, but did\Nyou call this phone at around 3:05?
0.5;Not so loud! I'm gonna sell\Nthis to the media later for a lot!
0.5;Don't move!\NStay right where you are!
0.5;We have some idea\Nabout the situation now.
0.5;Will Taniguchi be\Nblamed for what he did?
0.5;Had he not jumped at the robber,\Nyou folks might've been shot!
0.5;He acted courageously\Nand risked his own life!
0.5;Is that so?!\NThat's great news, Taniguchi!
0.5;This isn't a toy, little boy.\NIt's important.
0.5;Taniguchi-san. \NI'll be filing the report,
0.5;so could you accompany\Nme to the station?
0.5;Why did Taniguchi-san\Nget nervous and hide his phone?
0.5;Could there be\Nanother side to this case?!
0.5;So, this case does\Nhave a more sinister side!
0.5;The old man's not here today,\Nso I'll have to rely on Sonoko again!
0.5;I'm sorry to burden\Nyou after all that's happened...
0.5;There's a sinister\Nside to this thingy, err, dealy!
0.5;To begin with, what rang when\NMaejima-san went to use the sword
0.5;Impossible! Everyone's confirmed\Nthat it was his phone that rang!
0.5;both you and Taniguchi-san\Nmistakenly grabbed your own phones!
0.5;Similarly, everyone thought it\Nwas Maejima-san's phone that rang!
0.5;That is possible, but how are you\Nsure it was the robber's phone instead?
0.5;Compare the ringtones of\Nthe two phones and you'll see.
0.5;Also, that college guy has the\Nringtone from the robbery on tape!
0.5;I mean, don't bother lying!\NI know you do!
0.5;It's the same sound,\Nbut a different pattern...
0.5;And here's the one\Nduring the incident...
0.5;Did someone just happen\Nto call his phone then, or--
0.5;That accomplice saw Maejima-san\Nabout to hit him with the sword,
0.5;and quickly called the\Nrobber's phone using his own...
0.5;What?! Then that means\Nhis accomplice is still in here!
0.5;You can't be serious.\NDon't joke like that.
0.5;First, you used your cell phone\Nto signal the robber outside
0.5;Because the staff door opens\Nfrom the inside when someone leaves,
0.5;but you need a card\Nto get in from the outside!
0.5;Branch Manager. I'm going\Nto make my rounds now.
0.5;Everyone stand\Nup with your hands up!
0.5;Then, as planned, you filled\Nthe bag with cash as he ordered,
0.5;and were the only\None left behind the counter.
0.5;Looking back, he barely\Nseemed concerned about you!
0.5;Your original plan had him\Nleaving without hurting anyone
0.5;and making off\Nwith the money-filled bag!
0.5;Then, you'd meet up with\Nhim later to split the money!
0.5;The robber's phone rang,\Nbut Maejima-san thought it was his own
0.5;The biggest mistake, in your eyes,\Nwas when he shot him.
0.5;The robber lost his cool and\Nlooked ready to shoot other people.
0.5;Realizing that the plan was\Nout of control, you jumped at him...
0.5;...and shut him up by pretending\Nto shoot him during the struggle!
0.5;This is nonsense!\NShe's just making this up!
0.5;If she's right, the redial button\Nshould call the robber's phone.
0.5;You erased your redial memory\Nwhen you went to the restroom!
0.5;Inspector. There's definitive\Nproof that they were accomplices.
0.5;Cough drops! I got them from\NTaniguchi-san before the robbery!
0.5;Inspector. In your right hand\Nis paper the robber threw away.
0.5;He and Taniguchi-san probably\Nmet somewhere this afternoon
0.5;so one of them split a pack of\Ncough drops and gave half to the other.
0.5;Afterwards, the robber's throat\Nhurt again after shouting
0.5;so, he went to get a cough drop from\Nhis pocket, but they were all gone
0.5;Then, he remembered Taniguchi-san\Nhad some in his jacket pocket
0.5;...unaware he had given\Nthem away to Conan-kun.
0.5;As proof, the tears on the\Nwrappers should fit perfectly!
0.5;Also, fingerprints from Taniguchi-san\Nor the robber should be on both!
0.5;Taniguchi-san.\NDo you have anything to say?
0.5;You're incredible, Sonoko!\NYou solved another case!
0.5;It's all about the cute and charming\Nhigh school detective Suzuki Sonoko!
0.5;Darn it! I knew\NI shouldn't have used her!
0.5;As times change, difficult\Ncases increase in number!
0.5;He sees the truth\Nin people's hearts,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;I was hoping you\Ncould find the address
0.5;of a man named\NKitagawa Tsuyoshi-san.
0.5;I met him in early June,\Nduring a trip to Shinshu...
0.5;I didn't think much\Nof him at the time,
0.5;Oh, I get it!\NYou've fallen in love with him!
0.5;Just a simple search.\NNo need for me here.
0.5;Oh! He's quite\Nthe unique individual!
0.5;to get his address from\Nthe transportation office!
0.5;They say that when\Nyou draw someone's picture,
0.5;your feelings for\Nthat person go into it.
0.5;Go do your homework\Nand mind your own business!
0.5;Conan-kun. You shouldn't\Nget in the way of--
0.5;Let's see. 3-9-8...\NSumire Lodge...
0.5;Thanks for bringing\Nme my handkerchief!
0.5;I got sick.\NI'm recuperating now.
0.5;Now, now. Is a girl's\Napartment that rare for you?
0.5;So now I'm looking\Nfor a new boyfriend.
0.5;That man in the sketch\Nsure seems different, though.
0.5;I'm thinking things might go smoother\Nwith a different type of person!
0.5;That's enough about me.\NTell me about yourself.
0.5;Oh, well. I guess I'll\Nwait around for the old man.
0.5;But will he really\Nfind him that easily?
0.5;I haven't been\Nto the aquarium in forever!
0.5;Me neither! I hope\NI can pet the dolphins!
0.5;without giving his new address\Nto the transportation office.
0.5;I thought it was strange\Nshe hired a detective
0.5;when she already had\Nhis license plate number...
0.5;Sorry! I just remembered\NI hafta do something!
0.5;I wonder whose grave it is.\NIt still looks new.
0.5;No, all I did was help\Nwith your rehabilitation.
0.5;What do you say we\Nhave coffee somewhere?
0.5;I figured it was that\Nlady's boyfriend's grave.
0.5;It is. He was both\Nmy friend and her fiancé.
0.5;No doubt about it!\NIt was the guy in the picture!
0.5;Noriko-san lied\Nabout being dumped
0.5;when her boyfriend\Nwas actually dead...
0.5;The two were driving\Nthrough scenic Shinshu
0.5;Pardon my asking,\Nbut how are you two related?
0.5;I met him in early June,\Nduring a trip to Shinshu...
0.5;Did she meet him when her\Nfiancé caused the accident?!
0.5;Have you ever heard\Nthe name Kitagawa Tsuyoshi?
0.5;Tell me! It has\Nto do with that lady!
0.5;With Noriko-san?!\NWho exactly are you?
0.5;To think that the famous Detective\NMori would have an assistant like you.
0.5;It was the only\Nway to get you to talk.
0.5;I can't give any details,\Nbut could you start
0.5;by giving me the name\Nof Noriko-san's fiance?
0.5;He worked at the same\Ncompany as she did.
0.5;Earlier, you seemed surprised\Nwhen I mentioned a red sports car.
0.5;I heard her talking to\Nthe police after the accident...
0.5;Yes. There was a young\Ncouple in it, chasing us.
0.5;At first they kept honking\Ntheir horn from behind,
0.5;Alright. We're looking\Ninto the incident,
0.5;but even if we do catch them,\Nthey'll probably get off easy.
0.5;Things might've been different\Nhad you actually collided,
0.5;Do you remember the car's\Nmodel or license plate number?
0.5;"Then she answered clearly with,\N""I don't remember."""
0.5;She couldn't describe\Nthe couple very well either,
0.5;and with no other leads, the police\Ninvestigation ended after only a month.
0.5;Oh! He's quite\Nthe unique individual!
0.5;Noriko-san remembered\Nhis plate number and his face!
0.5;Does the fact that\Nshe didn't tell the police
0.5;mean that she's going to\Ntake matters into her own hands?!
0.5;Saeki-san! What was the rehabilitation\Nyou and Noriko-san talked about?!
0.5;I was the doctor in\Ncharge of her rehabilitation.
0.5;What normally takes half a year,\Nshe did in three months.
0.5;Her lust for revenge inspired\Nher to get better quickly!
0.5;Saeki-san! Let's go\Nsee Noriko-san right now!
0.5;I have to somehow change\NNoriko-san's feelings
0.5;before the old man\Nfinds this Kitagawa guy!
0.5;It must've gotten\Nthere when I recently
0.5;A Shakoba Cactus?\NWas it Yamaguchi-san's?!
0.5;He had raised cactuses\Nsince he was a kid.
0.5;I took all of them\Nin after the accident,
0.5;I'd like to share\Nthem with Noriko-san,
0.5;but that would\Nonly remind her of him...
0.5;Wait! Shakoba Cactuses are\Nalso known as Christmas Cactuses!
0.5;No, it's on the way\Nto Noriko-san's place.
0.5;That's odd. There's no telling\Nwhen the old man will contact her,
0.5;Don't tell me he's\Nalready found the address?!
0.5;Did you find out\Nthe guy's address already?
0.5;Yep, sure did!\NWasn't easy, either!
0.5;I wore the\Nbottoms off of my shoes!
0.5;I just got off\Nthe phone with her.
0.5;But the guy's already\Nliving with some chick,
0.5;Noriko-san probably went\Nto the transportation office
0.5;on her own to find\NKitagawa's address.
0.5;Unable to find his new address,\Nshe hired the old man!
0.5;How is she planning\Nto get revenge, anyway?!
0.5;The car's gasoline ignited\Nbefore he could be pulled out...
0.5;Aha! That wasn't\Nkerosene at all!
0.5;"I don't need your excuses;\Nyou're both going to die now."
0.5;You two are human scum!\NGet ready to die!
0.5;You're going to suffer\Nexactly like my boyfriend did!
0.5;Noriko-san!\NStop this foolishness!
0.5;Doing this won't bring\NYamaguchi-san back!
0.5;I know that!\NBut this is all I can do!
0.5;Don't do it! Light it on fire\Nand you'll be injured too!
0.5;I have no future now\Nthat Tatsuo-san is gone!
0.5;They bloom in the winter,\Nso in some countries
0.5;and even referred to\Nas Christmas Cactuses!
0.5;Yes. I took in all of his\Ncactuses as mementos.
0.5;but he lives on in\Neach one of these flowers.
0.5;You should've come!\NThe aquarium was awesome!
0.5;The aquarium guy took\Na picture at that exact moment!
0.5;Abe took out an insurance\Npolicy on Negishi-san
0.5;And he had me\Nvouch for his alibi!
0.5;I'll smash in that\Nrotten head of yours!
0.5;"""The Akaoni Fire\NFestival Murder Case."""
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;According to his secretary \NShinkai Haruyuki-san,
0.5;Takarada was renting this room \Nso he could write a novel.
0.5;Now that you mention it, I heard he \Nself-published books in his spare time.
0.5;He'd been in here since \Nthis morning by himself.
0.5;Even though we'd never met before, \Nhe suddenly called before noon.
0.5;When the letter arrived at the mansion \Nthis morning, that's what I thought, too.
0.5;We'll be asking you about the \Ndamage you did to the body later.
0.5;Right now, the murder is \Nthe more pressing matter.
0.5;by striking him on the back of \Nthe head with a blunt object,
0.5;they strangled him with some \Nkind of rope-like object.
0.5;He says he saw a suspicious \Nwoman right around that time.
0.5;After lunch, I came to this \Nfloor while doing my rounds.
0.5;a blonde I didn't recognize came \Nwalking away from this room.
0.5;and exited through the front \Nbecause she'd been seen.
0.5;Now that you mention it, he had \Na habit of using the chain lock.
0.5;If he was so worried about the \Nletter that he called a detective,
0.5;he wouldn't have let any strange \Npeople into his room, right?
0.5;We haven't forgotten that \Nit could be someone he knew.
0.5;His family have finished \Nidentifying the body.
0.5;Ma'am, where were you around \N1 PM this afternoon?
0.5;You'll be inheriting his fortune \Nand the insurance money.
0.5;I was at home organizing the \Nstorehouse like Takarada asked.
0.5;Don't you think it's weird \Nto assume family did it?
0.5;Excuse me, but could we continue \Nthis discussion at home?
0.5;Takagi-kun, could you \Ninvestigate the other case?
0.5;Naturally, I was aware of President \NTakarada's unscrupulous practices.
0.5;his victims were fools for allowing \Nthemselves to be preyed upon.
0.5;must've been a victim like the \None who killed their own child.
0.5;But why did you decide to \Nkill Takarada yourself?
0.5;As long as he was around, \Nmore victims would've been born!
0.5;I thought it would be a way \Nto atone for helping him!
0.5;But the killer isn't necessarily \None of Takarada's victims.
0.5;Detective, do you really think \Nsomeone in his family did it?
0.5;Two years ago, after failing \Nin one of his attempts,
0.5;he came crying to Takarada to \Nbail him out of the situation,
0.5;But three days ago, he asked \Nus to take him in for a while.
0.5;It seems it's true that a \Nlot of people hated him.
0.5;Then he must've received a \Nlot of threatening letters.
0.5;Takarada-san received threatening \Nletters all the time.
0.5;His housekeeper said he was even \Nattacked with a knife once.
0.5;He even laughed it off \Nin front of everyone else
0.5;That's why he laughed it off so \Nthey would let their guard down.
0.5;Then he was going to hire me \Nto investigate and expose them.
0.5;but also one of the three people \Nwho were there at the time.
0.5;without realizing Takarada had \Nalready been strangled, he's out.
0.5;Call my lawyer Watari-sensei \Nand have him come here.
0.5;And tell Beika Health I need \Nto discuss the insurance claim.
0.5;Now that we know this man \Ndid it, the case is settled.
0.5;I can finally say I only married \NTakarada for his money.
0.5;In any case, Koji-san, you \Nsent Takarada-san that letter
0.5;Koji-san seemed to be waiting \Nfor someone on the roof
0.5;of an apartment building at \Na hero show for families.
0.5;I watched him the whole \Ntime, but no one came.
0.5;The housekeeper should be able to \Nverify the wife's story, anyway.
0.5;Shinkai-san was actually able \Nto verify Koji-san's alibi,
0.5;They used a piece of paper that \Nhad his fingerprints on them.
0.5;So the real killer could make \Nit look like he'd done it.
0.5;Killing my brother wouldn't \Nbenefit me in any way.
0.5;Takarada had terminal cancer \Nand only six months to live.
0.5;before I'd get his fortune \Nand insurance money.
0.5;What kind of idiot would do something \Nstupid to risk losing it all?
0.5;So after you came back \Nfrom relieving yourself,
0.5;Maybe they thought it was \Na garbage collection site,
0.5;matched the hair we took \Nfrom the wig that was found.
0.5;There must've been some reason \Nyou couldn't wait six months.
0.5;Maybe, but that wig had \Nbeen thrown away, right?
0.5;There are much more certain\Nways of getting rid of something,
0.5;You've been waiting for your chance \Nto kill my brother, haven't you?
0.5;The woman who had remained married \Nto Takarada for his money
0.5;Using a sheet of paper with \NKoji-san's fingerprints on it,
0.5;Then she visited the rented \Nroom and strangled Takarada.
0.5;She fled while wearing \Nthe disguise she prepared
0.5;in case anyone saw her and \Ndisposed of it when she was done.
0.5;Yeah, you're the only one I \Ncan ask about legal stuff.
0.5;If a wife murders her husband, she \Ncan't inherit his fortune, right?
0.5;The head of the household \Nonly has one younger brother.
0.5;Killing my brother wouldn't \Nbenefit me in any way.
0.5;But if he sets up his brother's \Nwife and his killer,
0.5;that she wouldn't have anyone \Nto verify her alibi today.
0.5;If you'd just kept up the lie \Nand backed up my story!
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “The \NMan Who Died Twice, Part Two!”
0.5;Curious, the old man and I decided \Nto follow Ran on her outing.
0.5;where they began discussing \Nsome kind of trip.
0.5;She's just incidentally meeting \NOkita on her trip to Kyoto.
0.5;Maybe we'll incidentally \Nrun into Shinichi-kun, too.
0.5;While this was happening, we heard \Na scream from the back of the café,
0.5;where the body of waiter Saraie \NDaiki-san was discovered.
0.5;Which means the culprit may \Nhave been after its contents.
0.5;I'm not sure. Only its \Nowner would know for sure.
0.5;He's been using it since \Nhe started working here.
0.5;Inscribing love and cases \Nwith deductive reasoning!
0.5;the girl's trip to Kyoto \Nhas captured my interest!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""The High School Girl Trio's \NSecret Café, Part Two!"""
0.5;I see pliers, a hammer, \Nscrewdrivers, and a spanner.
0.5;None of those could break \Na padlock like that.
0.5;The only other thing in here \Nare these screws and nails.
0.5;Something Saraie-san kept \Ncarefully locked in his locker.
0.5;"That man wrote a food blog under \Nthe handle ""the Stuffed Professor."""
0.5;He made lots of posts \Ndisparaging rival restaurants.
0.5;It's pretty popular for \Nits funny writing, right?
0.5;My restaurant is hard \Nup because of that blog.
0.5;from telling him the address of \NPoirot and its delicious sandwiches.
0.5;Why do you and the manager have different \Nfamily names when you're siblings?
0.5;My brother's father-in-law was \Napparently a stubborn man.
0.5;He said he wouldn't let him \Nmarry his only daughter
0.5;unless he took his name and \Ntook over the restaurant.
0.5;Isuzu-chan, since your family started \Nits own branch of the restaurant,
0.5;have they not been victimized \Nby that man's blog?
0.5;Are you sure that business isn't \Ngoing under because of his blog,
0.5;Then I would've complained to \Nhim like Motosu-san instead!
0.5;I had no idea Saraie-kun was \Nrunning that kind of blog.
0.5;he was threatening to show embarrassing \Nphotos of you from when you two dated...
0.5;If he was causing mischief with his \Nblog, then it's all the more likely.
0.5;He was going to become the new manager \Nafter I got married and quit my job.
0.5;I wouldn't have to worry about \Nmoney if I became his girlfriend.
0.5;You can fake that easily by \Nwrapping yourself in bandages,
0.5;and make it seem like it \Nwas dislocated all along.
0.5;Conan-kun seems to be \Nthinking about the case.
0.5;Oh, I figured that out when \Nwe entered the changing room.
0.5;She said it's an unusual trip \NI'd experience when I'm older.
0.5;You're saying this murder was \Ncommitted by an outsider, Inspector?
0.5;had his own restaurant harshly \Ncriticized on the victim's blog.
0.5;The waitress Naomura Isuzu-san \Nwas being harassed by the victim.
0.5;The manager Hasunuma Tamao-san \Nis getting married next month,
0.5;and it's possible her ex-boyfriend, \Nthe victim, was threatening her.
0.5;But when the nearly 30 kilo vase that is \Nthe murder weapon is filled with water,
0.5;that could be used to break the \Npadlock on the victim's locker.
0.5;no one else could have \Nbrought the vase back here.
0.5;This window was open when \NSaraie-san's body was discovered.
0.5;then someone could have entered through the \Nwindow at night and carried the vase here.
0.5;An incredibly strong someone who \Ncould swing a water-filled vase
0.5;I'll show you how to break a padlock \Nwith hardly any force at all,
0.5;There was a toolbox inside \Nthose drawers, right?
0.5;And inside there are two spanners \Njust like these, right?
0.5;If you jam both spanners \Ninto the U-shaped spanner
0.5;of the locked padlock and apply \Nyour weight from above...
0.5;that would indicate the padlock \Nwas broken using spanners.
0.5;the culprit took the key from his body, \Nunlocked and removed the padlock,
0.5;so it looked like the culprit was after \Nthe contents of Saraie-san's locker.
0.5;Could you get that spanner \Nfrom underneath the drawers?
0.5;They forcefully dropped the vase on \Ntop of the victim's head like this.
0.5;They asked the victim to get something \Nfrom underneath the drawers
0.5;so they could kill him by simply lifting \Nthe vase instead of swinging it.
0.5;they put the flowers they had in their \Nlocker in the vase, filled it with water,
0.5;and pushed the vase towards \Nthe blood splatter
0.5;You said you could wrap your \Nwrist in bandages later
0.5;to make it seem like it \Nwas dislocated all along.
0.5;You were wearing socks when you picked \Nup the pieces of the glass I broke.
0.5;Your shoes and pants are black, \Nso blood isn't visible on them,
0.5;You asked Saraie-san to use the vacuum to \Nsuck up the earring underneath the drawers
0.5;But if it was stuck there with glue, \Nit would've been difficult to get.
0.5;So while he was lying on the floor, \Nyou dropped the vase on him.
0.5;And she could stop the flowers from wilting \Nby putting them in the filled water bottles.
0.5;He criticized my family's \Nrestaurant on his blog as well.
0.5;Though it's gone now since \Nmy parents killed themselves
0.5;My father fell ill, so my \Nmother was cooking instead.
0.5;It's true that the quality \Nof our dishes had declined.
0.5;"""I'm the poster girl of a \Nrestaurant you ruined!"""
0.5;He claimed to be disappointed after dining \Nregularly at our restaurant for years.
0.5;He criticized us based only \Non rumors and our image!
0.5;"so I dropped a vase on the head of a man who \Ncalled himself ""the Stuffed Professor"""
0.5;Didn't you know the moment \Nwe entered the crime scene?
0.5;I thought he might have been doing \Nsomething while lying on the floor
0.5;Normally if a pearl earring \Nfell on the floor,
0.5;the post would be touching \Nthe floor due to its weight,
0.5;I spent all that time thinking about it, \Nbut I still don't understand your trip.
0.5;I doubt even Shinichi-kun \Nwould miss this trip.
0.5;But we saw him smoking \Ncigarettes. Right, Ran-neechan?
0.5;It's probably safe to assume \Nthere was no foul play.
0.5;It's become clear to me that this is a \Nmurder made to look like an accident.
0.5;As times change, difficult\Ncases increase in number!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Why am I stuck with\Nyou guys during Christmas?
0.5;What's his problem?!\NChristmas only comes once a year!
0.5;He's always arrogant,\Nsnobbish, and mean...
0.5;But maybe that's\Nwhat I like about him!
0.5;What about you?\NAre you seeing anyone?
0.5;You know, the guy\Nfrom Lex, that rock band!
0.5;Dad got me invited\Nto one of their parties!
0.5;You know you have\Na talk show after this!
0.5;Have you been doing\Nyour job as our drummer?
0.5;Thanks! I always\Nappreciate your business!
0.5;It's perfect for you--\Nyou did believe in Santa
0.5;Wouldn't you agree,\NMs. Snooty Manager?
0.5;Yeah. I'm leaving\Nwhen this tour's over.
0.5;Hey, that's my song!\NWho requested it?
0.5;Fine. I'll tell the\Nstudio we'll be late.
0.5;The first suspect was Sumii,\Nthe guy who brought the food.
0.5;He and Kimura Tatsuya\Nused to be bandmates.
0.5;But then Tatsuya went\Npro and became popular.
0.5;But he was cleared of\Nsuspicion when we learned
0.5;Toxins were found on the\Nvictim's clothes and microphone,
0.5;so he had touched the poison\Nbefore eating the rice ball.
0.5;Which means the killer\Nplaced poison on the microphone
0.5;which indirectly adhered\Nto him when he grabbed it.
0.5;That means it was done by\Nthe person who sang before him...
0.5;I hear you sang a\Nfarewell song while crying.
0.5;Did something\Nhappen between you two?
0.5;Tatsuya didn't dump me!\NHe turned me down!
0.5;Sorry, Mieko.\NI already like someone.
0.5;He said it couldn't\Nwork out between us!
0.5;Inspector. Tatsuya requested\Nthe song that she sang!
0.5;She had no idea that\Nhe would be singing next!
0.5;She couldn't have\Npoisoned the microphone!
0.5;Say, who requested\Nhis Bloody Venus song?
0.5;Did he always take\Nhis jacket off when he sang?
0.5;Only at the start of every\NBloody Venus.
0.5;Inspector! What part of his\Nclothing had cyanide on it?!
0.5;"The manager and Tatsuya-san\Nwere arguing earlier;"
0.5;Yeah. They argued\Nabout everything.
0.5;Said they were the\Nreason he wanted to quit...
0.5;But what a sad incident\Nthis is if it's true...
0.5;Cancel the investigation!\NGet everyone back there!
0.5;In other words, the person\Nwho had Tatsuya-san
0.5;was his manager,\NTerahara Mari-san!
0.5;I wasn't even in\Nthe room when he died.
0.5;You could've poisoned him\Ndespite your distance,
0.5;simply by having\Nhim sing this song.
0.5;"This was his hit song,\N""Bloody Venus""!"
0.5;Could you sing for us,\Nusing the mic I've prepared?
0.5;Wait! Why aren't you\Nremoving your jacket?
0.5;He always took his jacket off\Nwhen he sang this song.
0.5;She used to sing with\NTatsuya in my band.
0.5;Now try eating\Nthe food I've prepared.
0.5;I'd rather not. I touched him\Nafter he collapsed!
0.5;His hands and clothes\Nhad poison on them!
0.5;I could've gotten\Nsome on my hands too!
0.5;Then please check\Nher jacket, Inspector.
0.5;Same goes for the jacket!\NI put it on after touching Tatsuya!
0.5;If there is poison on it,\Nthat doesn't mean--
0.5;No. It's not poison\NI'm looking for.
0.5;In other words,\Nthat's not her jacket--
0.5;She wiped poison on the\Ninside of the left elbow
0.5;so that some of it would\Nget on his shirt underneath
0.5;All that remained was\Nto have him sing Bloody Venus.
0.5;During his dance,\Nhe throws the jacket off
0.5;Then he dies of poisoning\Nwhen he eats afterward.
0.5;Her motive is in the\Nphotograph on the table.
0.5;It's from when he was\Nin Sumii-san's band.
0.5;In the center of the picture,\Nwith Tatsuya-san.
0.5;That's right. That picture\Nof her is the very motive
0.5;That's right!\NI had plastic surgery!
0.5;So I got the surgery\Nto be worthy of him...
0.5;His attitude suddenly\Nchanged after I got it.
0.5;He even had me sing\Nthe Rudolph song earlier!
0.5;That's why he requested\Nthe song for you?
0.5;He made me his manager\Njust to insult me!
0.5;Tatsuya-san had been in love\Nwith you for quite some time.
0.5;Those were the\Nlyrics to his newest song.
0.5;The combination of a man\Nunable to express his feelings
0.5;and a woman who hid hers\Nbrought forth a sad ending...
0.5;That's what you get for\Nsaying Kudo Shinichi's name...
0.5;I wish I could help,\Nbut there's nothing I can do...
0.5;Where are you?\NSay something if you're there!
0.5;Wish you could see\Nyourself right now.
0.5;Still haven't finished that\Ncase. Later, Ran!
0.5;Next year will be interesting, \Ntoo. Hee hee hee.
0.5;But if someone finds out, \Nwe'll both be arrested.
0.5;Nah. Our alibis are perfect, and \NI'll be the one to finish her off.
0.5;He laughs, he cries, he sleeps, he \Nwakes up, and he dances beautifully!
0.5;I'm really sorry suddenly asking \Nyou to take some time off for us.
0.5;Sonoko-san, if you'd only asked, we would \Nhave set aside some limited products for you.
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;You knew from the start that \Nwe'd be carrying stuff.
0.5;Hold on. You can't suddenly \Nask for the day off.
0.5;But wouldn't trying hard on the commercial \Nget me an even better job than this one?
0.5;Ayaka-san, you're acting \Na little strange today.
0.5;She doesn't want to do this \Ntough low-paying job anymore.
0.5;Let's try to get along while we're \Nworking on this campaign, okay?
0.5;Yeah. It was worth standing \Nin line for thirty minutes.
0.5;This storage room within a shopping \Nmall where the crime took place
0.5;The victim Saijo Ayaka-san seems to have \Nfallen from the construction scaffolding.
0.5;There were signs that the scaffolding the \Nvictim fell from had been tampered with.
0.5;I see. Could you describe the circumstances \Nunder which you found her?
0.5;Then where were you around \N2:30PM when Ayaka-san died?
0.5;I was here preparing for the sale \Nthis afternoon along with the staff.
0.5;I was actually skipping work to watch \Nthe concert going on in the event space.
0.5;"""Dear Mai, sorry about \Nearlier. I got carried away."""
0.5;"""I'd like to apologize, so please come to \Nfloor 2, section 3 of the storage room around 3PM."""
0.5;Mai-san received a letter from Ayaka-san \Nsaying she wanted to apologize.
0.5;She secretly went to the storage \Nroom and broke the scaffolding.
0.5;Then she feigned innocence and met Ayaka-san \Non the second floor of the storage room.
0.5;Ran-neechan, doesn't this \Nseem the other way around?
0.5;Yeah. It was Ayaka-san who \Nasked Mai-san to come here.
0.5;But Mai-san is thought to have \Ntampered with the scaffolding.
0.5;That marks where Mai-san's \Nbrooch fell, right?
0.5;The belt around these boxes is \Nloose. They're about to fall over.
0.5;and the other stacks and \Nsecures them in place.
0.5;I told you, that brooch has been \Nmissing since a few days ago!
0.5;I heard you were the runner-up \Nat an audition for a commercial.
0.5;Yuko-chan was in the green \Nroom with me when it happened.
0.5;Nope. I haven't been there \Nonce this afternoon.
0.5;He was wondering if there was \Nanyone who could vouch for you.
0.5;I'm just feeling a little dizzy \Nbecause I figured it all out.
0.5;could you go up to the second floor \Nwhere Ayaka-san fell, Detective Takagi?
0.5;There were two tricks set \Nup inside this storage room.
0.5;The first was applied to the \Nscaffolding that made Ayaka-san fall.
0.5;Detective Takagi, could you look at the \Nclasp on the belt securing those boxes?
0.5;There's some kind of \Npaint or something on it.
0.5;based on what we just confirmed and \NMai-san's testimony relating to her brooch...
0.5;I told you, that brooch has been \Nmissing since a few days ago!
0.5;And in conjunction with the letter \NAyaka-san wrote to Mai-san...
0.5;Ayaka-san stole Mai-san's \Nbrooch and left it here.
0.5;and planned to send her and the scaffolding \Ncrashing to the floor by knocking over the boxes.
0.5;But something made her lose her footing \Non the scaffolding she tampered with
0.5;Boxes can't be stacked on the \Nsecond floor without two people.
0.5;One lifts the boxes using the crane, \Nwhile the other stacks them up.
0.5;An evil seal who incited Ayaka-san and \Ngot her caught up in this murder plot.
0.5;"""She's planning to injure you \Nand steal your commercial job."""
0.5;"""She did the same thing to me \Nbefore and took one of mine."""
0.5;"""At this rate, she'll continue to \Nescalate, and harm the two of us."""
0.5;Then the evil seal instructed \NAyaka-san to do the following.
0.5;"""Write a letter to Mai-san inviting \Nher to the storage room."""
0.5;"""Leave this brooch I stole from \Nher in front of the boxes."""
0.5;"""Once Mai-san comes to the second floor, \Nshe'll spot her brooch and approach."""
0.5;"""Then I'll push the boxes onto her \Nfrom behind, and she'll fall."""
0.5;"""During that time,\Nyou'll go fabricate an alibi."""
0.5;I see. But it was Ayaka-san, \Nnot Mai-san, who ended up dead.
0.5;It was the evil seal who \Ntampered with the scaffolding.
0.5;Ayaka-san climbed the scaffolding \Nwithout realizing that and fell.
0.5;The true goal of this murder \Nplot was to kill Ayaka-san.
0.5;This trick was bait meant \Nto draw in Ayaka-san.
0.5;If they had invited Ayaka-san here \Nwith the intention of murdering her,
0.5;or Ayaka-san herself could \Nhave told someone about it.
0.5;But by luring Ayaka-san into \Na fake plot to murder Mai-san,
0.5;they didn't have to worry \Nabout her telling anyone.
0.5;Furthermore, the odds that suspicion \Nwould fall on the evil seal
0.5;The letter to Mai-san was \Nproof of their quarrel,
0.5;and as the first person to discover the \Nbody, suspicion would fall on Mai-san first.
0.5;And the brooch at the crime scene would seem \Nlike evidence that Mai-san was the culprit.
0.5;to climb the scaffolding \Nthat had been tampered with?
0.5;Those stuffed animals can apparently \Nbe controlled using a smartphone.
0.5;They told Ayaka-san exactly \Nwhen to place the brooch there,
0.5;The stuffed animals over \Nthere haven't been sold yet,
0.5;Ran, do you remember what happened \Nwhen we were in the green room?
0.5;She stole the man I loved \Nand tossed him aside.
0.5;But if someone finds out, \Nwe'll both be arrested.
0.5;Nah. Our alibis are perfect, and \NI'll be the one to finish her off.
0.5;I'll send her a letter \Nsaying I want to apologize
0.5;Thank you for even putting \Non the idol outfit.
0.5;We came to hang out at a villa owned \Nby Professor Agasa's acquaintance,
0.5;working for a chivalrous \Nrobber known as Zorro.
0.5;I narrowly rescued Isehara as he was \Nabout to be killed for betraying him,
0.5;He beautifully dances his \Nmystery-solving steps!
0.5;While narrowly avoiding danger, \Nhe'll be brought down!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;we were able to determine \Nthe man with Conan-kun
0.5;In any case, we'll ask the Kanagawa \NPolice to begin searching the ocean
0.5;It's been three hours \Nsince the search started,
0.5;the water below the cliff is deep \Nand the currents there are fast.
0.5;Anyone who fell there would have \Nbeen quickly washed out to sea.
0.5;They'll call us immediately \Nif they find anything.
0.5;Which means this is \Ndirectly below that cliff.
0.5;I don't have time to play \Ndetective with a kid.
0.5;You're not gonna thank me after surviving \Nthe fall from that cliff unscathed?
0.5;You put us through all this \Nunnecessary work, traitor.
0.5;There was a guy who did and revealed \Nthe location of Zorro's hideout.
0.5;I heard Zorro followed him \Noverseas to finish him off.
0.5;Unlike robbing individual homes, \Nwe'll make a fortune in one go.
0.5;We can use Isehara's program to \Ndisable it like we always do.
0.5;I can't believe he ran away and \Nfell straight down into hell.
0.5;Naturally we'll be splitting \Nhis share. Right, Zorro-san?
0.5;I thought it'd be broken \Nafter falling in the sea.
0.5;More importantly, don't \Nyou have something to say?
0.5;Sorry. I need them to think we're \Ndead, or his family will be in danger.
0.5;Well, I don't mind, but make sure \Nyou explain it to them later.
0.5;They've already started working \Non disabling the target's security
0.5;So one of those passwords \Nwas for checking that.
0.5;We were called to provide \Nentertainment at tonight's party.
0.5;You're under arrest for \Nrobbery, arson, and murder.
0.5;No, thank you. That was \Nsome impressive work.
0.5;You modified a photo you found \Nonline to make them appear
0.5;to be your family so Zorro and his \Nmen would believe you had a weakness.
0.5;You were after the money he \Nstole from the beginning.
0.5;They've already started working \Non disabling the target's security
0.5;That password was for remotely transferring \Nthe money into your overseas account.
0.5;You probably assumed you'd be \Nreleased from prison before them.
0.5;You won't be able to withdraw \Na cent of it, Isehara.
0.5;The Onimaru Squad Nobuna \NGaizers have arrived!
0.5;The members of Nobuna \NGaizers are over... Huh?
0.5;"The next episode of Conan \Nis ""The Nobunaga 450 Case!"""
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shimmering nebula!
0.5;Conan's logic is good medicine\Nfor hearts dried by modern society!
0.5;Today's case is in a general\Nhospital! Old Mori's a killer?!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;This is the old man's\N3rd week in the hospital.
0.5;He broke his leg while\Ntrying to catch a criminal...
0.5;But, you've been so busy lately\Nthat this is a good chance to relax.
0.5;The famous detective\Nsure has an appetite!
0.5;That's not how a famous\Ndetective acts, Dad! How pathetic!
0.5;Be careful you're not made\Ninto a guinea pig, Detective!
0.5;Detective, if I'm ever killed,\NDr. Shirai will have done it!
0.5;That was Eto-kun, a fellow surgeon.\NWe attended college together.
0.5;He has a sharp tongue,\Nbut he's a talented surgeon.
0.5;It's started raining. Maybe we\Nshould get going, Conan-kun?
0.5;Mori-san, you can't have alcohol,\Nbut you can have some coffee.
0.5;This latest case was a good one\NI solved using my great skills!
0.5;Someone's being murdered!\NCall 110! Hurry!
0.5;That's the only possibility,\Nbut I did see it...
0.5;But it's a fact that\Nthere was nothing--
0.5;Now, now. It's late.\NYou'll disturb the patients.
0.5;Well, I guess I did fall asleep\Nwhile telling you my story...
0.5;So, the famous detective was tired.\NTalk about a panic monger...
0.5;However, the old man witnessed the\Nsame thing many more times!
0.5;What's with you, Dad?!\NThis is the fourth time!
0.5;I can only guess that the stress of\Ndealing with all those crimes
0.5;Dad! Calm down!\NPull yourself together!
0.5;It did rain twice during the\Ntime he witnessed the murders...
0.5;In other words,\Nthis window was open then...
0.5;If the lights are on\Nin that room at night,
0.5;the dark building behind it will\Ncause the window to act like a mirror.
0.5;And, depending on the\Nangle of the open window,
0.5;The real room isn't\Nvisible from his window.
0.5;...and looks to him as\Nif it's happening in here!
0.5;Is this just a prank, or is there\Nanother reason behind it?
0.5;I'm gonna stay with\Nhim tonight to look after him!
0.5;Well, Mori-san,\Ntake these and get some sleep.
0.5;There's nobody here,\Nand the dummy hasn't been used...
0.5;and there were no vital\Nreactions on the second one.
0.5;Mori-san's doctor, Shirai.\NI'm on night duty tonight...
0.5;Oh, Mori-san has been under a\Nlot of stress lately, you see...
0.5;so I was worried he might\Ndo something like this...
0.5;But I saw the murder\Nin the opposite room, too!
0.5;but your testimony would be\Ndeemed as a cover for Mori-kun
0.5;...come to think of it, my memory\Ndoes go blank sometimes...
0.5;I could have easily committed\Na murder during then!
0.5;Stop being stupid!\NPull yourself together, Dad!
0.5;Anyway, from the locations\Nof the room, stairs, elevators,
0.5;Incidentally, I hear you and the\Nvictim had heated disagreements?
0.5;I was in my own room on\Nthe 2nd floor of the north ward.
0.5;Okita-kun. You delivered my\Ncharts at about that time, right?
0.5;I brought your charts.\NAnd some coffee.
0.5;I'm on the phone, so could\Nyou just leave 'em on the desk?
0.5;So, although you didn't see him,\Nyou're sure you spoke with him
0.5;An anonymous person had called\Nto complain about my diagnosis.
0.5;Dr. Shirai's alibi\Ndoes seem airtight. But...
0.5;Dr. Shirai clearly opened\Nthe old man's curtains
0.5;so he would witness\Nthose murder scenes...
0.5;No doubt about it!\NThe killer was Dr. Shirai!
0.5;"Don't worry! This is the unique\Npose ""Sleeping Kogoro"" takes"
0.5;This is a cleverly devised\Ntwo-step crime, everyone.
0.5;The first step was to mentally\Ndrive me into a corner enough
0.5;to convince me and everyone\Nelse that I committed a murder
0.5;The second step was\Nto commit that murder
0.5;and then execute his alibi trick\Nto avoid being suspected himself.
0.5;To do so, he first used the first-aid\Ndummy in the fourth floor storeroom.
0.5;The killer opened the murder\Nroom window at a certain angle
0.5;and made his fake murders\Nin the storeroom reflect off of it
0.5;he called the victim into\Nthe room and murdered him.
0.5;Just like his previous acts,\Nbut this time for real.
0.5;But how could he get you\Nto witness it so conveniently?
0.5;To do that, the killer visited\Nmy room, opened the curtains,
0.5;and had me take an adjusted\Namount of sleeping medicine.
0.5;In addition, he set the alarm clock\Nto 11:30, the time of the murder.
0.5;He had her deliver the charts then,\Nand he even talked with her!
0.5;First, the doctor called his cell\Nphone from his room just after 11:00,
0.5;turned on the speaker, and went\Nto the murder room in the north ward.
0.5;used the body to act\Nout a murder at 11:30,
0.5;and then used his cell phone to converse\Nwith the nurse over the phone.
0.5;Then, when I arrived on the scene,\Nhe hit me with a blunt object,
0.5;knocked me out, and put the knife\Nin my hands to put my prints on it.
0.5;Finally, he returned to his\Nroom during the commotion
0.5;He must have felt quite\Nrelieved that it was all over.
0.5;The coffee the\Nnurse kindly brought him.
0.5;I assume you all know\NDr. Shirai has a real sweet tooth?
0.5;However, the coffee's\Nsugar hadn't been used at all.
0.5;Ridiculous. Even I take\Nit without sugar sometimes.
0.5;Yeah, but if you're going to say\Nhow there was no saliva on it,
0.5;that might be because\NI gave it a quick rinse.
0.5;Your fingerprints.\NThere aren't any on the coffee cup.
0.5;But the fingerprints of the nurse\Nwho brought it are on the handle.
0.5;Are you saying you washed off\Nyour fingerprints from on top of hers?
0.5;In short, when you rinsed the\Ncoffee cup, you had gloves on.
0.5;The surgical gloves you\Nhad used during the murder...
0.5;When he returned to\Nhis room after the murder,
0.5;he probably still had\Nthe weapon he hit me with.
0.5;He couldn't get his prints\Non it before he disposed of it.
0.5;or else his alibi of being in\Nthe room would seem suspect,
0.5;For that reason, only the nurse's\Nfingerprints remained on the cup.
0.5;Are there any other reasons your\Nfingerprints weren't on the handle?
0.5;Leaving evidence because of the\Ngloves I wore to leave no evidence...
0.5;Our chief surgeon is being\Nforced to retire next month.
0.5;Eto and I were the\Ncandidates for his position...
0.5;I had no choice but\Nto accept his demand...
0.5;He knew I had bought\Nmy way into medical school.
0.5;After all, the professor\NI paid off was his father!
0.5;In other words, crime and\Ndishonesty doesn't pay, Doctor.
0.5;I hate this! I'm through\Nwith this Sleeping Kogoro stuff!
0.5;How come? You solved\Nthat case easily enough!
0.5;I guess old Sleeping Kogoro\Nis still going strong after all!
0.5;After she was knocked\Nout with chloroform,
0.5;That means the killer\Nis still inside this lodge!
0.5;I was a famous high school detective\Nthat solved countless difficult cases!
0.5;But one day some organization forced me\Nto take a pill that shrunk me...
0.5;...and turned me into Conan Edogawa!\NAlthough small, my mind is the same!
0.5;I hide my identity,\Nbut I'm a great detective!
0.5;Hey, Conan! Are you looking\Nforward to tonight's game?
0.5;That's obvious! The Tokyo Spirits,\Nbecause they got Hideo!
0.5;But Naoki hurt himself\Npracticing a while back,
0.5;I think the offense and defense of\NRamusu's Big Osaka team are better!
0.5;You need help from the\Ndetective agency, right?
0.5;He suddenly disappeared,\Nand I didn't know what else to do...
0.5;I'm sure it's just\Na big misunderstanding!
0.5;There's no mistake!\NI've even kissed him!
0.5;when he was actually fooling\Naround with some other girls.
0.5;Sorry, but I've never\Nseen you before in my life.
0.5;Was kissing really\Nas far as you two went?
0.5;About the new gadget I gave you\Nthis morning, the battery--
0.5;Sure thing! I'll pass\Nthe message on to her!
0.5;Yeah. He said he'd call Ryoko-san\Nlater so don't worry about him.
0.5;We'll all go together,\Nand then I can teach him a lesson!
0.5;The lock has marks on it\Nfrom being tampered with...
0.5;Tell me, Akagi-san. How long\Nhave you been seeing Shinichi?
0.5;As his childhood friend,\NI just have to know.
0.5;Who does she think she is,\Nignoring me like that?!
0.5;Looks like I need to delve\Na little deeper into this.
0.5;The National Sports Stadium\Nis really livening up
0.5;as the championship match\Nof the Sunday Cup continues!
0.5;Will the Tokyo Spirits\Nbe the first to score?
0.5;What's with suddenly\Nswitching the TV on?!
0.5;Does she hate the idea of\Ntalking to me that much?!
0.5;That's right! Ryoko-san\Ninsisted on watching it!
0.5;Is 19-year old Hideo Akagi\Nstarting to show signs of age?!
0.5;Come to think of it, the magazines\Nsaid that his parents died 2 years ago
0.5;Which means that she really\Ndoesn't live here at all!
0.5;Then why is she here?\NAnd why use a fake name?!
0.5;I'll use the gizmo the Professor\Ngave me this morning...
0.5;This is my latest invention,\Nthe Mobile Boxed Lunch Fax Machine!
0.5;All he did was shove a fax machine\Ninside a boxed lunch.
0.5;He's the younger brother of Hideo Akagi,\Nwho's playing on TV right now.
0.5;The kidnapper's demand was that\Nhe lose the game on purpose.
0.5;You said that you were\Ngoing out with me
0.5;because you wanted to get in contact\Nwith me as quickly as possible.
0.5;I assume that the kidnapper\Nthreatened to kill Mamoru
0.5;if you got the police\Nor any detectives involved.
0.5;The reason you used\Nthe false name of Ryoko Akagi
0.5;was because you didn't want to\Nraise suspicion from the others.
0.5;and then tell me what\Nwas really going on there.
0.5;Oh, uh, that's because\NI'm a great detective!
0.5;Please write down the details\Nabout Mamoru-kun's kidnapping
0.5;What's the deal?!\NThat's Shinichi on the phone, isn't it?
0.5;I'm so happy! Shinichi-san\Nunderstood what I wanted...
0.5;I'm hearing my voice\Nfrom the other phone!
0.5;"""I'm sending the kidnapper's letter\Nthat was on the table"
0.5;"along with the letter the kidnapper\Nmade Mamoru-chan write."""
0.5;Ran might actually be more\Ndifficult to handle than this case!
0.5;A brilliant play that broke\Nthrough the opponent's defense!
0.5;Mamoru-kun is dead if I don't\Nfind the kidnapper soon!
0.5;This was a 3rd grader\Nthat was kidnapped.
0.5;it's unnatural for his room\Nto be this messed up!
0.5;This is the Onimaru Quest game\Nthat came out yesterday...
0.5;A kidnapped kid wouldn't\Ntake a game with him...
0.5;Come to think of it, Genta and\NMitsuhiko mentioned something...
0.5;Yeah! And you can't beat it\Nwithout bringing him back to life!
0.5;Mamoru-kun used his own name\Nfor the main character's name!
0.5;The Mamoru in that letter meant\Nthe game's main character!
0.5;Aha! Naoki Uemura, the one\Nwho joined the Spirits last year!
0.5;I've found out where\NMamoru-kun is, Ryoko-san.
0.5;But first, do you know a person\Nnamed Naoki Uemura?
0.5;Of course! He's Hideo's best friend.\NHe lives real close by!
0.5;Tell me, does he come by often\Nto play with Mamoru-kun?
0.5;Yes, Naoki-san knows\Na lot about video games...
0.5;The scratches on the front door lock\Nand the ransacked bedroom...
0.5;The full message of Mamoru-kun's\Nletter probably went like this:
0.5;"""I'm going to Naoki's house so he\Ncan bring Mamoru back to life."""
0.5;The kidnapper tore out and used\Nonly that one part of the message!
0.5;T-Then you're saying\Nthe one who took him was...
0.5;That's right. The one\Nresponsible is Naoki Uemura.
0.5;Most likely Mamoru-kun\Nis at his house.
0.5;I'm using the toilet right now,\NI can't just come out!
0.5;Tell me she's not going\Nto use karate on the door!
0.5;Shinichi-san says he wants\Nto talk to you on the phone!
0.5;If he needs to say something\Nto me, he can say it right here!
0.5;If you wanna give me more\Nof your excuses, then fine.
0.5;He said he was going\Nto rescue Mamoru-kun...
0.5;Does that mean he went\Nto Naoki-san's place?
0.5;Naoki's? Is that where\NShinichi ran off to?!
0.5;What's happened to\Nour gifted Hideo Akagi?!
0.5;I wouldn't want her\Nto get the wrong idea.
0.5;I told you not to leave the house\Nwithout saying a word!
0.5;Oh yeah! I finally beat the game\Nthanks to Naoki-chan!
0.5;He's playing like the\Nfirst half was all a ruse!
0.5;Hideo's got a gift,\Nwhile I'm a man of hard work.
0.5;Both his popularity and\Nsalary are higher than mine!
0.5;Yet we had basically the same number\Nof goals back in high school!
0.5;I spent everyday rigorously training\Nso that I could outdo him!
0.5;Until he shattered my right leg\Nduring a practice match, that is.
0.5;That's right. He intentionally\Nwent for my leg!
0.5;He was afraid that\NI had outclassed him!
0.5;It's put me on the sideline for\N3 full months, all thanks to him!
0.5;But I never had any\Nintentions of hurting Mamoru.
0.5;After the match, I was going\Nto return him to his house
0.5;The Tokyo Spirits have won\Nthe Sunday Cup, 3 to 1!
0.5;Who would you like to dedicate\Nthis victory to the most?
0.5;Well, I would like to dedicate it\Nto my younger brother Mamoru,
0.5;but I really have to give\Nthis one to Naoki instead.
0.5;After he joined the team,\NI started scoring more!
0.5;He hasn't even the slightest\Nidea of what I've done...
0.5;Now that you mention it,\Nwe haven't seen him at all...
0.5;I didn't always know it,\Nhe gave it to me today...
0.5;Darn it! Of all times,\Nwhy won't it open now?!
0.5;You're not getting away\Nthis time, Shinichi!
0.5;I thought you were\Nworking on a difficult case!
0.5;I don't know what's\Ngoing on anymore!
0.5;Just come out and\Nexplain it all, Shinichi!
0.5;What's it matter to you? It's my own\Ndecision to cry if I want to!
0.5;If you're looking for Shinichi,\Nhe ran off that way while blushing!
0.5;No police were involved\Nin this latest incident.
0.5;...and it took 3 full days for her\Nto finally believe I was innocent.
0.5;We met a strange boy staring \Nintently at an apartment.
0.5;"According to him, \Na ""considerate lady"" was killed."
0.5;At the apartment, we discovered \Nthe body of Komai Yasue-san,
0.5;whose death may have been \Nmade to look like a suicide.
0.5;The three men who came to \Nthe woman's room are here!
0.5;The case comes to a money-related \Nand surprising conclusion.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;I stuck a Detective Boys badge \Nin Detective Takagi's pocket.
0.5;You're the one who stole the \N500,000 from the room.
0.5;Under the feet of her hanging \Nbody, the bills were rolling—
0.5;Are you sure you didn't kill \Nher before stealing the money?
0.5;10 million would be about \N10 centimeters tall, though.
0.5;If the culprit lifted her \Nbody to hang it, then...
0.5;A bag of manuscript paper \Nwas left by her feet.
0.5;I felt bad, but I entered the \Napartment in my shoes to pick it up.
0.5;All the errors and corrections \Nmake them hard to read.
0.5;I always have my AD type up the \Nscripts before I read them.
0.5;It's a two hour special, \Nso about a hundred pages.
0.5;She's actually the ghostwriter \Nof a famous scriptwriter.
0.5;I thought it would cause problems if the \Nscript was made public as part of the case.
0.5;but the scriptwriter fell in love with the \Nrealistic and original crimes she wrote.
0.5;They use impressive means to steal \Nfrom evil wealthy individuals.
0.5;But in the final episode, they killed the \Ncouple they robbed, and the group disbanded.
0.5;Oh, but in this script, they were \Nsupposed to get the group back together.
0.5;The couple they thought they \Nkilled was actually alive.
0.5;I never thought it would become \Nher posthumous work, though.
0.5;The truth is, she asked me to \Ncome here so she could apologize.
0.5;The bar's owner and other \Ncustomers saw us fighting.
0.5;I doubted anyone would believe me if I \Nsaid I found her hanging when I got here.
0.5;I had no idea that boy \Nwatched me come and go.
0.5;killing the wife and husband and making \Noff with two million yen in cash.
0.5;He happened to be on a field \Ntrip and escaped unscathed.
0.5;Since the incident, the \Nthieves have been missing.
0.5;But the numbers on the cash \Nhappened to be written down.
0.5;There's definitely 500,000 \Nyen in there somewhere.
0.5;after watching the three of you \Ncome to and leave this room,
0.5;the witness came here to find the dead \Nscriptwriter Komai Yasue-san hanging.
0.5;Because there was nothing \Nto stand on near her feet,
0.5;she must have been murdered and\Nmade to look like she'd killed herself.
0.5;I took the money around her \Nfeet, but I didn't kill her!
0.5;I just took the manuscript \Npapers by her feet.
0.5;Likewise, she was already dead by the time I \Ncame in, and I didn't take anything with me.
0.5;Could you tell us the approximate \Ntimes you came to the apartment?
0.5;She asked me to come after two, \Nbut I don't know the exact time.
0.5;When I called her cell from a pay \Nphone, that's what she told me.
0.5;So even though you all came after \Ntwo, none of you ran into each other?
0.5;...not to reveal when she\Nasked them to come.
0.5;It's because the big man was standing next \Nto him to block the wind for him, right?
0.5;It means the old man is \Njust that important to him.
0.5;That's why he approached \Nhim to block the wind.
0.5;Since he was outside, as long as he didn't get\Ntoo close, the smoke wouldn't bother him.
0.5;And when the long-haired man borrowed\Nthe lighter, he turned down the flame.
0.5;How did you know the old man keeps the\Nflame strong on his lighter before lighting it?
0.5;Besides, while he was smoking, the big \Nman approached him to glare at him.
0.5;The long-haired man got scared and \Nput out his barely smoked cigarette.
0.5;By agreeing on your stories, you're \Ntrying to hide when you came here.
0.5;If you all say the lady was \Nalready dead when you arrived,
0.5;then that would mean the first \Nperson killed her and is lying.
0.5;That's why the old man \Nstole her phone, right?
0.5;You didn't want the police to \Nknow in which order you came.
0.5;By e-mailing instead of calling, she could\Ngive you precise times down to the minute.
0.5;even though you were summoned \Naround the same time.
0.5;It took the old man a while to notice it \Nwas his phone that was ringing, right?
0.5;I'd better get the badge \Nfrom Detective Takagi later.
0.5;Shibakaru-san, may we \Nexamine your cell phone?
0.5;Well, it doesn't matter if the phone\Ntells us in what order they arrived.
0.5;A notebook, tape, and 20,000 \Nyen in thousand yen notes.
0.5;It's something like an \Narts and crafts project.
0.5;All you did was make tubes out of 20 \Nthousand yen notes with tape and line them up.
0.5;I bet the long-haired man \Nhas seen these tubes before.
0.5;You almost said the money was rolling \Naround under the dead woman's feet.
0.5;"If those were scattered on the floor, you \Ncertainly would call it ""rolling around."""
0.5;Each tube can support \Nabout 1 kilogram, so...
0.5;By putting a hundred sheets of \Nmanuscript paper in an envelope
0.5;and placing that over 500 thousand \Nyen's worth of rolled up bills,
0.5;she created a stand that \Nwould support her weight.
0.5;and Habanaka-san took the\Nenvelope of manuscript paper,
0.5;which got rid of the stand and \Nmade it look like a murder.
0.5;we wouldn't know she invited the three \Nof them within minutes of each other.
0.5;If anyone saw you coming or going, \Nwe would suspect you murdered her.
0.5;The proof is stuck to the sole \Nof the long-haired man's sandal.
0.5;It's the tape the lady \Nused to roll up the bills.
0.5;The lady's fingerprints \Nshould be on the tape,
0.5;and traces of tape should be on the \N500,000 he deposited at the ATM.
0.5;Go to the bank at the ATM and \Nconfirm this immediately.
0.5;A-Actually, I asked \NShinichi-niichan about the case,
0.5;and was just reading what \Nhe wrote back to me.
0.5;I only took it because I didn't \Nwant you to suspect me.
0.5;I don't know why she killed herself \Nand made it look like we did it,
0.5;but in my case, it was probably \Nbecause of the fight at the bar.
0.5;In my case, it was probably because \NI suddenly asked for my money back.
0.5;because she hadn't set out on her own \Nyet was probably a factor as well.
0.5;She gave her life trying to frame that shady\Ntrio, and you exposed the trick so easily.
0.5;It was written in Komai Yasue-san's \Nscript you gave to your AD!
0.5;Along with Habanaka Kuramichi, \NShibakaru Denji, and Sakaba Ronbei,
0.5;she was a member of a gang of thieves \Nthat performed a series of robberies!
0.5;She also wrote the photo \Nproving it is on her phone,
0.5;and the money you stole is \Ninside a Tohto Bank ATM!
0.5;Why don't we have a long chat at the station \Nabout whether or not it is a mistake.
0.5;they found the 500,000 she withdrew from\Nthe bank inside a cushion in her apartment.
0.5;But she had the 500,000 \Nshe stole a long time ago.
0.5;So the police would notice \Nthe 500,000 was stolen.
0.5;Otherwise they wouldn't \Nhave figured out the trick.
0.5;She probably meant to make the \Nthree of them murder suspects,
0.5;I'm surprised you knew she hadn't \Ntouched the 500,000, though.
0.5;In their final robbery and \Nmurder, they stole two million.
0.5;Also, I had several reasons for \Nknowing they were the thieves,
0.5;but the decisive reason was \Nwhat the old man Shibakaru said.
0.5;I had no idea that boy \Nwatched me come and go.
0.5;The inspector looked at all of \Nus when he mentioned the suspect,
0.5;but the old man knew it was \Nthe boy, Ganno Mamoru-kun.
0.5;It's proof he knew Komai-san was close \Nto their victims' son Mamoru-kun.
0.5;Don't you think it was cruel of her \Nto make him the witness, though?
0.5;If she didn't want Mamoru-kun \Nto know she was a thief,
0.5;or they'd kill Mamoru-kun if \Nshe didn't return to the group.
0.5;She probably meant to atone with \Nher own death, but she was wrong.
0.5;On top of killing his parents, she made\NMamoru-kun lose the friend he'd finally made.
0.5;Conan's logic works great on\Nhearts tired by modern society!
0.5;Today's case is a stalker!\NLet's think about what bothers people!
0.5;Yeah! Today is\Nperfect walking weather!
0.5;It was still dark when you woke\Nme up. I didn't get enough sleep!
0.5;Are you sure there\Nwasn't one already there?
0.5;But there are no signs\Nof it being opened,
0.5;and nothing looks\Nout of the ordinary.
0.5;The deceased is Nagai\NTatsuya-san, 26.
0.5;He lived on 3rd Street\Nin Midori-dai.
0.5;I just thought I saw\Nhim somewhere before...
0.5;The poison in the Guts-Man might\Nbe an organic phosphate compound.
0.5;Yes. Small amounts cause\Nnausea or drooling,
0.5;while large amounts result\Nin respiratory failure.
0.5;Inspector Megure. This was\Nan indiscriminate murder.
0.5;The killer placed the poisoned\NGuts-Man in the corner like so.
0.5;Then Nagai-san stopped by\Nand bought a Guts-Man.
0.5;But it was the poisoned one\Nhe took, not the one he purchased.
0.5;Then, after drinking it, the poison\Ntook effect and he collapsed.
0.5;But is there proof the killer put\Nthe poisoned Guts-Man in there?
0.5;When I did, I found an\Nextra bottle down there.
0.5;Say, there's a seal on\Nthat Guts-Man!
0.5;It's for a special campaign,\Nbut it ended three days ago!
0.5;As proof, there aren't\Nany on your bottles.
0.5;I see. This may\Nserve as a vital clue.
0.5;I just remembered! I stopped\Nand questioned that man before!
0.5;A woman in an apartment up\Nahead reported being troubled
0.5;by a creepy man who\Nconstantly followed her around.
0.5;That's when I found\Nthis man loitering out in front!
0.5;Yes. He followed\Nher because he liked her.
0.5;But he hadn't actually done anything,\Nso I gave him a stern warning.
0.5;He said he was studying\Nfor entrance exams.
0.5;Is that woman's\Napartment near here?
0.5;So maybe he was heading\Nthere again? Or following her?!
0.5;But she didn't report\Nanything since then,
0.5;so I figured he had\Nstopped following her...
0.5;Yes. He consumed a poisoned\Nenergy drink only forty minutes ago.
0.5;Pardon my asking,\Nbut where were you at the time?
0.5;We close up at 4:00,\Nso I left around 5:00.
0.5;Did you take the train\Nto Beika Station?
0.5;Nishitani-san. Please show us\Nwhat route you took coming home.
0.5;She passed by the vending machine\Nand the spot where he collapsed!
0.5;In other words,\Nhe was following you.
0.5;And I was so relieved once he\Ndisappeared after he was warned!
0.5;Did she really not realize\Nshe was being followed?
0.5;The windows and door\Nhave extra locks...
0.5;And she even has\Ndefense spray ready...
0.5;Were these merely from when\Nshe was afraid of her stalker?
0.5;It was an organic phosphate\Ncompound in the Guts-Man.
0.5;In other words, it's very likely\Nthe killer prepared it in advance.
0.5;Did you determine where that\NGuts-Man bottle was purchased?
0.5;then it was bought between yesterday\Nafternoon and seven days ago.
0.5;Yesterday, the company replaced\Nall the bottles with seal-less ones.
0.5;Nagai-san's mother recently\Nmoved here from Shizuoka.
0.5;I checked her\Napartment and found this.
0.5;I visited Nishitani-san\Nagain before coming here.
0.5;She had no idea\Nshe was photographed...
0.5;and dreamed of\Nopening her own store.
0.5;Did she move here\Nto escape Nagai-san?
0.5;so she started working\Nnights at a restaurant instead.
0.5;But Nagai-san received money\Nfrom his father, an ironsmith,
0.5;Meaning he could follow\Nher whenever he wanted.
0.5;That's one lousy man\Nshe got caught up with.
0.5;Are you saying she poisoned\Nthe Guts-Man and had him drink it?
0.5;and left the poisoned\None when she picked it up.
0.5;If Nagai-san also bought\None and grabbed the wrong one--
0.5;But there was no guarantee\Nhe'd buy the same drink...
0.5;You're forgetting\Nsomething important. Look.
0.5;Nobody would drink it if they saw\Nthe cap had already been undone.
0.5;Which means the killer didn't\Nleave it in that vending machine?
0.5;Oh, one other thing\Nabout Nagai-san...
0.5;His neighbors saw him leave his\Napartment around 10:00 last night
0.5;He was empty-handed\Nwhen he collapsed this morning...
0.5;It might have nothing to do with\Nthe incident, but it bothers me...
0.5;Isn't there a way she could've\Nhad him drink an opened Guts-Man?
0.5;You're after the rest\Nof her cola, aren't you?
0.5;Let's take a swim,\NMitsuhiko-kun!
0.5;I know how it was done,\Nbut there's no proof!
0.5;I was hoping to learn that the\Nvictim bought the Guts-Man here...
0.5;Did you check the fingerprints\Non the coins in the vending machine?
0.5;Yes, but we didn't\Nfind the victim's prints.
0.5;But we did find two coins totaling\N110 yen that had been wiped clean.
0.5;So the killer did\Nbuy the Guts-Man here!
0.5;If only this had\Nbeen a bigger shop...
0.5;Sometimes you'll catch\N'em on surveillance video...
0.5;Say, did you check everything\NNagai-san was carrying?
0.5;What was he carrying?\NMr. Mori asked me to ask you.
0.5;A wallet, a license, cigarettes,\Nan apartment key, and a lighter.
0.5;It had a flip top and was a\Nlittle bigger than normal ones.
0.5;We returned it to\Nthe victim's mother.
0.5;What is this about?\NI need to leave for work...
0.5;Nishitani-san.\NPlease tell work you won't be in.
0.5;Because you're the one who\Npoisoned and killed Nagai-san!
0.5;That morning, you knew\NNagai-san was following you
0.5;so you bought a Guts-Man\Nfrom that vending machine.
0.5;You then took your\Npre-prepared Bottle B
0.5;and pretended to pick up\NBottle A as he watched on.
0.5;You removed the cap\Nand drank it as you walked.
0.5;"But it was not the Bottle B\Nwhich you had just drunk;"
0.5;it was yet another bottle you had\Nprepared in advance: Bottle C.
0.5;Incidentally, stalkers are known\Nto collect their prey's belongings.
0.5;So Nagai-san naturally\Ntook Guts-Man Bottle C.
0.5;He found a large amount\Nof the drink left inside.
0.5;As he was infatuated with you,\Nhe happily drank it down...
0.5;The reason you left the\NGuts-Man in the machine
0.5;was to make it look like\Nan indiscriminate murder.
0.5;Your fingerprints were absent\Nfrom the coins used to buy Bottle A
0.5;When we first visited, she slyly\Nrubbed something off her fingers.
0.5;It's unnatural to wear\Ngloves this time of year,
0.5;and holding the bottle in a tissue\Nwould've roused his suspicion.
0.5;Theorize all you want.\NYou have no proof.
0.5;It seems you didn't know he\Nwas secretly photographing you.
0.5;"I can't blame you; he was\Nusing a customized camera."
0.5;He was good with his hands,\Nlike his skilled ironsmith father.
0.5;that there is a seal\Non the Guts-Man there.
0.5;As you said, all the Guts-Man\Nbottles in that vending machine
0.5;were replaced with new, seal-less\Nbottles yesterday afternoon.
0.5;One week ago, when I walked\Ndown the station stairs...
0.5;"His look said, ""How dare you\Ntell the police! I'm gonna kill you!"""
0.5;So I felt my only\Nchoice was to kill him first!
0.5;Inspector. It's a fact that\NNagai-san planned to kill her.
0.5;and was hidden by a nearby lamppost\Nthat had been freshly painted.
0.5;Nagai-san probably planned to\Nget the bag when she came home,
0.5;wait for his chance to get inside\Nby cutting a hole in the window,
0.5;but you'll likely get off\Non mitigating circumstances.
0.5;Atone for your sin\Nas quickly as possible
0.5;and then continue toward your\Ndream of running your own bakery.
0.5;This case really made me think,\Nespecially about stalkers.
0.5;You do get clients who\Ntalk about being followed
0.5;The police won't do much,\Nbut even if they do do something,
0.5;the instant the crazed person\Nfinds out you're strongly repulsed,
0.5;they can turn into\Na full-fledged criminal.
0.5;Don't worry! Nobody'd ever\Ngo crazy for a shrew like you!
0.5;There's no blood around\Na part of his wrist!
0.5;High school student Shinichi was\Nforced to take a drug that shrunk him!
0.5;Although smaller, my mind\Nremains that of a sharp detective!
0.5;He's a shepherd dog known\Nthroughout the neighborhood!
0.5;Dogs may not speak, but\Nthere's always only one truth!
0.5;He was still just a\Npuppy when I was a kid,
0.5;John. I'm not high school\Nstudent Kudo Shinichi anymore,
0.5;I'm grade school student\NConan Edogawa now.
0.5;Hey, this is the place!\NThe house where John the dog lives!
0.5;Shinichi used to stop by here\Non his way home from school.
0.5;He would save some bread from\Nlunch and then give it to the dog!
0.5;He's a famous lawyer who\Nspecializes in cases involving minors.
0.5;Wasn't this the house where that\Nmiddle school student killed himself
0.5;Hello? What's going on,\NTakeshi-kun?!
0.5;I just heard Takeshi-kun\Nscream-- what happened?!
0.5;Come home right away!\NJohn's done something terrible!
0.5;The victim was Maehara\NTakeshi, twenty-two years old.
0.5;He's a college student who lives\Nin the apartment complex next door,
0.5;and Sakaguchi-san asked him to\Nwatch the place while he was gone?
0.5;And Takeshi-san invited you,\NSugita Sanae-san, over.
0.5;I've never been in\Nsuch a huge living room!
0.5;He's at the top of the stairs,\Nbehaving himself.
0.5;Here, your master\Nwants to talk to you.
0.5;I can only think that he attacked\NTakeshi for no reason at all!
0.5;No way! John would never\Nattack anyone for no reason!
0.5;What's going to happen\Nto the dog, Inspector?
0.5;but if he really attacked\Nfor no reason as she says,
0.5;then he'll probably\Nhave to be put to sleep.
0.5;Put to sleep?\NYou're going to kill him?!
0.5;At any rate, we first need\Nto talk to Sakaguchi-san...
0.5;"""First year middle school\Nstudent kills himself."""
0.5;and he'd never attack\Nanyone for no reason at all.
0.5;John attacked the victim immediately\Nafter the phone was put to his ear.
0.5;"But Sakaguchi-san always seems\Nso nice; he'd never do such a thing!"
0.5;You didn't put him\Nto sleep already, did you?!
0.5;"He's been taken to\Nthe police station for now;"
0.5;He says he can't believe\Nthat John would attack anyone.
0.5;Neither can I!\NThere must be a reason why--
0.5;I asked Mr. Sakaguchi\Nabout his phone conversation...
0.5;To start off, what exactly did\Nyou say to the victim over the phone?
0.5;I asked him if everything\Nwas alright, how John was doing,
0.5;and then I asked him\Nto put John on the line.
0.5;I always say good night to him,\Nso I thought I'd say it tonight too.
0.5;"Before that, I think I asked,\N""How are you doing, John?"""
0.5;Then suddenly I heard\NJohn bark and Takeshi-kun scream...
0.5;Sakaguchi-san\Ndidn't say anything else?
0.5;The girl who was\Nthere confirmed his story.
0.5;You mentioned it last night,\Ndidn't you, Ran-neechan?
0.5;I asked him about\Nthat at the station too.
0.5;Maybe his son's bully\Nwas Maehara Takeshi-kun?!
0.5;I heard this directly\Nfrom Sakaguchi-san himself.
0.5;His son Masato-kun\Nand Maehara Takeshi-kun
0.5;Masato-kun apparently wrote\Nabout Takeshi-kun in his diary
0.5;shortly before\Nhanging himself in his room.
0.5;I hear that Mr. Sakaguchi loathed\NTakeshi-kun after reading the diary.
0.5;Since his wife had died early on,\NMasato-kun was all he had left.
0.5;But when he saw Takeshi-kun\Ncrying and apologizing at the funeral,
0.5;Shortly after, Takeshi-kun\Nmoved to western Japan
0.5;Then, two years ago, he moved\Nback to attend a university in Tokyo.
0.5;It was this spring that he\Nmoved into an apartment complex
0.5;Apparently Mr. Sakaguchi was\Nsurprised by the unexpected reunion, too.
0.5;But he no longer bore any\Nill feelings toward Takeshi-kun.
0.5;I'm even told that he sometimes\Ninvited him over for dinner.
0.5;But if he really does still\Nhave a grudge against Takeshi-kun...
0.5;In this way, Mr. Sakaguchi\Naccomplished his revenge!
0.5;he repeated what he said on\Nthe phone, right in front of John.
0.5;John didn't react one\Nbit when he heard him.
0.5;Gah! I thought\NI sounded so authoritative too!
0.5;Don't feel so down\Nin the dumps, Mori-kun!
0.5;I thought you might be lonely\Nwithout John to keep you company!
0.5;Say, does John always\Nsleep at the top of the stairs?
0.5;But his late mother said he\Ncouldn't let the dog in his room,
0.5;so John always\Nslept in front of his door.
0.5;John's still waiting for him to open\Nthe door and say good morning to him!
0.5;Say, wasn't there a\Ncordless phone there last night?
0.5;Yes. I sometimes switch\Nit with the phone in my study.
0.5;The clock must've struck\N9:00 just before it happened!
0.5;Now I see how Sakaguchi-san\Nordered John to attack!
0.5;The receiver on the big\Nphone is connected by a cord.
0.5;But last night he had a\Ncordless phone there, he said.
0.5;Why? There's\Nprobably no real reason--
0.5;Sakaguchi-san absolutely\Nneeded it to be a cordless phone!
0.5;Listen. It would be impossible to\Ncarry a regular phone up a staircase!
0.5;So Sakaguchi-san purposely\Nplaced a portable cordless phone
0.5;So you still think that Sakaguchi-san\Nused John to commit a murder?
0.5;But I don't know the most important thing--\Nhow he ordered the attack!
0.5;it was precisely 9:00 when\NJohn attacked Takeshi-kun!
0.5;The great detective, Mori Kogoro,\Nhas just solved the mystery!
0.5;repeat what you said to\NJohn last night on the phone!
0.5;He would never use the dog\Nthat his son loved to get revenge...
0.5;but what we found out\Nfrom our investigation afterward
0.5;According to him, he took\NJohn to the outskirts of town
0.5;and let him get a lot of\Nexercise in the empty fields.
0.5;Inspector! He obviously\Ntrained John during those times!
0.5;but it's been decided that John\Nis to be put to sleep tomorrow evening.
0.5;is going to be killed\Nif we don't do something!
0.5;So they're going\Nto kill John this evening?!
0.5;I was up all night\Nthinking about it too, you know!
0.5;So you admit you trained\NJohn to attack Maehara Takeshi-kun?!
0.5;He had completely forgotten about\Nthe very person he drove to suicide!
0.5;I'm a lawyer who specializes\Nin crimes committed by minors!
0.5;He was still just a\N1st-year middle school student,
0.5;and I felt that Masato's\Ndeath wouldn't be in vain
0.5;if he truly regretted it\Nwith all his heart!
0.5;But when I met him\Nagain eight years later,
0.5;he didn't remember a\Nsingle thing about the incident!
0.5;Not only that, he was no\Ndifferent than he was eight years ago!
0.5;When I saw that,\NI could feel my blood boil!
0.5;I decided that if the\Nlaw couldn't deal with him,
0.5;then I would take\Njustice into my own hands!
0.5;And I'm sure that John was happy\Nthat he avenged Masato too!
0.5;You weren't the only one who\Nwas sad when Masato-kun died!
0.5;Even now, John still waits\Nfor Masato-kun in front of his door!
0.5;Do you honestly think that\NMasato-kun would be happy
0.5;that you used his\Nloyal dog to kill someone?!
0.5;Sakaguchi-san.\NBullying is definitely wrong.
0.5;And I actually do understand your\Nill will toward Maehara Takeshi-kun.
0.5;But did you ever once think\Nabout the feelings of the dog
0.5;you stupidly used as a\Nmurder tool to get revenge?
0.5;He was taken in by one of\NSakaguchi-san's relatives!
0.5;And it's all thanks to\NMori Kogoro, the great detective!
0.5;But John doesn't live\Nat that house anymore, huh?
0.5;You can always make\Nfriends with another dog!
0.5;You appear to have\Nquite an exceptional dog, Miss.
0.5;What do you say we talk about\Ndogs at that coffee shop over there?!
0.5;I'm dead if she finds out\Nwho I really am!
0.5;As times change, difficult\Ncases will increase in number!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Hattori Heiji showed up,\Nand then I drank his alcohol...
0.5;Drinking that alcohol\Nturned me back to normal!
0.5;If I drink this all,\NI can turn back completely!
0.5;Once I drink that alcohol and\Nturn back into a high school student,
0.5;I might never get to\Nhang out with them again...
0.5;I'm supposed to\Ndo a book report on this?
0.5;And what's with this\Nawkward arrangement?!
0.5;Huh? It's shrink-wrapped\Nin its case backwards...
0.5;Now, now. This isn't\Na book for children.
0.5;Two! Three! Four!\NFive! Six! Seven!
0.5;You're the director\Nof this library, yes?
0.5;a librarian named\NTamada Kazuo-san.
0.5;Actually, Tamada-san has\Nbeen missing since two nights ago.
0.5;I hear he worked overtime\Nwith you two nights ago...
0.5;so I'm not sure\Nwhat happened afterward...
0.5;Say, then why are you\Nchecking the library's storeroom?
0.5;He might've been abducted\Non his way home, you know.
0.5;from this library\Nbefore leaving for home.
0.5;Inspector. We checked all\Ninconspicuous places,
0.5;The elevator!\NSomeone's coming up!
0.5;That's Tsugawa-san,\Nthe library director!
0.5;That's where that\Nweird foreign book was...
0.5;Little did they know Tamada\Nis resting inside this very library...
0.5;Tamada-san's body is\Ninside this library!
0.5;And it was the library\Ndirector who killed him!
0.5;That's the weird book that was\Nshrink-wrapped backwards in its case...
0.5;I don't think we should\Nleave for a while...
0.5;C'mon, Conan, I'm hungry.\NI want an eel boxed lunch...
0.5;He must've put the contents\Nin his bag before he left!
0.5;he must've hid\Nsomewhere in this room.
0.5;Looks like we'll hafta look for the\Nbooks before we look for the body.
0.5;So it's finally time for the Junior\NDetective League to do its stuff?!
0.5;Let's split up and\Ncheck both sides!
0.5;Looks like they're\Nnot in this bookcase.
0.5;"I get it! These books weren't\Nbackwards in their cases;"
0.5;They would think it's\Na book on the other side,
0.5;This is the children's corner,\Nwhich makes it all the more believable.
0.5;The books were all skewed\Nbecause the middle books pushed them.
0.5;The fact these weird books\Nare imported from overseas
0.5;probably means\Nthey contain guns, or...
0.5;So basically, that library\Ndirector is smuggling drugs?!
0.5;Huh? That's strange.\NI can't get through...
0.5;Yeah. Our only option now is\Nto leave and tell the police directly.
0.5;Then let's find the\Nbody too while we're at it!
0.5;Yeah! Good thinking!\NThat'll double our achievement!
0.5;Once we find the body,\Nwe'll be so famous!
0.5;That's what you get for\Nwearing those annoying shoes!
0.5;Hey! There are weird\Nbookcases in the back!
0.5;Mitsuhiko! Ayumi-chan!\NHelp me move this!
0.5;And there's\Nnothing strange here...
0.5;Which means the\Nreason it wouldn't move...
0.5;Just endure it! Today's my last\Nday hanging out with these kids!
0.5;Once I drink that alcohol\Nand return to being a high schooler...
0.5;I'm only 15 kilograms!\NYou need to diet more!
0.5;Hold on! I was 18 kg\Nwhen I last weighed myself!
0.5;No, I only went there to switch\Nthese elevator doors to manual.
0.5;The proof is the overload\Nbuzzer that went off
0.5;when we all got on\Nthe elevator this afternoon.
0.5;there were 8 people\Nin the elevator...
0.5;All together,\Nwe weigh at most 100 kg!
0.5;Even with the weight\Nof the adults and the box,
0.5;there was one whole person\Nmissing for the buzzer to go off!
0.5;Yes. Someone was riding\Nthis elevator from the very start.
0.5;Somewhere where nobody\Ncould see him...
0.5;What are you kiddos\Ndoing here at this hour?
0.5;Don't underestimate us just\Nbecause we're kids, Director!
0.5;and the fact you killed\NTamada-san after he found out!
0.5;Damn you brats!\NYou can't escape me!
0.5;T-They're gone?\NDid they get off?
0.5;I won't try to hurt you now!\NCome on out!
0.5;Do they honestly think\Nthis is a barricade?
0.5;Because I'm about to send\Nall four of you to the afterlife!
0.5;After our call, the police rushed\Nover and arrested Director Tsugawa.
0.5;They also recovered Tamada-san's\Nbody and all the drugs.
0.5;And so Edogawa Conan's\Nfinal case came to an end.
0.5;Together, the four of us\Ncan solve any case easily!
0.5;Alright! Let's try\Nhard next time, too!
0.5;That's right! I'm turning\Nback into my normal body!
0.5;Into high school student,\NKudo Shinichi!
0.5;With this alcohol...\NI can finally be me again!

0.5;C'mon, Doc!\NI haven't turned back one bit!
0.5;Basically, the alcohol somehow\Nturned you back the first time,

0.5;assistant homeroom teacher \NWakasa Rumi out of season.
0.5;We went to the old storage \Nshed to look for lime
0.5;at the request of said clumsy \Nand fearful teacher, but...
0.5;You picked up a schedule \Nin the storage shed, right?
0.5;there's something wrong with \Nthis schedule, isn't there?
0.5;A basement, a skeleton, \Nand a code on a string.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;The characters on the right \Nside are the days of the week.
0.5;A lot of characters that incorporate \Nthe water radical are related to water.
0.5;They're parts of characters \Nfor school subjects.
0.5;we can fill in the forty-nine spaces on this \Nseven by seven grid with Chinese characters.
0.5;And if you apply the Japanese alphabet \Nto them starting at the top left...
0.5;It seems like we should be able to read \Nit when we wrap it around a pen now.
0.5;I'll read out the code, so you \Nguys check it against the key.
0.5;The first character is the \Nearth radical and nobun.
0.5;Even if you apply the \NJapanese alphabet vertically
0.5;Maybe it's not the Japanese \Nalphabet but the English alphabet.
0.5;are these X's drawn here \Nand there on the chart.
0.5;I doubt there's any point \Nin cracking the code
0.5;we found in the hand of a thief who \Ndied in an accident ten years ago.
0.5;There's already a story online about the \Nskeleton we found in the storage shed.
0.5;They even included a photo of \Nthe headband with the code.
0.5;to get some lime for their \Nscience class tomorrow.
0.5;You want us to come with you \Nbecause you're scared, right?
0.5;Well, there was a skeleton \Nin there until recently.
0.5;Could forensics have left this \Nmess while investigating?
0.5;It's more like they were \Nsearching for something.
0.5;Could someone have come \Nafter the police left?
0.5;That's plenty of time to come here \Nafter seeing the code online.
0.5;The guy who wrote that code \Nmay have died ten years ago,
0.5;The person who searched the storage \Nshed could be hiding down there.
0.5;I'll put them to sleep \Nusing my tranquilizer gun.
0.5;Well, they wouldn't be able to run if \Nwe discovered them in the basement.
0.5;Maybe they're planning to return \Nonce the students and teachers leave
0.5;and it's dark outside to resume \Ntheir search for something.
0.5;I want to go home, have \Na drink, and go to sleep.
0.5;One glass, and I can sleep with \Nan Ebisu-like smile on my face.
0.5;That code really is connected \Nto that ten year old case.
0.5;I thought I saw someone watching \Nus from behind the entrance door.
0.5;If I'm right, after the police collected \Nthat skeleton from the basement and left,
0.5;someone ransacked this storage \Nshed in search of something.
0.5;The ones who murdered the \Nwealthy man ten years ago,
0.5;Yeah, because of what \NWakasa-sensei said earlier.
0.5;They're no longer used, but they're \Ncharacters from the Iroha poem.
0.5;"The katakana ""a"" with a \Nline under it is ""ye."""
0.5;"The character that looks like \Nthe ""i"" in ""ido"" is ""wi."""
0.5;Yeah, and if you read the \Ncode using this chart...
0.5;"You get ""Wakemaeha, youishita. Sugunikoi! \N(Your shares, are ready. Come immediately!)"""
0.5;That skeleton belonged to the \Nboss of the thieves who met here.
0.5;He exchanged the ingots for cash \Nand had their shares ready.
0.5;And ten years later, after seeing the \Nnews story and realizing their boss
0.5;prepared their shares before \Nhis accidental death,
0.5;they came here to look for it thinking the \Ncash could still be inside this storage shed.
0.5;that would have led the police to \Nthe money if they were arrested.
0.5;We may not want to tell \Nthem about the money yet.
0.5;If the police act, the thieves \Nwon't come back here.
0.5;Just like Holmes did in \Nthe Dancing Men story.
0.5;Anyway, I'm excited for tonight's \Nepisode of Kamen Yaiba!
0.5;Yeah. The mysterious Lady \NYaiba's going to be in it!
0.5;But this is kind of fun, \Nlike a test of courage.
0.5;I'm surprise the police sent anyone on \Nthe basis of such uncertain information.
0.5;I only came because I thought \NKobayashi-sensei would be here.
0.5;"""Let's meet for the first \Ntime in ten years,"" I think."
0.5;They'll think their boss is \Nstill alive when they read that.
0.5;Come to think of it, the code said \Nhe'd be waiting in the basement.
0.5;I'm Shiratori Ninzaburo with the \NMetropolitan Police Department Section One.
0.5;You're coming down to the station with \Nme for a ten year old robbery and murder.
0.5;There were four thieves, \Nand their boss is dead!
0.5;Why don't you head down into \Nthe basement one by one?
0.5;Take them out with your tranquilizer \Nor ball like you always do.
0.5;I'm not sure I can hit them \Nwith a dart in the dark.
0.5;Yeah. He just suffered a \Nconcussion and is unconscious.
0.5;Have fun teaching your last \Nclass in the basement.
0.5;You took a group of children to catch \Nsome thieves in the middle of the night!
0.5;And the police officer who \Ncame was Shiratori-san!
0.5;Takagi-san or Chiba-san or Sato-san \Nor anyone else would have...

0.5;The professor said he suddenly \Nhad to go to Hokkaido.

0.5;We can't! What do you think \Nwe've been preparing for?

0.5;You're right. Let's have an explosive \Ntime, just like we planned.
0.5;She said something about \Nhaving an explosive time.
0.5;It sounds like they're planning \Nto set off a bomb at this event.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;It'll probably end with them shooing \Nus away like they always do.
0.5;If you want the police to believe you, \Nyou need to calmly come up with a plan.
0.5;Let's calmly come up with a plan \Nso the police will believe us.
0.5;I hate to admit it, but I \Nwish Conan-kun were here.
0.5;What's the most important part \Nof a police investigation?
0.5;If you want the police to act, \Nyou need evidence first.
0.5;If you catch the bad guys, you might \Nbe rewarded with lots of tasty food.

0.5;Th-There's a strange \Nsound coming from inside.
0.5;Good grief. I thought you \Nwere smarter than this.
0.5;Don't I always tell you how \Nimportant it is to observe?
0.5;But after taking a seat once, he switched \Nto a different table closer to the front.
0.5;The back of the restaurant \Nis near the smoking section.
0.5;I see. That certainly sounds \Nlike we're setting up a bomb.
0.5;He was buying oil and gas \Nat the hardware store!
0.5;They must be planning \Nto build a bomb with it!
0.5;We're trying to sell our \Nchicken rice here today.
0.5;We decided to participate in this \Nevent to show off our best dish.
0.5;If we do well today, the restaurant will \Nget lots of customers starting tomorrow.
0.5;The explosive time you heard us talking \Nabout was in reference to explosive sales.
0.5;These. I had a printer \Nfriend make them for me.
0.5;Since I ordered them late, they \Nweren't finished until today.
0.5;I was supposed to pick them up at a \Ncafé, but he was too busy to come,
0.5;Since I had the apron and knife \Nwe use to butcher chicken,
0.5;There was a mistake, and \Nour stuff didn't arrive.
0.5;but we heat up the soup and make \Nthe sauce inside the food truck.
0.5;We received our eating and cooking utensils, \Nbut we don't have any oil or gas.
0.5;but we managed to get everything \Nin time by going out and buying it.
0.5;Although the unnecessary expense \Nwill probably put us in the red.
0.5;Don't worry. If we spread the name \NMarina here, starting tomorrow...
0.5;This might have been a \Nmisunderstanding on our part.
0.5;After all, they say there's \Nno such thing as an evil cook.
0.5;If you really work in a restaurant, you \Nshould be able to make some chicken rice.
0.5;What you normally eat is fried \Nrice flavored with ketchup, right?
0.5;Singaporean chicken rice is \Nrice cooked in chicken broth
0.5;Then you cover it with whatever \Nsauces you want and eat it.
0.5;Why do you have a giant \Nstar on your food truck?
0.5;Chicken rice? You mean rice \Nflavored with ketchup?
0.5;No! Singaporean chicken \Nrice is totally different!
0.5;You serve steamed chicken over rice \Nand eat it with all kinds of sauces.
0.5;They certainly must work at \Na Singaporean restaurant.
0.5;If that old woman learned a \Nbomb was exchanged at her shop,
0.5;If we set it up near the gas tank, \Nthe truck itself will be a bomb.

0.5;Th-They didn't look like \Ntiger claw marks, did they?
0.5;There were four scratches \Nabout ten centimeters apart.
0.5;I thought it was the jars, but \Nthe monster really does exist.
0.5;Since we're in the mountains, they \Nsaid they couldn't make it right away.
0.5;But I don't think the police \Ncan handle a monster like that.

0.5;Someji-san probably fled from his attacker \Nafter he was stabbed in the back,
0.5;and the culprit made a long \Ncut over the initial wound.
0.5;The mayor who invited Someji-san here is \Nprobably the only one who could've done it.
0.5;The truth is I was asked to \Ninvite everyone by a stranger.
0.5;In addition to the notebook \NI showed you at dinner,
0.5;I was also sent some money and a message \Nstating that inviting the four of them
0.5;would rekindle the legend of the buried \Ntreasure and revitalize the village.
0.5;Also included were four \Nletters addressed to them.
0.5;Remember the extra envelope \Nin the letters I sent to you?
0.5;If everyone's rooms were specified \Nlike the mayor said...
0.5;Yes. The notebook he used to practice \Nhiragana was in the desk drawer.
0.5;I don't mind, but don't set one \Nfoot outside of your rooms.
0.5;Absolutely not. I may \Nhave been told to do it,
0.5;As the mayor, I must \Nensure everyone's safety.
0.5;Whatever. As long as you're \Nhere, why don't you tell us?
0.5;Wasn't it written in the \Nletter from the stranger?
0.5;The archaeologist Tanzawa \NMichiki-san is knowledgeable
0.5;He's excavated ruins not just in \NShizuoka but all over the country.
0.5;he was famous as a commentator \Non TV programs on ruins.
0.5;Although he disappeared \Ncompletely after some pottery
0.5;She's famous for her mysterious \Nstories featuring monsters.
0.5;When filming TV adaptations of her work, \Nshe's had shooting locations changed
0.5;and sets repainted because \Nthey didn't match her vision.
0.5;Apparently she graduated from art school, \Nso I can see why it's so important to her.
0.5;That has nothing to do with \NTokugawa's buried treasure.
0.5;Th-The letters suggested using \Nthe nue to revitalize the town,
0.5;was a historian knowledgeable about \NTokugawa's buried treasure, though.
0.5;The letter simply stated \Nthat Tsurumi Hajime-san
0.5;is a fledgling reporter who travels \Nacross the country for monster stories.
0.5;We would've been able to ask \Nthem more about the incident.
0.5;A-Apparently, they all disappeared \Nafter the accident.
0.5;but I used some of the \Nmoney to repair the hotel.
0.5;At first I thought about inviting \NKudo Shinichi-sama of Tokyo,
0.5;but I couldn't get in touch with him, so \NI invited Hattori-sama of Osaka instead.
0.5;So I'm here because the old \Nman and you couldn't make it?
0.5;Your letter said I could \Nbring my female friends.
0.5;Was that in the letter \Nfrom the stranger, too?
0.5;The letter said to invite Detective \NMori's daughter as well.
0.5;It would be better for the village's \Npromotional video to have a young girl in it.
0.5;Look. The other trees in front of \Nthe hotel all have pointed tops,
0.5;There's something that looks like \Ncloth on the end of this burnt stick.
0.5;I was going to take a nap \Nbefore the police arrived,
0.5;who was invited along with \Nall you famous people.
0.5;I won't be able to write a good \Narticle unless I sacrifice sleep
0.5;Besides, there's no telling \Nwhen the monster will appear.

0.5;According to the call we received, \Napparently you saw a giant monster.

0.5;and the grass in front \Nof the hotel caught fire.
0.5;It was so big, it reached \Nthe second-story windows.
0.5;Not only that, but it bit \Nthe sign in front of it,
0.5;pulled it out of the ground, \Nand walked away with it.
0.5;It pulled out the sign \Nand walked away with it?
0.5;We found this sign on the \Nground where the monster went.
0.5;we found the body of the \Nhistorian Someji-san.
0.5;See how the scratches are spaced \Nabout ten centimeters apart?
0.5;We took their phones so they couldn't \Nproduce any sounds, just in case.
0.5;While we were standing\Nin shock, we heard the dying cry
0.5;of archaeologist Tanzawa-san from\Nthe room on the end of the third floor.
0.5;we found him poisoned to \Ndeath in a locked room.
0.5;This time with marks under his chin \Nas though he'd been bitten by a snake.
0.5;Officer, you've heard \Nof the nue, haven't you?
0.5;It has the head of a monkey, \Nthe body of a raccoon dog,
0.5;It's a legendary monster that appears with \Nan eerie cry and a cloud of black smoke.
0.5;You make it sound as though \Nthe monster was resurrected.

0.5;Besides, unlike him, I have more class \Nthan to drink on the window sill.
0.5;I was abandoned by my \Nparents when I was a kid.
0.5;Which leaves the trick \Nbehind the giant monster...
0.5;Masuko-san in the room directly \Nbelow his is the most suspicious.
0.5;When Tanzawa-san was surprised by the fire \Nand stuck his head out of the window,
0.5;she could've thrust a long stick with \Npoisoned needles on the end upwards.
0.5;For some reason only one side of \Nthe window in that room would open,
0.5;so she could've predicted \Nwhere he'd stick his head out.
0.5;one bottle of white wine, one glass, and the \Nsommelier knife she requested from the mayor.
0.5;Inside Masuko-san's bag were writing \Nimplements like ball point pens,
0.5;he moved right next door to the \Nthird floor room on the end.
0.5;Maybe only one side of \NTanzawa-san's window opened
0.5;so it wouldn't block him from shooting \Na poisoned blow dart at him.
0.5;But Tsurumi-san and Tanzawa-san's \Nwindows were ten meters apart
0.5;Plus he couldn't pierce the\Nbottom of his chin from the side.
0.5;a folding knife, a selfie stick, \Ncigarettes and a lighter,
0.5;and the plastic model he said \Nhe bought to pass the time.
0.5;He didn't have anything that he \Ncould've used to poison someone.
0.5;We thought he was hungry \Nand wanted to get out,
0.5;so we made him dinner in the \Nkitchen and brought it to him.

0.5;but the lovely Yoko-chan\Nwould never murder anybody.
0.5;The owner was probably\Nactually a huge fan of Yoko-chan,
0.5;waiting for her to be alone\Nso he could attack her.
0.5;Yoko-chan's just so nice\Nthat she's protecting him.
0.5;That would mean she's helping\Na criminal avoid arrest.
0.5;Surely you can excuse \Nher for that, Inspector.
0.5;And excuse me if I have \Nan extra glass of wine.
0.5;The number of people who searched \Nthe back room the first time.
0.5;you could tell whether or not\Nthere was someone in this room,
0.5;but Yamada-san and Konoe-san \Nsearched the room together.
0.5;so that the trick they used \Nin the murder would work.
0.5;so that the trick they used \Nin the murder would work.
0.5;Y-Yamada-san is the one who said\Nwe should search the room together.
0.5;Did you think the owner \Nmight be hiding in them?
0.5;what good would having him\Nconfirm the owner wasn't here do?
0.5;The false image of the \Nowner sleeping on the couch,
0.5;Are you saying I stuffed something\Ninside the blanket then?
0.5;there was nothing he could've \Nused next to the sofa.
0.5;But what on earth are you \Ngoing to use these for?
0.5;Use a vacuum to remove the \Nair from inside the bag
0.5;That's what the owner was doing when\NI heard him running the vacuum.
0.5;Then put the vacuum bag \Nwith clothes on the sofa.
0.5;It just looks like there's a \Nblanket on the sofa, right?
0.5;Now it looks like someone \Nis sleeping under it.
0.5;He would've had enough time to do\Nthat without Konoe-san noticing
0.5;B-But Konoe-kun could've pulled \Noff that trick as well.
0.5;It proves that you used it to\Nput a hole in the vacuum bag.
0.5;using the tip of the corkscrew\Nof your sommelier knife.
0.5;the corkscrew doesn't go all \Nthe way through the cork.
0.5;Otherwise, pieces of the \Ncork get in the wine.
0.5;goes all the way through\Nold corks in expensive wines,
0.5;this restaurant doesn't \Nstock any wines like that.
0.5;Normally there is no wine on \Na sommelier knife's corkscrew,
0.5;After uncorking the wine at \NHigo-san and Yoko-chan's table,
0.5;you left it on the table \Nwithout smelling the cork.
0.5;due to the cleaning solution\Nleft over from creating it.
0.5;The cigarette butts in the men's\Nbathroom were all of the same brand,
0.5;but some were left long\Nand had the filters chewed,
0.5;An examination of the saliva \Non the filters should reveal
0.5;when you saw the phone\NHigo-san left in the bathroom,
0.5;Then you sent him an e-mail asking\Nhim to pick up additional items
0.5;to delay his return so \Nthe other staff members
0.5;would suggest that you look \Nfor him because he was late.
0.5;Sure enough, you decided \Nto look for the owner.
0.5;First you and Konoe-san \Nsearched the back room,
0.5;you opened a hole in the vacuum\Nbag so the blanket would inflate,
0.5;and took the owner's shoes \Nout from under the sofa.
0.5;Later you sent a message \Nfrom Higo-san's phone,
0.5;because you wanted to \Nmeet with him privately.
0.5;Then you pretended to search\Nfor the owner once more,
0.5;with a blanket covering \Nhis head in the back room.
0.5;as you were heading to the \Nback room to wake him,
0.5;using the phone you stole \Nwhen you murdered the owner,
0.5;so he would bring Higo-san and \NYoko-chan to the storeroom.
0.5;You removed the clothes\Nfrom the vacuum bag,
0.5;left in the back room and put \Nthem back inside the locker,
0.5;and destroyed the evidence \Nof the trick you used.
0.5;You probably went to the kitchen when\Nthe owner's body was discovered,
0.5;and gave some kickbacks \Nto the wine makers, too.
0.5;I told him customers of a former J-Leaguer's\Nrestaurant were of no importance!
0.5;They wouldn't know the \Nfirst thing about wine,
0.5;The two of us bought a watch \Nto celebrate his retirement,
0.5;Asuka-san is the first celebrity \NKonan High produced.
0.5;No, I'll be married to \Nsoccer for a while longer.
0.5;you identified the man who \Ndid that to Asuka-san.
0.5;And thanks for helping \Nsolve the case, Conan-kun.
0.5;I wish you could take \NTakahiro's place on the team.
0.5;Yeah, we're best friends \Nand brothers who love toys.
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “The\NDetective Boys Get Out of the Rain!”
0.5;As long as modern-day\Ncrimes involve people,
0.5;there are no\Nunsolvable mysteries!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;It is noteworthy as the very first\Nstory Sherlock Holmes appears in!
0.5;"""The Red-Headed League""\Nis my favorite!"
0.5;Oh! That one was\Ninternationally acclaimed!
0.5;Impressive, my boy!\NYou can read kanji?
0.5;Why do I have to\Ngo on this stupid tour?
0.5;Because Conan-kun\Napplied for you without asking...
0.5;And then I was\Nunlucky enough to get picked...
0.5;"I'd say I prefer\N""And Then There Was One."""
0.5;And that novel was\Nwritten by Agatha Christie,
0.5;I'm supposed to live with\Nthese jerks for three whole days?!
0.5;the tour director\Nis in another car,
0.5;Oh, come on.\NThe more the merrier!
0.5;Welcome, everyone,\Nto the Mycroft Lodge!
0.5;is a superior Sherlockian\Nthat I have carefully selected.
0.5;It seems a complete amateur\Nwho knows nothing about Holmes
0.5;This man I've brought\Nhere today is none other
0.5;I've seen him many a\Ntime on TV and in the papers.
0.5;I can't let them get\Naway with saying that!
0.5;"You're being compared with Holmes;\Nit's to be expected!"
0.5;I refuse to lose to a\Nstupid fictional character!
0.5;Besides, this is all because\Nyou signed me up for this tour!
0.5;I like it too!\NIsn't it a great name?!
0.5;I guess I didn't\Nneed to worry after all.
0.5;Conan-kun's usually cool\Nand strangely un-childlike.
0.5;But as I look at that innocent\Nface of his, I feel relieved.
0.5;But Conan-kun's fascination with\NHolmes is almost the same as his!
0.5;a mystery nerd,\Na Holmes freak, and is tone--
0.5;...tone-deaf, but a superb\Nhigh school soccer player,
0.5;and the guy who ran off\Nduring our contest the other day
0.5;Besides, Ellery Queen's\Nmuch better than Conan Doyle--
0.5;On second thought,\Nmaybe Doyle's better!
0.5;It's growing late,\Nso we'll call it a night.
0.5;Breakfast is tomorrow\Nmorning at 9:00,
0.5;And then after dinner is the\Nannual super-difficult mystery quiz!
0.5;And those who get a\Nperfect score on the quiz
0.5;will be presented with\NConan Doyle's greatest work
0.5;which brought Sherlock Holmes\Ninto this world--
0.5;"a first-edition copy\Nof ""A Study in Scarlet!"""
0.5;First, I must see proof of\Nhow devoted you are to Holmes!
0.5;What my maid\Nis passing out right now
0.5;is the Holmes Cult\NTest of 1000 Questions!
0.5;You have until dinner tomorrow\Nevening to turn it in.
0.5;will be able to\Nparticipate in tomorrow's quiz.
0.5;Just to be safe,\Nif you have a cell phone
0.5;please hand them\Nover to my maid now.
0.5;There's no point\Nin trying to hide them!
0.5;are security cameras\Nand listening devices!
0.5;If you're caught cheating,\Nyou will be asked to leave at once!
0.5;Hey, now. Do I have\Nto take that test too?
0.5;All I ask is that you\Ngive us a lecture later on...
0.5;Hey. If I get over 990 right,\Ncan I be in the quiz too?
0.5;"""What was the exact\Ndate that Holmes fell"
0.5;"to the bottom of the valley\Nwith Professor Moriarty?"""
0.5;"""Write down the entire code\Nfrom 'The Dancing Men'"
0.5;Are you still up?\NIt's 4 o'clock, you know.
0.5;Ugh. No TV, no phones,\Nno newspapers...
0.5;On top of that, there's\Nnot even any air-conditioning,
0.5;A single security\Ncamera is all there is.
0.5;The owner hasn't\Nshown up at all, has he?
0.5;Go get him and start\Ngrading the tests already!
0.5;But I've been told to entertain\Nyou all until he comes...
0.5;Kudo ain't here.\NI shouldn't have come on this tour...
0.5;He was lying when he\Nsaid he would give away
0.5;He finds fault in\Npeople's answers every time,
0.5;He only holds this tour\Nto show off that book of his!
0.5;This is ridiculous.\NI'm going to bed too.
0.5;Come on, Kento.\NLet's go back to our room, too.
0.5;Be patient! Making a move at\Na time like this would mean defeat!
0.5;See, the mystery\Nquiz is finally starting.
0.5;And what's that sound?!\NIt's not the engine!
0.5;He probably didn't want to\Npart with his first-edition book.
0.5;Someone put him to\Nsleep or killed him in advance,
0.5;and put the car in drive to make\Nit move forward automatically.
0.5;The killer most likely did\Nall of that inside that garage.
0.5;Then does that\Nmean one of us is the killer?!
0.5;That may be, but the car\Nsped up at one point!
0.5;There was also a strange\Nhissing sound coming from inside!
0.5;Oh, that must have\Nbeen the air conditioner!
0.5;The AC was set to on,\Nso when the engine was started
0.5;At any rate,\Nthe body is unrecoverable.
0.5;Our only choice is to\Ncontact the police and wait.
0.5;Oh? What are you\Nlooking at that tire track for?
0.5;Don't look at me!\NI was just checking to see
0.5;He also collided with me when\NI was looking for evidence
0.5;Let's take the remaining\Ncar and get out of this place--
0.5;The car in the garage\Nhad its gas tank punctured
0.5;On top of that,\Nthe battery's been removed.
0.5;It would seem the owner\Nwas killed by someone, Detective.
0.5;means that the killer still plans\Nto continue this murder drama!
0.5;If we properly investigate\Nwe'll uncover them soon enough!
0.5;Oh, yeah! The security cameras\Nmight have recorded something!
0.5;Even so,\Nwe know it was around 3:30
0.5;when the killer put the owner\Nin the car and sent him on his way.
0.5;And that it was\Nimpossible for the five of us
0.5;who had been in the living\Nroom for several hours prior
0.5;So the killer was one of us\Nfive who weren't in the living room?!
0.5;Did you find what you\Nwere looking for earlier?
0.5;I just figured out both\Nthe killer's identity and their trick.
0.5;If you don't wish to hear\Nyour name from my mouth
0.5;No! She must have found a clue\Nwe don't know about yet!
0.5;Now that you mention it, Ayako-san\Nwas acting odd this afternoon.
0.5;I ran into her on the way\Nback to my room after lunch.
0.5;But when she saw me, she quickly\Nhid some papers behind her.
0.5;I think it might've been the Holmes\Ntest that was passed out last night...
0.5;and then shut\Nherself up in the bathroom.
0.5;There were other\Npeople besides Ayako-san
0.5;Yes. Just Kento Togano-san\Nand Nanako Shimizu-san.
0.5;means that Ayako\Nknew from the very start
0.5;Did Ayako-san come\Nto your room this afternoon?
0.5;No. I did the rest\Nof the test in my room,
0.5;Which means she did\Nsee it in someone's room!
0.5;Something that one of those\Nfour alibi-less people had--
0.5;It's rude of you to gather\Naround the bathroom, you know!
0.5;Why? Why'd she suddenly\Nchange her attitude?
0.5;Darn it! And there're so\Nmany things I don't know!
0.5;but she insisted there\Nwon't be any more murders.
0.5;Well, we do have\Nall four suspects here, so...
0.5;Nothing will\Nhappen if we just stay still.
0.5;You moron! Jump into that\Nand you'll only burn to death!
0.5;Judging from her clothes and figure,\Nthere's no question it's her.
0.5;And she was perfectly\Nfine just a short while ago...
0.5;Come to think of it, she did say\Nshe figured out who the killer was...
0.5;So the killer killed\Nher to keep her quiet?
0.5;But I believe all the suspects\Nwere in the owner's lodge
0.5;when the fire erupted\Nin this garage.
0.5;He drove off the cliff,\Nbut wouldn't everything fit
0.5;Yes! If it had been a dummy\Nor something in the car, then...
0.5;I saw him too! I don't\Nthink there's any question about it!
0.5;In any case, it's painfully clear\Nthat the killer is not one of us ten.
0.5;For now, let's retreat to\Nthe house and wait until morning.
0.5;But all the suspects\Nwere in the lodge...
0.5;Could someone have put a\Ntime-activated detonator in the garage?
0.5;What was Ayako-san doing\Nin the garage, anyway?
0.5;If this downpour keeps up,\Nthere's no leaving come morning...
0.5;Shall I make some coffee\Nand something cold to eat?
0.5;I'd be worried if you two\Ngirls were all by yourselves.
0.5;why would he pretend\Nto die and then kill Ayako-san?
0.5;Had I not been careful\NI would've been killed!
0.5;"""If you want the book, then come\Nto the garage at 5 a.m. tomorrow."
0.5;It was past 4:30 when\Nthe fire started in the garage...
0.5;The back seat?\NThat's where Ayako's body was!
0.5;It was stuck in my door when\NI returned from dinner last night.
0.5;How many times do I have to say it?!\NThe owner was dead!
0.5;it would seem that she, too,\Nwent to the garage to get the book.
0.5;Which means the only remaining\Nmystery of the second incident
0.5;is how the killer lit the garage\Non fire while still in the room.
0.5;My dad solves his\Ncases every single time!
0.5;He takes a sleeping-like pose\Nwhenever he analyzes things,
0.5;"so everyone fears\Nhim as ""Sleeping Kogoro""!"
0.5;You know, the one who's\Nalways hangin' around you guys...
0.5;Now that you mention it,\Nhe never is around...
0.5;Oh, but he often\Nappears from behind my dad
0.5;Then hurry and reset\Nthe circuit breakers!
0.5;Dammit! They smashed\Nthe window and escaped!
0.5;And now I finally know how\Nthe killer set the garage on fire
0.5;Perhaps the third incident\Nwasn't part of the killer's plan?
0.5;But I'm just a kid,\Nso what would I know?
0.5;This kid isn't pretending\Nto be a detective!
0.5;His voice and body are different,\Nbut he's almost like Shinichi Kudo!
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;But it started raining \Nthe second we got there.
0.5;Why don't we play games \Nat the professor's house?
0.5;Speaking of games, how far \Ndid you get in Titan Hunter?
0.5;"what ""sister from \Nanother domain"" means?"
0.5;Sera seems to be hiding a middle-school-aged \Ngirl who looks just like her in a hotel.
0.5;It's been on my mind, so I e-mailed \Nher about the girl yesterday.
0.5;"She responded, ""She's a \Nsister from another domain."""
0.5;The things you picked up\Nthat looked like tea leaves
0.5;It's no big deal that your \Nfingerprints are on the bag.
0.5;No, there's something small \Nwritten on the edge of the page.
0.5;The letter E, the number \N2, an circled number 2,
0.5;"and the character ""ma"" \Nfor ""mayaku"" or drugs."
0.5;"It looks like there was something \Nwritten after the ""ma,"""
0.5;"All that can be barely read from the blurred \Nlines are the ""ma"" from the first page,"
0.5;"the third line's ""tsuki,"" the fifth line's \N""Nihon,"" and the ninth line's ""Kyobashi."""
0.5;"And what about the ""tsuki"" and \N""Nippon"" written after them?"
0.5;Holding onto it won't do any good, \Nso I'll turn it in at a police box.
0.5;I just remembered I have something \Nto do. I'm going home.
0.5;It looks like the only ones \Nhere are these kids
0.5;You're conducting an \Ninvestigation, aren't you?
0.5;are probably the dates and \Nlocations of various drug deal.
0.5;The biggest clue is these notes \Nwritten in water-based ink,
0.5;The dealer's fingertips were stained with \Nink the same color as these blurred notes,
0.5;It's natural to assume it was whoever \Nhe's conducting the deals with.
0.5;His trading partner probably sent \Nthe dealer the code-filled notebooks,
0.5;and conducted trades by indicating \Nthe location and date.
0.5;He taught only the dealer \Nhow to decipher the code,
0.5;so no one else could figure it out \Neven if they saw the notebook.
0.5;Then the water-based ink \Nnotes written by that man...
0.5;The dealer wrote the answers \Nto the code on the side.
0.5;He probably meant to burn \Nor throw it away later.
0.5;"In other words, the code E22 \Nis associated with ""ma,"""
0.5;"Y21 with ""tsuki,"" and \N""G11"" with ""Nihon."""
0.5;I realized immediately that they \Nwere subway and station numbers.
0.5;E22 is the Oedo Line's \Nstation 22, Azabu Juban.
0.5;Y21 is the Yurakucho Line's \Nstation 21, Tsukishima.
0.5;They're the circled letters and numbers \Ndisplayed next to a station's name.
0.5;Which means you're meant \Nto read only the character
0.5;"and the third character is Azabu \NJuban is the character ""ju."""
0.5;"If you read the code up to the fifth line \Nfollowing that rule, E22 is ""ju."""
0.5;"Y21 is the Yurakucho Line's \NTsukishima, so it's ""tsuki."""
0.5;"M09 is the Marunouchi Line's Shinjuku \NSanchome, so it's ""san."""
0.5;"G11 is the Ginza Line's \NNihonbashi, so it's ""hi."""
0.5;If you read them in order, \Nyou get December 3rd.
0.5;but I can't decipher the \Nsix lines below the date.
0.5;The sixth line's N11 is the \NNanboku Line's Korakuen.
0.5;"The second number's circled, \Nso it's ""raku."""
0.5;The seventh line's Y12 is the \NYurakucho Line's Edogawabashi.
0.5;"The second number's circled \Nhere, too, so it's ""do."""
0.5;The eighth line's H02 is \Nthe Hibiya Line's Ebisu.
0.5;"The entire thing is circled, \Nso it's ""Ebisu."""
0.5;And what's the arrow attached \Nto the circle around Ebisu?
0.5;The stations next to Ebisu \Nare Nakameguro and Hiroo,
0.5;"I02 is the Mita Line's Shirokanedai, \Nso it's ""shiro."""
0.5;"T22 is the Tozai Line's Baraki-Nakayama, \Nso it's ""bara."""
0.5;The Chiyoda Line ends with \Nstation 20, Kitahayase.
0.5;The kids called me since you \Nwere on the verge of tears
0.5;I'll send it to you right \Nnow. Give me a second.
0.5;Nihonbashi and Kyobashi \Nare Tokyo subway stations,
0.5;Nipponbashi and Kyobashi are the \Nnames of Osaka subway stations, too.
0.5;On top of that, there are a \Nfew stations between them.
0.5;H-Hey, is there really a \NKyobashi over there, too?
0.5;then this code that uses line and station \Nnumbers isn't limited to one region.
0.5;"But that means the ""December 3rd"" \NI deciphered from the first five lines"
0.5;In Osaka, we've got tons of stations \Nwith numbers in their names
0.5;like Higashi-Mikuni, Yotsubashi, \NTanimachi Rokuchome.
0.5;It looks like only Osaka and Tokyo have \Na Nipponbashi and Kyobashi, though.
0.5;Hey, some of the codes \Nare aligned to the left
0.5;Then maybe one side indicates Tokyo stations \Nand the other indicates Osaka stations.
0.5;then it would natural to assume the \Nwestern city of Osaka is the left,
0.5;All five lines you deciphered are on \Nthe left, so you're totally wrong.
0.5;Our Nipponbashi is the Sakaisuji Line's \NK17 and the Sennichimae Line's S17.
0.5;It's a book with Tokyo \Nline and subway numbers.
0.5;I walked all the way down to a store \Non the Shinsaibashi station platform.
0.5;The escalator was out of service, \Nso I had to use the stairs.
0.5;in Osaka we stand to the right \Nand leave the left side open,
0.5;but it's the other way \Naround in Tokyo, right?
0.5;The stations aligned to the \Nright are Osaka stations,
0.5;and the ones aligned to the \Nleft are Tokyo stations.
0.5;That's why the codes were \Nwritten on the edges of pages.
0.5;If you read them all at \Nonce, they look like stairs.
0.5;N11 is the Nagahori \NTsurumi-Ryokuchi Line's Taisho.
0.5;"The second number's circled in both \Ncodes, so it's ""sho"" and ""go."""
0.5;then we'd better hurry up and \Nhide before they get here!
0.5;"H02 is aligned to the \Nleft, so it's ""Ebisu."""
0.5;If N22 is Osaka's Kyobashi, then the deal \Nis probably happening at Ebisubashi.
0.5;But I don't know why there's an arrow \Nattached to the circle around H02.
0.5;but there's a bridge called Ebisubashi \Nwhere we meet all the time!
0.5;"The right-aligned C22 is Osaka's Chuo \NLine's Takaida, so it's ""i."""
0.5;The left-aligned I02 and T22 are Tokyo's \NShirokanedai and Haraki-Nakayama,
0.5;"Read them together, and \Nyou get ""shiroihara."""
0.5;Surely it doesn't mean he'll be waiting \Nwith his white stomach hanging out.
0.5;"In other words, when you read them \Ntogether, you get ""shiroibara."""
0.5;Maybe he tried to catch the dealer's \Ntrading partner, and instead...
0.5;but there are three people \Nwearing or holding white roses,
0.5;You should've told me you \Narrived at the bridge.
0.5;There really were a few suspicious \Ncharacters, so I got lost in thought.
0.5;But are you sure there's a \Ndrug deal happening here?
0.5;The guy holding this notebook \Nhad four huge bags of marijuana.
0.5;so it's likely he meant to \Nexchange all of them at once.
0.5;I did consider the possibility \Nthe deal had already happened...
0.5;It was a bearded man wearing \Na knit hat and jacket.
0.5;It's also possible he escaped \Nand headed your way,
0.5;It looks like we'll have to narrow down \Nhis trading partner to one before then.
0.5;I'll throw the lot of you \Ninto the Dotonbori River!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Conan \Nand Heiji's Code of Love, Part Two!"""
0.5;We were watching the back door since \Nwe expected passers-by out front.
0.5;Ihaya, Agata, and I headed \Nto the bathroom together.
0.5;Ihaya said he was worried about \Nleaving Keiko-chan alone in the room,
0.5;I thought I saw him check his \Nmessages before he headed back.
0.5;I was afraid to stay alone in the room, so \NI left for the bathroom shortly afterwards.
0.5;It's possible he returned \Nafter I left the room.
0.5;My stomach wasn't feeling great, so \NI stayed in the bathroom for a while.
0.5;In other words, all three of \Nyou could've messaged Ihaya-san
0.5;but the blood spray and \Nfootprints on the inuyarai...
0.5;It looks like they were \Npainted on quite a while ago.
0.5;When you were here before \Nthe body was discovered,

0.5;"This character is the ""hisashi"" \Nin the Kamigyo Ward's Hisashi-cho."
0.5;"To its left is the ""to"" in the \NShimogyo Ward's Tokusayama-cho."
0.5;"To the left of that is the ""adashi"" \Nin the Ukyo Ward's Adashino."
0.5;If there are wards with top, bottom, \Nand right in their names, then...
0.5;Kyoto contains the Kamigyo Ward, the \NNakagyo Ward, the Shimogyo Ward,
0.5;Top, middle, bottom, and left \Nand right are all represented.
0.5;Are you going to clean the \Nclassroom yourself, Kazuha?
0.5;I believe we were in the \Nmiddle of our conversation.
0.5;about the man named Dekuri who \Ncame up with these three ciphers.
0.5;The tengu and the movie share \Na surprising connection!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Was he also your classmate \Nat Gion Art School?
0.5;He was in fine arts, but \NI was a music student.
0.5;How did you get to know each other \Nwhen you studied different majors?
0.5;Every year, we'd show the movie \Nwe filmed at the school festival.
0.5;Ihaya-kun and I were masters \Nof special effects makeup.
0.5;And I'd compose eerie music \Nfor the completed film.
0.5;and Dekuri would design the \Ncostumes and monsters, right?
0.5;Agata-kun was the only one who \Nwas really useful, though.
0.5;But the name Dekuri doesn't \Nappear in the credits
0.5;Nishiki was having trouble writing the \Nscript for our graduation project.
0.5;Dekuri-kun said he planned \Nto officially publish it
0.5;once he became a \Nprofessional comic book artist,
0.5;We thought Dekuri would accept it \Nonce he saw the finished product,
0.5;But when he previewed the \Nfilm in our club room...
0.5;Later, our graduation project \Nreceived high praise.
0.5;The five of us were thrown \Ninto the limelight.
0.5;He said he'd given up on drawing comics \Nand was working at a small design firm.
0.5;Dekuri-kun said it was his dream for his \Ncomics to be adapted for the big screen.
0.5;We were going to, but there \Nwas a little mistake.
0.5;When he saw his name wasn't in the \Ncredits at the first screening,
0.5;We even thought about canceling \Nthe movie's release,
0.5;Why are Heiji-kun and the others \Nallowed inside when we're not?
0.5;The little leaf left me to \Nlook after Heiji for once.
0.5;He seems to have the trust \Nof Inspector Ayanokoji.
0.5;is probably practicing \Nin the dojo around now.
0.5;If you have a message for \Nhim, I'll deliver it for you.
0.5;So you did come to Kyoto \Nbecause you wanted to see me.
0.5;After all she went through over \Nher college graduation project,
0.5;"she added the character for sun to \Nthe top of ""kyo"" for ""Kyoto,"""
0.5;"Mayama-san changed the mountain radical of \N""mine"" in ""Mineto"" from left to top,"
0.5;and Nishiki-san changed his \Nname from Taro to Tarobo.
0.5;Come to think of it, Japan's most \Nlegendary tengu is named Tarobo, too.
0.5;she fell in love during college \Nand hasn't gotten married
0.5;When Nishiki-san tried to \Nreserve a smoking room,
0.5;at first they told him \Nthey were fully booked,
0.5;but a reservation was canceled while he was \Non the phone, so he got a room after all.
0.5;A reservation was canceled while we \Nwere on the phone with Nishiki-sama.
0.5;He reserved the room for two \Ndays starting yesterday.
0.5;Come to think of it, you \Nsmoke, too, Agata-san.
0.5;Someone else canceled right \Nafter Nishiki called.
0.5;We were gathered in Nishiki's apartment \Nand made our reservations together.
0.5;someone else canceled, and \NAgata-sama reserved the room.
0.5;Is it true that nothing strange \Nwas found in the room after that?
0.5;There was a glue-like substance \Non the burned ceiling,
0.5;but it wasn't nearly enough \Nto support a large object.
0.5;and a roughly three centimeter \Nburn in the carpet
0.5;when a cigarette fell from the \Nashtray thrown at the tengu.
0.5;And for some reason, there was another \Npillow in the middle of the bed.
0.5;My legs cramp up if I don't \Nput a pillow under them.
0.5;What is it? Something in \Nthat didn't sound right.
0.5;I can't focus on the case because I \Nkeep thinking of that picture of them.
0.5;I don't have time to think \Nabout that right now.
0.5;B-But there's not enough \Nevidence to arrest them.
0.5;Could I get s-some assistance \Nfrom the Kyoto police?
0.5;the culprit may be planning \Nto kill another one of you.
0.5;Please remain in your rooms \Nuntil it's time to check out.
0.5;we'll be posting an officer \Noutside each of your rooms.
0.5;Of course. You're the \None who wrote the story.
0.5;We need to leave.\NThey're closing the theater.
0.5;No matter how long I wait, \Nmy name never appears.
0.5;Agata, how long are you \Ngoing to make me wait?
0.5;You just sent me a message saying \Nyou killed Nishiki and Ihaya,
0.5;and wanted to talk to \Nme at the Kiyomizu butai
0.5;in my despair, I threw myself from the \NKiyomizu butai and killed myself.
0.5;by four black squares at \Nthe top of the ciphers.
0.5;These refer to the Kamigyo, \NNakagyo, Shimogyo, Sakyo,
0.5;The rest of the characters are \Nparts of location names in Kyoto.
0.5;Comparing them against the positions \Nof the characters in the white cross
0.5;tells you which location name they \Nrefer to and how to read them.
0.5;If you string the first mora \Nin each character together,
0.5;"The backwards character for ""saki"" \Nthat appears occasionally"
0.5;"is the ""pon"" from \NNakagyo Ward's Ponto-cho."
0.5;"If you flip them around, you get ""nop,"" \Nso you read it as just ""n."""
0.5;"""I will kill three, starting \Nwith the scriptwriter."""
0.5;If you read the second cipher found \Non Nishiki-san's body in the same way,
0.5;"you get ""two more to \Nkill, next is the star."""
0.5;"""one more to kill, then \NI'll fall from the butai."""
0.5;After making Mayama-san's \Ndeath look like a suicide,
0.5;you probably intended to announce you \Nfigured out how to read the code,
0.5;making it look like the third cipher \Nwas Mayama-san's suicide note,
0.5;but because you wrote where \Nyou'd commit suicide,
0.5;A human couldn't have done \Nthat in less than ten minutes!
0.5;By using static electricity, they can be \Nstuck to any wall or object without an adhesive.
0.5;You started by staying in \Nthat room the day before
0.5;and painting the blood spray and footprints \Non the ceiling, allowing them to dry.
0.5;You hid them by covering the entire \Nceiling with electrostatic notes.
0.5;Naturally, you reserved that smoking \Nroom for the next day as well.
0.5;and canceled your reservation \Nfor the room painted with blood...
0.5;allowing you to force Nishiki-san \Nto stay in that room.
0.5;you ran a rod over the \Nceiling to remove the notes
0.5;and scattered Nishiki-san's script among \Nthem in order to conceal your trick.
0.5;Then you sucked some of Nishiki-san's \Nblood into a syringe
0.5;and sprayed it at the center of the \Nblood spray you painted on the ceiling.
0.5;What about the giant tengu \Nthat suddenly appeared
0.5;You were the only one who was useful when \Nyou helped Dekuri-san with his comics.
0.5;Surely you were artistic and \Ndexterous enough to build
0.5;If you made it using the \Nflash paper magicians use,
0.5;just being exposed to the flame of a \Ncigarette would make it go up in flames.
0.5;The three centimeter cigarette \Nburn left in your room proves it.
0.5;and waited to throw your ashtray at the \Ntengu after we arrived and opened the door
0.5;then it doesn't make sense for so much \Nof your cigarette to have remained.
0.5;you lit your cigarette just \Nbefore we opened the door,
0.5;even though you should have been too \Nsurprised by the tengu to do that.
0.5;on the inuyarai present at \NIhaya-san's murder during the night,
0.5;After killing him, you removed that \Ninuyarai, revealing the footprints,
0.5;Apparently they found all kinds \Nof stuff under that inuyarai,
0.5;like the murder weapon and a raincoat \Ncovered in the victim's blood.
0.5;so you could make it look like \NMayama-san did it, though.
0.5;All that's here are these \Nclear electrostatic notes
0.5;If you layered notes the same color \Nas the floorboards over them,
0.5;Because you attached nylon string to \Nthem and removed them one at a time,
0.5;it looked to Mayama-san like the bloody \Nfootprints were approaching him.
0.5;Additionally, you used \Nthis directional speaker
0.5;Since you probably planned \Nto retrieve the notes
0.5;and speaker during the commotion \Ncaused by his suicide,
0.5;He asked the Kyoto police to \Nwear their old school uniforms
0.5;when he copied the good man \Nand was given two bumps.
0.5;When I saw the bumps \NKeiko got during filming,
0.5;that Dekuri sat stunned in \Nthe theater, they said,
0.5;but instead of removing someone's name, they \Njust adjusted the spacing of some characters.
0.5;They only invited Dekuri to the \Nscreening so they could laugh at him!
0.5;They had to fix the spacing \Nof the characters!
0.5;These are the credits that were \Nsupposed to appear after the movie.
0.5;We had all five of our \Nnames displayed at once,
0.5;so the name Dekuri Michio \Nwould appear with ours.
0.5;We wanted his name to appear as \Nthe author of the original work,
0.5;but our producers said they \Ncouldn't pay another staff member,
0.5;Since he loved ciphers so \Nmuch, we thought he'd notice.
0.5;We did the same thing in \Nour graduation project.
0.5;Kiyomizu Temple trembled with the \Nremorseful wail of the killer,
0.5;You haven't forgotten that I confessed \Nmy feelings to you in London—
0.5;You haven't forgotten that I confessed \Nmy feelings to you in London—
0.5;What? A high school student \Nwho had a hard time walking?
0.5;Yeah, a male high school \Nstudent who looks like this.
0.5;I don't look at every student \Nwho comes through here.
0.5;If you're looking for Kudo, \Nhe just went running that way.
0.5;I've got underwear and other \Nstuff you shouldn't see in there!
0.5;Huh? There's a Teitan uniform \Npoking out of your bag.
0.5;Are you sure that snaggle-toothed \Ngirl doesn't know your true identity?
0.5;Also, he'd prefer to keep his \Ninvolvement in the case secret,
0.5;so he asks that you not \Nmention it on social media!
0.5;I was going to ask him about \Nthe case on the way back.
0.5;I can't believe that wannabe \Ndetective actually left.
0.5;Also, Shinichi knew that \NI met with Okita-kun.
0.5;I sent Shinichi-kun a picture \Nof your clandestine meeting.
0.5;We were talking after I \Ndelivered something to him.
0.5;She said you dropped it \Nduring the kendo tournament.
0.5;I left that charm on the desk \Nat the detective agency,
0.5;It's probably a picture of \Nthat detective kid or...
0.5;I'll never hear the end \Nof it if she finds out.
0.5;because you were frustrated \Nwith your unreliable husband?
0.5;But I'm really glad I got to hear \Nyour response to my confession.
0.5;There seems to be a medicine \Nthat can restore your body, Mom.
0.5;Then we'll do whatever it takes to \Nfind the inventor of this medicine,
0.5;Once I'm back in my old body, \Nno more running around.
0.5;Don't play with your phone \Nwhile we're driving.
0.5;I-If you weren't watching, \Ndon't worry about it.
0.5;I definitely didn't see you and that \Ngirl smooching at the Kiyomizu butai.
0.5;The Kiyomizu butai was next on my list of \Nbreathtaking places to confess my feelings.
0.5;The killer's motive was the suicide \Nof the man Kyoko-chan loved.
0.5;By the way, how did you know \NDekuri Michio-kun's name?
0.5;I thought there might be some reason \Nyour actress friend changed her name.
0.5;If you cover the top and bottom of \Nthese unevenly spaced characters...
0.5;Since the poster was made \Nafter the first screening,
0.5;it's possible Dekuri-kun \Nwouldn't have killed himself
0.5;and Agata-kun wouldn't have killed \Nanybody if they'd seen it.
0.5;The problem is how Shinichi, \Nthe boy who shouldn't exist,
0.5;somehow solved this internationally \Nnewsworthy case.
0.5;Shin-chan's really thorough \Nwhen it comes to that.
0.5;When we get to Tokyo, \Nyou're buying me a steak.
0.5;I shouldn't have offered \Nto take you back to Tokyo.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;The victim is a serial blackmailer \Nnamed Unmo Sadakazu-san.
0.5;but he most likely died instantly when he \Nwas hit over the head with a metal pipe.
0.5;Compared to how cold it is in \NTokyo, this place is paradise!
0.5;The old man got free \Nhotel vouchers somewhere.
0.5;Ran was unable to come, so \Nhe made me come with him.
0.5;So the estimated time of death \Nis today between 3:30 to 4:30.
0.5;That's when the tall man wearing \Nsunglasses and a mask came out.
0.5;And you kids were watching this construction \Nsite from across the street then?
0.5;It was regarding her grandson \Nwho lives with her.
0.5;but lately he's being going out in the \Nevening and staying out until morning.
0.5;That idiot is out gallivanting around \Nwhen he doesn't even have a job.
0.5;We should catch him while he's out \Nfooling around and advise him to stop.
0.5;We were curious about what \Nhappened, but then...
0.5;The man you kids saw certainly \Nsounds suspicious,
0.5;Unmo-san himself looks to \Nbe almost two meters tall.
0.5;It seems Unmo-san had no \Nrelationship with his neighbors.
0.5;The culprit was being blackmailed \Nby that Unmo guy, too.
0.5;So they lied about paying him, asked \Nto meet him here, and killed him.
0.5;Right. We believe the culprit \Ntook it with them.
0.5;But the man who fled wasn't \Ncarrying a metal pipe, right?
0.5;Yeah, sorry. Stick with the police \Nand tell me everything you learn.
0.5;It's a list of the people \Nhe was blackmailing.
0.5;If we encounter the suspect, we \Nmay be able to recall something.
0.5;If that's true, then they would've \Nnoticed him running unnaturally.
0.5;We're sorry to have bothered \Nyou on your day off.
0.5;Maybe that person was \Nactually a masculine woman.
0.5;I was in my apartment \Nyesterday afternoon, right?
0.5;That's because you didn't \Nsee the body, Conan-kun.
0.5;Very well. I can't refuse a \Nrequest from you, Mori-san.
0.5;Were his front teeth knocked \Nout when he was hit?
0.5;They're dentures. We found \Nthem in his apartment.
0.5;He was going to have them put \Nback in at the start of the week.
0.5;I was just curious. Sorry \Nto have bothered you.
0.5;Anyway, the real problem is \Nall the suspects are innocent.
0.5;Why can't we find the man who \Nkilled this person and fled?
0.5;That's when you guys saw the \Ntall man running away, right?
0.5;That's when you guys saw the \Ntall man running away, right?
0.5;I even have some idea of \Nwhy the culprit did that.
0.5;According to Mitsuhiko, all \Nthe suspects have alibis.
0.5;Mitsuhiko, sorry. I want you guys \Nto split up and do something for me.
0.5;The first is to confirm her \Nalibi with the witness.
0.5;He's ordering us around \Nwithout even explaining why?
0.5;And Conan's always making \Nus run errands for him.
0.5;But this time he gave us \Norders over the phone.
0.5;Why not? It's up to us to find \Nthe key to solving the case.
0.5;But I'd better give Edogawa-kun \Na piece of my mind first.
0.5;Did I visit my neighbor Samei \NRika-san's apartment yesterday?
0.5;Then how did you know she \Nstarted working at three?
0.5;Oh, because she came to ask \Nme for something yesterday.
0.5;If someone knocks on or \Nyells outside my door,
0.5;She made her request and went back \Ninto her apartment around three.
0.5;I was in my apartment \Nyesterday afternoon, right?
0.5;He just said to thoroughly search \Nthe area around the crime scene.
0.5;but why did they leave their \Ncoat and other belongings?
0.5;He figured it out based on \Nthe information we gave him.
0.5;There's nothing wrong with \Nhaving some backbone.
0.5;but you can't say the same, \Ncan you, Samei Rika-san?
0.5;You're right, but it doesn't \Nmatter if I have an alibi.
0.5;More importantly, why \Ncouldn't you have found him?
0.5;The tall man wearing sunglasses, \Na mask, and coat
0.5;Unmo-san came to the construction \Nsite to blackmail someone.
0.5;In other words, the tall man \Nthe Detective Boys saw
0.5;Believing he had killed them, he \Nthrew away the metal pipe and fled,
0.5;He must've remembered that his \Nfingerprints were on the weapon.
0.5;Unmo-san was killed by \Nhis blackmailing victim,
0.5;The reason I thought the tall \Nman they saw might be Unmo-san
0.5;Since it was a cold day, he \Nmust've been wearing a coat,
0.5;he would've hidden the fact that his \Nfront teeth were missing with a mask.
0.5;"Once we eliminate the \Nrequirement of ""tall man,"""
0.5;we should be focusing on the \Ncertainty of their alibis
0.5;Why did the culprit need \Nto remove Unmo-san's coat?
0.5;it's possible their blood \Ngot on Unmo-san's clothes.
0.5;Forensics just reported that \Nthey found blood on the coat.
0.5;It belongs to the victim \NUnmo-san and one other person.
0.5;He asked me to meet him \Nyesterday and blackmailed me.
0.5;In order to defend myself, \NI grabbed a metal pipe,
0.5;It's thanks to the information \Nyou provided me.
0.5;So this is what he meant when he \Nsaid we were his only visitors.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Sun Sets Over Tangerine Fields!"""
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut cases are even more so!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Ayumi-chan! Mitsuhiko!\NGenta! Here we go!
0.5;Hey, now.... you're bragging\Na little too much...
0.5;You can count on the\NJunior Detective League!
0.5;Go treat the kiddos to\Na meal or something, Mori-kun!
0.5;Bah. There goes all my\Nspending money for this month.
0.5;You're amazing! He was\Nwanted for fifty different robberies!
0.5;Conan-kun found him! He seemed\Nsuspicious in the jewelry shop!
0.5;Ran! You stay here! I'm going to\Nget the police and an ambulance!
0.5;It stops at every turn...\NAlmost as if it's waiting for us!
0.5;Hey! What're you\Ndoing, Conan?! Go faster!
0.5;There are stairs this way.\NWhich means...!
0.5;There's a cigarette shop!\NLet's ask there!
0.5;Lady! Did a red car\Njust pass by here?!
0.5;I'm not sure. A couple\Ncars did pass by, but...
0.5;Hey, we've been\Nhere three minutes now.
0.5;The person is\Nlong gone by now...
0.5;Its engine stalled again!\NWe're lucky!
0.5;No! It's different from before!\NIt wasn't there earlier!
0.5;Did it back up or something?!\NWhat for?!
0.5;Officer, please arrest me.\NI committed a hit-and-run.
0.5;but he decided to turn\Nhimself in after the guilt got to him.
0.5;I wanted the Junior Detective\NLeague to use more of its might!
0.5;They said she doesn't\Nneed to be hospitalized.
0.5;No, it isn't. I lost the Detective\NLeague badge Conan-kun gave me.
0.5;Don't worry! I can have\Nthe Doc make another one!
0.5;Really?! I'm so happy!\NThat's why I like you, Conan-kun!
0.5;Buying her love with objects...\NYou coward!
0.5;Hey, you kids! Come with\Nme to the factory on 4th Street!
0.5;The factory on 4th Street?\NThat's the place we passed by earlier.
0.5;Getting right to the point,\Nhere's the situation.
0.5;Yes, we're investigating\Nit as a robbery murder.
0.5;but Ishikura-san was apparently\Nhere alone, checking the products.
0.5;There are tape marks on\Nhis mouth and wrist.
0.5;But why bother\Nremoving the tape? The killer--
0.5;The back door is diagonal\Nfrom the cigarette lady's shop...
0.5;We'll have to wait\Nfor the autopsy for details,
0.5;We were focused on\Nfollowing the hit-and-run man...
0.5;See?! The guy in\Nthe back, near the middle!
0.5;Who'd commit a robbery murder\Nwhile running from a hit-and-run?!
0.5;and my car stalled on the curve \Na little ways behind the factory.
0.5;I never stopped the car behind\Nthe factory, nor did I murder anyone.
0.5;He used to work at that factory,\Nand was let go due to his misconduct.
0.5;We were in front of the\Nfactory when it happened!
0.5;He could've used the back door\Nwhile he was out of the kids' sight!
0.5;Yes, but we spoke with the cigarette\Nshop lady behind the factory.
0.5;No cars stopped near here.\NNot behind the factory or on the street.
0.5;No! There's another\Nside to these two incidents!
0.5;Come on, let's go visit\NAyumi-chan!
0.5;No! The Junior Detective League\Nmust always work as a team!
0.5;There's some juice over there!\NBy the cigarette shop!
0.5;Oh, now that you mention it,\Nthere had been two wrong numbers...
0.5;Could you hurry down\Nto the factory on 4th Street?
0.5;Oh, you can be considerate!\NDon't mind if I do...
0.5;I wish I could've\Nhad at least one sip first...
0.5;He became Sleeping Kogoro\Nthe instant he entered the crime scene!
0.5;Didn't even notice we just\Nfilled an empty can with water!
0.5;Conan told me everything.\NI'll handle things from here.
0.5;Don't worry. I've made sure\Nyou'll be in the spotlight, too.
0.5;You then continued to drive,\Nwith those children in pursuit,
0.5;...by this factory owned by Ishikura-san,\Nwhom you know and hate.
0.5;Ishikura-san's killer was you,\NShishido-san!
0.5;He was deemed innocent\Nfor the murder, at the very least!
0.5;It was believed that he couldn't have\Ncommitted it while fleeing,
0.5;Yeah! You even have\Nsomeone to vouch for me!
0.5;What if you intended for these children,\Nthe Junior Detective League,
0.5;In short, what if Ayumi-kun's\Nhit-and-run incident
0.5;Y-You can't be serious!\NIs that possible?!
0.5;According to Conan, the car would\Nunnaturally stop at each turn,
0.5;If he was doing this so they could\Nfollow him, that would explain it.
0.5;The car's spark plugs were worn\Nand its engine was in bad condition.
0.5;Even an amateur\Ncould set that up, Inspector.
0.5;Okay, then. Even if that were the case,\NI have an alibi. A perfect one.
0.5;No, it would've been\Nmore than enough to enter here.
0.5;The cigarette lady would've\Nseen my car stopped by the back door!
0.5;I worked here.\NIt's only natural that I know.
0.5;Then you must naturally\Nknow that shop's phone number, too.
0.5;You couldn't stop the car by\Nthe back door. You walked here.
0.5;Then what about the car?\NHow did it disappear?
0.5;Show the inspector to the warehouse\Nyou lifted me up to look into!
0.5;Why does a car exactly like\Nthe hit-and run car exist here?!
0.5;You worked at a sheet metal\Nand painting factory, Shishido-san.
0.5;First, you knocked Ishikura-san\Nout with a sedative or something,
0.5;then tied him up with\Ntape and left him there.
0.5;You then took the modified\Ncar and committed the hit-and-run.
0.5;You stopped the car occasionally\Nso the children could follow you,
0.5;Next, you called the cigarette\Nlady on your cell phone,
0.5;passed by while her\Nback was to the road,
0.5;and entered the office\Nthrough the back door.
0.5;You quickly murdered Ishikura-san,\Nremoved the tape,
0.5;The safe was probably\Nput in disarray in advance.
0.5;When leaving the office,\Nyou called the cigarette shop lady again.
0.5;You then hurried to the\Nother hidden car, took it out,
0.5;Of course, this one was your real\Ncar with your real license plate,
0.5;that you had tinkered with\Nin advance to be in bad shape.
0.5;I've heard enough! My car was\Ntaken in after the hit-and-run!
0.5;Detective Takagi. Was there any\Nmud on the car taken into custody?
0.5;Hey, you! Is there\Nany mud on that car?!
0.5;Oh! Yes!\NThere is, near the bottom!
0.5;What does that matter?!\NThe mud came off my car while driving!
0.5;Detective! If you're claiming that's\Nthe hit-and-run car, then prove it!
0.5;Hey, Mitsuhiko! Call\NAyumi-chan with your badge!
0.5;Respond if you do. This is\NMitsuhiko. How are you feeling?
0.5;It fell out of her pocket and got\Nstuck to it during the hit-and-run!
0.5;we were supposed to meet \Nmurdered in a hotel room.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;did Hotta-san order this wine \Nwhile staying in this room?
0.5;It's chilly today, but not cold \Nenough to turn on the heat.
0.5;If the killer were trying to \Ndisguise the time of death,
0.5;they would've turned up the heat \Nin the bedroom where the body is,
0.5;but it's cold in here because \Nthe windows were left open.
0.5;Mori-kun, are you sure you saw \Nsomeone run from that window?
0.5;Come to think of it, there was a gust \Nof wind when we opened the door.
0.5;That's probably because I \Nhad the front door open.
0.5;But the glasses fell when \Nthe front door was opened,
0.5;Was that bellhop here \Nwhen you found the body?
0.5;but nobody answered when \Nwe rang the doorbell.
0.5;Then Kokuri-san noticed he received \Nan e-mail from Hotta-san
0.5;Then he went to get a bellhop \Nto unlock the door for us.
0.5;Was that a clear enough explanation \Nfor your mystery person?
0.5;More importantly, I want to see \Nwhat's above the balcony window.
0.5;So you found signs something \Nwas stuck above the window.
0.5;and set to blow away when \Nthe door was opened.
0.5;But I don't think the wind would've \Nbeen enough to unstick something.
0.5;Even if it did, the object that was \Nblown away should be around somewhere.
0.5;the toilet lid opened on \Nits own and surprised me.
0.5;Sorry. It took a while \Nto explain the situation.
0.5;There's a car parked \Ndirectly below the balcony.
0.5;Now that forensics is finished, \Nthere's nothing left to see.
0.5;This'll be a little sketchy \Nsince Sera's here.
0.5;Now I just have to use my \Nbow tie-shaped voice changer
0.5;I dropped my bow tie-shaped \Nvoice changer somewhere.
0.5;The Sleeping Kogoro can't \Nsolve the case without it.
0.5;of the periodically repeated \Nloss of consciousness.
0.5;In other words, it's practically impossible \Nfor a person to speak while sleeping.
0.5;who has solved this ridiculous \Ncase, I ask that you listen.
0.5;I prefer to be brief, \Nso I'll start at the end.
0.5;and made it seem as though \Nthe killer fled the scene
0.5;B-But you said the wine glasses and plates \Nfell when you opened the front door,
0.5;from the balcony when you \Nopened the bedroom door.
0.5;but the odds the utensils \Nwould've fallen were 50-50,
0.5;I brought a wine glass, a bottle \Nof wine, a plate, and salt.
0.5;Detective Mori said he needed \Nthem for the investigation.
0.5;First, set the plate on \Nthe very edge of the table.
0.5;Then pour a large amount of salt next to \Nthe plate towards the center of the table.
0.5;Once the glass is on the \Ntable, blow the salt away.
0.5;Just weakly enough that \Nthe glass doesn't fall.
0.5;The glass is being held up \Nby just a few grains of salt.
0.5;The glass and plate fall \Non the floor together.
0.5;If you place broken plates and \Nglasses under the table beforehand,
0.5;the falling objects will break and \Nmake a noise when they strike them.
0.5;and creating wine-stained footprints \Nleading to the bedroom,
0.5;you made it appear as though the \Nkiller ran into the bedroom.
0.5;Furthermore, you created a \Ndifference in temperature
0.5;between this room and the \Nbedroom by turning on the heat,
0.5;so when the bedroom door was opened, \Na breeze would blow through,
0.5;You feared your trick would be discovered \Nif the police found piles of salt
0.5;with indentations left by \Nthe bottoms of the glasses.
0.5;He used that breeze to blow \Naway whatever was stuck
0.5;to the window to make it \Nlook like someone ran away.
0.5;Wind alone wouldn't be \Nenough to blow away
0.5;are you saying the object disappeared \Nwithout being seen by anyone?
0.5;It was attached in a way that would \Ncome undone when I opened it.
0.5;to the bedroom window and ran \Nthe fishing line to the door.
0.5;He taped it in place on the \Nbalcony side of the window.
0.5;When the door was opened and \Nthe fishing line came undone,
0.5;It's a stupid trick for making \Npeople believe they saw
0.5;But wouldn't someone have \Nfound the fallen fabric?
0.5;the roof can be attached \Nto the keys upon request.
0.5;If the keys were attached \Nto the weight hanging
0.5;from the balcony with \Nthe button taped down,
0.5;then the car's roof would have \Nclosed when the fabric fell,
0.5;leaving only a car parked \Nin a strange location.
0.5;Additionally, this trick only works if \NI entered the room at exactly 9 AM,
0.5;That's why he set his phone to \Ngo off one minute before nine.
0.5;to control the moment the bellhop \Nunlocked the door using the master key.
0.5;If the victim's request for \Nhelp was sent an hour earlier,
0.5;In a country where earthquakes \Nare so frequent,
0.5;that salt trick can't \Nbe left alone for hours.
0.5;Both the weight and fabric \Nhe used in his trick,
0.5;The bloodstained clothes are \Nstill in the trunk of my car.
0.5;Along with the knife I used \Nto inflict retribution
0.5;on the man who made a show \Nout of my sister's body.
0.5;Several years ago, my sister \Ncommitted suicide in the mountains.
0.5;In her note she said she \Nwas going to hang herself
0.5;During a TV show, Hotta Gaito \Nsaid he sensed the death
0.5;of someone other than the missing \Nperson on that mountain.
0.5;All so he could make people believe \Nin his supernatural abilities!
0.5;and tell her I got the man \Nwho disgraced her death.
0.5;No, they struck his vitals \Nand knocked him unconscious
0.5;during the seconds it \Ntook for me to run here.
0.5;Anyway, I'm surprised he can \Nproduce all kinds of voices
0.5;I could imagine using it \Nin all sorts of situations.
0.5;Did you figure out what \Ninformation Hotta acquired?
0.5;Kokuri mentioned something \Nbefore he was escorted away.
0.5;Someone saw the missing bodyguard \NAsaka holding that hand mirror.
0.5;He planned to summon the spirit \Nof Haneda Koji and scream,
0.5;I was just thinking how lucky we are that \NConan-kun knows where we're staying.
0.5;He's nothing like the boy \Nwe met ten years ago.
0.5;If she's Rum, the number two \Nperson of the Black Organization,
0.5;then does that mean Haibara's \Ndescription of a feminine man
0.5;actually refers to a woman who's \Nstrong on the inside like a man?
0.5;If she was working as a \Nbodyguard seventeen years ago,
0.5;But if they returned to middle school \Nage by taking the same drug I was given,
0.5;the man investigating the \NHaneda Koji murder case, died.
0.5;I don't care about Rum's \Nseventeen year old mistakes.
0.5;I heard he was involved in \Nthis morning's case, too.
0.5;then we'd better finish him \Noff while he's still asleep.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Foul-Mouthed Myna Bird!"""
0.5;I thought we could go to \Nthe high-class restaurant
0.5;on the top floor of the \NBeika Department Store.
0.5;You've got another good \Nthing waiting for you.
0.5;then why did she return \Nto Japan from America?
0.5;To confirm his death since she heard he \Nwas dead? Is that why she approached me?
0.5;Which means that middle school girl \NSera's hiding in her hotel room
0.5;Last night I found a cockroach \Njust before going to bed.
0.5;It took until four in \Nmorning to get rid of it.
0.5;The professor went to \Nsleep before me, though.
0.5;I was just wondering what kind of \Nlunch a high-class restaurant serves.
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;It sure is crowded since \NChristmas is coming up.
0.5;Well, the six of us did share \Nthree adult-sized meals.
0.5;I actually won a gift certificate \Nto this department store,
0.5;use this ten thousand yen gift \Ncertificate to buy presents for you.
0.5;Maybe I'll go check out the \Nnew Fusae brand clutches.
0.5;They said they're here at \Nthe department store today,
0.5;We can't let them start a commotion \Nhere in the restaurant.
0.5;Tell them we'll talk in the stairway \Nnext to the restaurant in thirty minutes.
0.5;I've been receiving tons \Nof messages telling us
0.5;to come right away because \Nthey found what they wanted.
0.5;Genta's on the seventh floor where \Nthe sporting goods store is.
0.5;Mitsuhiko's on the fifth floor \Nwhere the camera store is.
0.5;Ayumi-chan's on the fourth \Nfloor where the toy store is.
0.5;And Haibara's on the first floor where \Nthe bags and brand-name products are.
0.5;Everyone's expecting me \Nto buy them something.
0.5;Nothing. I was just thinking \Nit's been thirty minutes.
0.5;Isn't he the chef of the \Nrestaurant we were just at?
0.5;Someone was just stabbed at the \Ntenth floor restaurant area.
0.5;The culprit is currently \Nfleeing down the stairs.
0.5;Haibara, explain the situation to \Nthe department store reception desk
0.5;and tell them to stop any customers \Nwho are short of breath from leaving.
0.5;Remember their face, clothes, and \Ndistinguishing characteristics.
0.5;There's no telling what they'll \Ndo if they think you know.
0.5;So, at Conan-kun's direction, \Nthese three are the ones
0.5;who were caught at the \Nexit in a hurry to leave.
0.5;I was stopped while trying to \Ngo to a nearby convenience store,
0.5;so I've been running around all \Nthe shops I stopped at today.
0.5;When I took a closer look, \NI found it inside my bag.
0.5;I'm a chef, so I was here \Nto study the flavors.
0.5;The sautéed vegetables I had \Nwere particularly spicy.
0.5;All three of them do have \Na reason for being a hurry.
0.5;but they say the remember the culprit's \Ndistinguishing characteristics.
0.5;They had the number 2 on their \Nclothes, which were gray.
0.5;It was the same color as \Nwhat Haibara's wearing.
0.5;They were on the larger side, and \Nthey were wearing dark gray clothes.
0.5;They probably just looked \Nbig because you're so small!
0.5;They were wearing gray clothes \Nso light they were almost white.
0.5;They were average height, just a \Nlittle taller than the professor.
0.5;It was definitely a small \Nperson wearing gray clothes.
0.5;No, it was a large man \Nwearing dark gray clothes.
0.5;It was a woman a little taller than the \Nprofessor wearing light gray clothes.
0.5;around these stairs on the \Ntenth floor restaurant area...
0.5;According to Genta-kun, who \Nwas on the seventh floor,
0.5;was a smaller person with the \Nnumber 2 on their clothes,
0.5;which were a gray color \Nsimilar to Ai-chan's clothes.
0.5;According to Mitsuhiko-kun, \Nwho was on the fifth floor,
0.5;And according to Ayumi-chan, \Nwho was on the fourth floor,
0.5;But all three of the people \Nwho were stopped
0.5;from leaving the department \Nstore are wearing gray.
0.5;Kamaya-san, you're wearing a gray \Nsimilar to Ai-chan's clothes,
0.5;I seriously was just looking \Nfor an empty bathroom stall.
0.5;You seem to have injured the \Nfingers on your right hand.
0.5;And that fat kid said they had \Nthe number 2 on their clothes,
0.5;Then the person wearing light \Ngray like Ayumi-chan described...
0.5;I was in a hurry because I remembered the \NTV drama I missed was airing a rerun tonight.
0.5;The brooch on your chest \Ndoes resemble a number.
0.5;who's wearing dark gray clothes \Nlike Mitsuhiko-kun described.
0.5;because of the spicy food \NI ate, and was in a hurry
0.5;to leave so I could go \Nhome and take a shower.
0.5;I actually came here \Nbecause I heard rumors
0.5;that the Thai restaurant here \Nserves a soup that tastes like ours.
0.5;I tried it but didn't think \Nit tasted that similar,
0.5;By the way, there seems to be something \Nwritten on the back of your jacket.
0.5;Then there's the reason why Ayumi-kun \Nthought the culprit was a woman.
0.5;We just learned the victim Hosogoe-san \Nhas connections to those three.
0.5;Kamaya-san worked at a \Nrestaurant where the victim
0.5;But his attitude during work \Nwas bad, so he was fired.
0.5;Shikama-san lives in the \Napartment next to the victim's.
0.5;when he claimed the victim \Nripped off his food.
0.5;could you ask the three of \Nthem if they have gloves?
0.5;The culprit's fingerprints \Nweren't on the weapon, right?
0.5;There doesn't seem to \Nbe blood on any of them.
0.5;we'll be questioning the three \Nof you in a separate room.
0.5;Why won't they let us \Nwatch the investigation?
0.5;It's not surprising considering \Nyour random descriptions.
0.5;was small, had a number \N2 on their clothes,
0.5;Then how come you couldn't \Nsee the culprit's face?
0.5;where some basketball players \Ntaking the stairs got in the way.
0.5;Their new uniforms were \Njust completed today,
0.5;They're the same gray as the \Nclothes Ai-kun is wearing.
0.5;Yeah, the culprit was wearing \Nthe same gray color.
0.5;They quickly passed in front \Nof the basketball players
0.5;Could the basketball players \Nhave seen the culprit, too?
0.5;on the basketball team wearing \Nnumber 2 for the culprit.
0.5;Basketball refs use their fingers to \Nidentify players who violate the rules.
0.5;But they also use their fingers to indicate \None point for free throws, two for regular shots,
0.5;Because it's confusing, the \NInternational Basketball Federation
0.5;But none of those three \Nwere wearing the number 2.
0.5;Genta, your hands are full \Nwith a bat and glove.
0.5;Looks like Mitsuhiko and \NHaibara took selfies.
0.5;Ayumi-chan, you didn't take \Nyours yourself, did you?
0.5;A nice lady working at the \Ntoy store took it for me.
0.5;When I told her I got a message \Nfrom you saying the culprit
0.5;who stabbed someone was \Ncoming down the stairs,
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NDetectives in a Grove, Part Two!"""
0.5;Invited to the Nichiuri TV Building Completion \NCommemorative Movie Announcement Event,
0.5;the brutally murdered body of the \Nmovie's producer was discovered.
0.5;Hattori Heiji and I joined the investigation \Nand identified the culprits,
0.5;but they fled using a car parked \Nin the basement parking lot.
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;I guess you could call it the silver \Nlining, thanks to Inspector Ayanokoji.
0.5;We had her examined at the hospital, \Nand there was nothing wrong with her.
0.5;You didn't need to stay \Nwith me the whole time.
0.5;I think I'll head back to the \Ninvestigation headquarters.
0.5;Have you determined why \NYonekura-san's car exploded?
0.5;We believe it was an explosive made \Nfrom an acetone peroxide mixture.
0.5;what a Kyoto police inspector was \Ndoing at the same crime scene?
0.5;Two days ago, there was an accident \Non a road near Takaragaike in Kyoto.
0.5;In reality, he was a profligate son who \Nburned through his parents' wealth.
0.5;He and his car were found at the bottom of \Na cliff off a mountain road near his home.
0.5;The local authorities determined that he \Nfailed to make a turn and that it was an accident.
0.5;Using his fingerprints that escaped \Ninjury and his dental records,
0.5;and wouldn't the road have \Nbeen familiar to the victim?
0.5;I see. So the accident was \Nthe result of drunk driving.
0.5;He may have been drunk, but there \Nwere hardly any skid marks.
0.5;It's hard to believe this \Nwas just an accident.
0.5;That's right. He had a red \Nand a blue sports car.
0.5;Apparently he drove the red one on even \Ndates and the blue one on odd ones.
0.5;Naturally, the blue car really \Ndid have mechanical issues.
0.5;But we didn't find any signs \Nof tampering with the brakes.
0.5;If someone tampered with his car, why \Ndid they only tamper with the red car?
0.5;If they wanted to kill him as soon as \Npossible, wouldn't they have done it to both?
0.5;We get that you have doubts \Nabout the Takaragaike case.
0.5;But what's that got to do with you \Ncoming all the way out to Osaka?
0.5;I learned he associated with \NYonekura-san in the past.
0.5;but I arrived after Nichiuri \NTV had been locked down.
0.5;but I didn't want to make unnecessary \Nwaves, so I restrained myself.
0.5;Onda-san and Yonekura-san were \Nonce part of the same group
0.5;sponsored independent \Nfilm screening society.
0.5;I didn't find Yonekura-san's \Nname in Onda-san's phone either.
0.5;And while investigating that, you \Ndiscovered their past connection.
0.5;Onda-san's case aside, we can't \Nignore the bomb that was in the car.
0.5;Maybe someone other than those two \Nwas trying to kill Yonekura-san.
0.5;Mihara probably accidentally dropped \Nthe knife while cutting the rope.
0.5;If he noticed the person \Non top of the scaffold,
0.5;"He kept saying ""damn that \NOnda"" in a real tense voice."
0.5;Was it really a coincidence that you \Ntried to steal Yonekura-san's car?
0.5;Of course! Besides, Kouchi said he knew \Nwhere the spare key to his car was hidden.
0.5;Everyone was covering the car \Nthat went up in flames in Kyoto.
0.5;Maybe he was just shocked to see an article \Nabout the death of an old acquaintance.
0.5;Inspector Otaki, where were \NYonekura-san's belongings?
0.5;His plane ticket to Bangkok, \Nhis passport, and...
0.5;He had six newspapers, \Nincluding sports papers.
0.5;It's possible he wanted to know more about \NOnda's case and bought everything he could find.
0.5;Sounds like we'll have to \Nre-investigate our case.
0.5;I'll ask my forensics team \Nto reexamine Onda-san's car.
0.5;Please imagine a kaiju's head \Nat the end of that pole.
0.5;You're right. After all, no one's \Nactually been chased by a kaiju before.
0.5;How you want to act while \Nfleeing is up to you.
0.5;But please don't smile or behave \Nstrangely in an attempt to stand out.
0.5;You were good, but your \Nmovements were a little stiff.
0.5;You were great, too, especially \Nhow you carried the child.
0.5;I can't believe there was only one \Nvictim in an explosion this large.
0.5;The company that owned this warehouse \Nwent bankrupt a year ago.
0.5;They haven't found a buyer since \Nthen, so it's been abandoned.
0.5;Suemura Ryohei-san of the Daiho \Nfilm production department.
0.5;"Suemura-san was looking for a warehouse to \Nuse in the filming of ""Gomera VS Yaiba."""
0.5;but according to forensics, they \Nmost likely used acetone peroxide.
0.5;In other words, just like the \Nbomb that blew up Kouchi.
0.5;The results of our re-investigation \Nhave increased the probability
0.5;that Onda-san's death \Nwas a murder by bombing.
0.5;In other words, a bomb was rigged in \Nhis car, just like Yonekura-san's.
0.5;He'll probably be stationed at the \Njoint investigation headquarters.
0.5;I guess it's fine since \Nthat's so interesting.
0.5;Lately I feel like I've been demoted \Nfrom your partner to your errand girl.
0.5;Okuda-san, we heard you once sponsored \Nan independent film screening society.
0.5;It went well for a while, but things have \Nbeen terrible for the last few years.
0.5;Yonekura was the idea man and \Ncame up with all kinds of plans.
0.5;Onda was the aspiring scriptwriter, \Nand Suemura was the aspiring director.
0.5;According to Okuda-san, there was another man \Nwho worked with Yonekura-san and the others.
0.5;Ishizawa Katsuji-san, \Nan engineering graduate.
0.5;Engineering. In other words, he has the \Nscientific knowledge to build a bomb.
0.5;Apparently he was dexterous and came up with \Nall kinds of ideas for props to use in movies.
0.5;But isn't it a bit much to treat him as a \Nsuspect just for being an engineering graduate?
0.5;According to Okuda-san, Ishizawa-san \Nwas bullied by the other three.
0.5;They threatened him into building \Nprops and performing odd jobs.
0.5;Ultimately, he gave up on finding \Na job in the movie industry.
0.5;He's got an uncle in Sakai, \Nand he ended up at his house.
0.5;According to the neighbors, \Nhe doesn't have a steady job.
0.5;We found Ishizawa's fingerprints on \Nthe bomb at Suemura's murder scene.
0.5;If too many of us go, he might \Nfind out and cause a commotion.
0.5;We watched him all night, and \Nwe didn't see any movement.

0.5;Finding stolen goods is a cinch \Nfor the Silver Detectives.

0.5;We appreciate you telling \Nus something happened.
0.5;How did you find a body \Ninside a stranger's house?
0.5;I saw a hooligan tossing a \Ncigarette butt in the street.
0.5;When I chided him, \Nhe pushed me and ran off.
0.5;The victim is Kuroda Kiyomasa,\Ntwenty two, the family's only son.
0.5;He was killed roughly one hour \Nbefore you discovered his body.
0.5;They destroyed the crime \Nscene we needed to preserve.
0.5;Did you find the hooligan \Nyou were looking for?
0.5;He must've escaped while we \Nwere distracted by the murder.
0.5;I wonder why he ran when all you \Ndid was scold him for littering.
0.5;He had gaudy sunglasses, \Na Hawaiian shirt, and bleached hair.
0.5;As though he'd been cut\Nwith something sharp.
0.5;The victim Kuroda Kiyomasa-san \Nhad a terrible reputation.
0.5;H-He probably bought this car \Nwith the money he took, too.
0.5;Tossing things into the river is the \Nquickest way to get rid of them.
0.5;These are the sunglasses \Nthat hooligan was wearing.
0.5;The Silver Detectives found \Nsome bloodstained sunglasses.
0.5;In other words, the murderer was \Nthe hooligan we were chasing.
0.5;He snuck into that house, \Nkilled the victim, and fled.
0.5;he hurried back, destroyed \Nthe evidence, and ran away.
0.5;Noticing the victim's \Nblood on his sunglasses,
0.5;Why did they form a\Ndetective group, anyway?
0.5;Well, someone told Tokunaga-san \Nabout a stolen red bicycle.
0.5;Tokunaga-san deduced where a \Nthief would abandon a bicycle,
0.5;No, I only told the police \Nmy bicycle was stolen.
0.5;Tokunaga-san put out an ad \Nin the city's PR magazine.
0.5;Someone in the apartment \Nnext door had just died.
0.5;An old lady named Kano Tae fell down the \Nstairs at the station and hit her head.
0.5;She'd just withdrawn three \Nmillion yen from the bank,
0.5;Tokunaga-san formed a detective \Ngroup to find the culprit.
0.5;Maybe Tokunaga-san formed a detective \Ngroup to find the person who ran her over.
0.5;It's the recently deceased \NKuroda Kiyomasa-san.
0.5;But he seemed sincerely apologetic,\Nso she didn't report him to the police.
0.5;Several days later, she died after \Nwithdrawing three million yen from the bank.
0.5;Only Tokunaga-san had any useful \Ninformation about the hooligan, right?
0.5;It's a mystery novel written \Nby John Dickson Carr,

0.5;He deliberately hit Kano \NTae-san with his car.
0.5;Kano-san died because she \Nwent to withdraw money.
0.5;You wanted to get revenge on \NKuroda-san with your own hands.
0.5;"That's why you ""discovered"" \Nthe body first."
0.5;But the police always suspect \Nwhoever discovers a crime,
0.5;You visited Kuroda-san while \Nhis family was away on vacation.
0.5;threw the bloodstained sunglasses in the \Nriver, and gathered your detectives.
0.5;to look for an imaginary hooligan \Nand discovered the body.
0.5;"you ""accidentally"" erased the\Nmurderer's fingerprints"
0.5;You had to discover the sunglasses to cast \Nsuspicion on your imaginary hooligan.
0.5;But such a sudden and incredible \Ndiscovery would be too good to be true,
0.5;But you knew which car \Nbelonged to Kuroda-san.
0.5;The police would eventually \Nnotice the connection
0.5;between the victim and a man \Nwho discovered the body.
0.5;Once they investigated you, \Nthey would find conclusive evidence.
0.5;We just want you to admit you were \Nwrong and atone for your crime.
0.5;I thought if only her leg \Nhadn't been broken...
0.5;She should've given me her \Nmoney before she died.
0.5;If they can run like that, \Nthey shouldn't need senior bus passes.

0.5;They're doing us a big \Nfavor by letting us watch.
0.5;You should've brought Ran-neechan \Nwith you to watch karate.
0.5;I-I think they've known \Neach other for a long time.
0.5;I once stopped making progress \Nwith my karate training.
0.5;Anyway, that sparring you \Ndid earlier was so cool!
0.5;I'm always surprised by \Nthe growth of children.
0.5;His body was stiff, and he \Nhad trouble with stretches.
0.5;He had trouble displaying his \Nabilities in demonstrations.
0.5;Now he's passed the shodan \Ntest and wears a black belt.
0.5;He was a weak runner and became \Nexhausted before the run was over,
0.5;Would it be all right if \NI skipped practice today?
0.5;It's a display of the medals and \Ntrophies I've won in various matches.
0.5;It's the belt the master of this \Ndojo has worn for generations.
0.5;It's a symbol of the blood \Nand sweat of our seniors.
0.5;a lot of people quit over \Nhis intense practices.
0.5;On top of that, he doesn't charge \Nthe children for practice.
0.5;I'm here because you said you wanted \Nto sell this place as soon as possible.
0.5;I'm prepared to buy it \Nfor a reasonable amount.
0.5;They could make a lot of \Nmoney selling the land.
0.5;Sensei, are you serious \Nabout selling this place?
0.5;It's time for me to give up \Nmy black belt and retire.
0.5;there's still no one worthy \Nto take over the Tenshin dojo.
0.5;That's why I thought to \Nclose it down instead.
0.5;I'm planning to ask another \Ndojo to take them in.
0.5;Didn't they come here because \Nthey looked up to you?
0.5;Not even a child could \Nfit through that window.
0.5;Surprised by the sound of \NMakoto-san breaking the lock,
0.5;There was no time for \NMakoto-san to hide the belt.
0.5;You've been planning to \Nsteal Takami-sensei's belt
0.5;We cross the third bridge and run \Nback along the opposite side,
0.5;but you didn't check each \Nof their faces, did you?
0.5;They swapped places when you \Nfirst did a head count at the park.
0.5;Hiroki-kun and Obashi Norio-kun, \Nwho had gone home earlier.
0.5;Norio-kun pretended to be \NHiroki-kun and ran with you.
0.5;He snuck around the back \Nto avoid being spotted,
0.5;took the belt from the display \Ncase through the window,
0.5;It's impossible for a child to \Nclimb that wall without a rope.
0.5;by putting his body through the \Nwindow and stretching his arms.
0.5;and waited for the others \Nto return from their run.
0.5;They didn't just switch people \Nat the park after the run.
0.5;You said now that you \Nhad the belt you wanted,
0.5;Makoto-san, you understood \Nhow the children felt.
0.5;who did it when you noticed \Nthe belt was missing.
0.5;Hiroki-kun had to make \Nhis stiff body flexible.
0.5;Only the small Hiroki-kun could \Nclimb the deteriorated drainpipe,
0.5;Katsuto-kun worked hard to pass his shodan \Ntest so he could wear a black belt.
0.5;And Norio-kun worked to \Nget better at running.
0.5;I'm here to collect your \Nsignature, just like we agreed.
0.5;but could we forget \Nabout what we discussed?
0.5;Either return all the \Nmoney you owe immediately,
0.5;I'm glad a lawyer agreed \Nto help Takami-sensei.

0.5;Yes. We've calculated the wind, temperature, \Nhumidity, and atmospheric pressure.

0.5;It's no wonder they call you the 100% \Naccurate beautiful weather forecaster.

0.5;Not even this popular weather forecaster \Ncan predict if it's an accident or a case.

0.5;Oh, right. I'll send you the \Nproposal for your next show soon.
0.5;We're restricting access to the \Nstage so no one goes near it.
0.5;Mori-sensei, I hope you'll \Nappear on my show again.
0.5;Yasumi-san, we start shooting \Nright after the break.
0.5;It's meant to invoke images \Nof a weather forecast.
0.5;Victim Sekine Yasumi-san's \Nmanager Yamaguchi Takuya-san.
0.5;According to the staff, this \Nstructure was deteriorating,
0.5;After meeting with me, \NYasumi-san took a break.
0.5;But before her break, she decided \Nto come check this stage.
0.5;but a section had deteriorated, \Nand she fell to the first floor.
0.5;She scratched it on the floor with her bloody\Nhand while writhing in her final moments!
0.5;Come to think of it, didn't you hear \Na popping sound before the scream?
0.5;Besides, we were all over \Nthere when Sekine-san fell.
0.5;First, you tie this tinsel \Nto one of the stage's supports.
0.5;Then you tie this end to the \Nopposite side of the stage.
0.5;Didn't you hear this sound \Nbefore Yasumi-san's scream?
0.5;She came to check the stage and \Nfell for this malicious trap.
0.5;Yamaguchi-san, you said you'd be \Nhere until the early morning, right?
0.5;By the time I woke up, they \Nhad just started recording.
0.5;Then we still don't know \Nwho set the trap or when.
0.5;Then shall we investigate the fingers \Nand footprints left around the trap?
0.5;We'll collect fingerprints \Nand saliva samples from you.
0.5;I overheard your conversation \Nin the kitchen yesterday.
0.5;I'll embarrass Yasumi-san \Ntomorrow with a balloon.
0.5;I couldn't say anything because I thought \Nit would embarrass our company.
0.5;If there's anything wrong with the set \Nagain, I don't want to see you again!
0.5;I wanted to make a fool out of that \Narrogant woman in front of everyone!
0.5;Her hair that was disheveled \Non only one side.
0.5;Yes. Conan told me Yasumi-san said \Nshe wouldn't check the stage.
0.5;However, in reality she \Ndid and fell for the trap.
0.5;But if you think of it this \Nway, it all makes sense.
0.5;Yes. This person told her beforehand \Nabout the balloon trap.
0.5;They advised her to pop it before filming \Nto make a fool out of Hiroko-san.
0.5;Yes. Yasumi-san meant to \Ntorment you even more.
0.5;Additionally, the culprit \Ntold her she would be safe
0.5;Yasumi-san did as she was told \Nand triggered the balloon trap.
0.5;But in the next moment, she triggered \Na second trap set by the true culprit.
0.5;The other mystery left behind \Nis the whooshing sound
0.5;When the culprit heard the balloon \Npop, they turned on the machine.
0.5;Detective Takagi, will \Nyou turn the machine on?
0.5;The culprit covered Yasumi-san \Nwith the carbon gas mist
0.5;Unable to open her eyes, she \Nwas forced to back away.
0.5;However, the dilapidated \Nrailing was right behind her.
0.5;But only the left side of \NYasumi-san's hair was disheveled.
0.5;Additionally, her hair accessory \Nflew to the far wall.
0.5;A blast of gas from her left \Nmust have disheveled her hair,
0.5;The culprit set their own\Ntrap behind Hiroko-san's trap,
0.5;Not only that, but you told Yasumi-san\Nabout it to lead her into your trap.
0.5;Paired with your brown shoes, \Nyou look truly fashionable.
0.5;The mouth of the smoke machine was \Npointed towards the dilapidated railing.
0.5;After the incident, the culprit had to turn \Nthe funnel back to its original position.
0.5;You left your brown shoe \Npolish on the machine.
0.5;She realized I'd been embezzling \Nthe program's funds.
0.5;She made me set up new programs for her \Nand hand over the production funds.
0.5;Before she fell, Yasumi-san \Nrealized you had deceived her.
0.5;She used her remaining strength \Nto leave a dying message
0.5;using a special symbol \Nso you wouldn't notice.
0.5;"Kodama Yukio-san, you're the only man \Nwith snow, or ""yuki,"" in his name."
0.5;The skies are clear. Yasumi-san's \Nforecast was right.

0.5;However, Kisaki-sensei escaped from her \Ncaptors, hid in the abandoned building,
0.5;and used the phone she stole from \Nthe kidnappers to ask Ran for help.
0.5;Sounds like she was \Nkidnapped from her office.
0.5;They're probably not the \Nsame Eri-san you just added.
0.5;If the person using Eri's \Nusual icon is an impostor...
0.5;And the one without an \Nicon is the real Mom...
0.5;Shinichi-niichan told me \Nlawyers use Western commas
0.5;instead of Japanese commas in their \Ndocuments when writing horizontally.
0.5;That habit shows up in \Ntheir normal writing, too.
0.5;The messages I received from Mom \Nbefore all have Western commas.
0.5;Using what few hints we could gather \Nfrom our exchanges with Kisaki-sensei,
0.5;she's hiding in a closed space where \Nshe can't see out any windows.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;There's going to be another \Nloud noise shortly.
0.5;If you hear the sound, could you tap \Nyour phone with your fingernail again?
0.5;You'll know what sound I'm talking \Nabout as soon as you hear it!
0.5;Based on the speed of sound, \Nshe's about 340 meters from here.
0.5;She's somewhere one kilometer from the \Nchurch next to the detective agency
0.5;In other words, Kisaki-sensei's \Nin either Buroku or Sutan-cho.
0.5;Both districts have abandoned \Nbuildings a kidnapper could use.
0.5;She was hiding here until recently, \Nbut moved somewhere else.
0.5;If she got out of here, then she must have \Nseen what's outside the window, right?
0.5;If she and her daughter are messaging \Neach other separately through the app,
0.5;we'll know everything she and \Nher daughter say to each other.

0.5;In other words, something that's normally \Nred that's still partially black.
0.5;"""Since it's light out tonight"" refers \Nto the full moon out tonight."
0.5;And there's only one building that shuts off \Nhalf its lights when there's a full moon out.
0.5;Now that you mention it, the top \Nhalf of its lights are off tonight.
0.5;I've heard the Toto Tower shuts \Noff half its lights on full moons
0.5;"Then what does ""the two swordfish \Nlook delicious"" mean?"
0.5;"The ""delicious"" refers to \Nsomething that looks pretty,"
0.5;and the English word for \Nthe animal is swordfish.
0.5;Since there are two of them, she's telling \Nyou to think of something with two blades.
0.5;Wasn't there a really strong \Nsamurai who used two swords?

0.5;Yeah. If she's able to see the Bell Tree Tower \Nclearly because the Toto Tower is darkened,
0.5;then Kisaki-sensei must be someplace \Nshe can see the Bell Tree Tower
0.5;After that lawyer sent some nonsensical \Nmessage about crabs and swordfish to her daughter,
0.5;even though I'm sending her \Nfalse information as the lawyer.
0.5;She was using Western commas \Ninstead of Japanese commas
0.5;to help her daughter differentiate \Nbetween our messages and hers.

0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;I'm sorry for asking the \Nsame question over and over.
0.5;Employee Shimomura Gyosuke-san,\Ntwenty-five years old.

0.5;The culprit knew Kanzaki-san \Nnormally wears the costume.
0.5;But not realizing someone else \Nhappened to be filling in today,
0.5;he attacked Shimomura-san thinking \Nit was Kanzaki-san and fled.
0.5;And Shimomura-san got caught \Nup in the crossfire.
0.5;I wonder why the culprit attacked him \Nwhile he was wearing the costume, though.
0.5;He won't get blood on himself \Nthrough the costume.
0.5;He attacked the wrong man \Nbecause of that plan.
0.5;But he'll realize soon enough \Nthat he attacked the wrong man.
0.5;I didn't see anyone dressed like the witness \Ndescribed on the security camera footage.
0.5;He probably took off his ski mask and \Ngot out of those conspicuous clothes.
0.5;Either the culprit took them with him, or \Nif it was the work of a store employee,
0.5;then they could still be hidden \Nin the store somewhere.
0.5;Your employees knew Kanzaki-san \Nnormally wears the costume.
0.5;Both to see if we're hiding the \Nclothes and to clear our names.
0.5;Examine everything including \Nour personal belongings.
0.5;This attack on the wrong \Nman doesn't make any sense.
0.5;He may have deliberately dressed \Nconspicuously to make us think that.

0.5;And this room is the only \Npossible hiding place.
0.5;You called everyone together \Nbecause you found out who did it.

0.5;But if he simply killed him, the killer's \Nmotive would have led us to him.
0.5;To prevent that, he tried to make \Nus believe he accidentally killed
0.5;If he was an accidental victim, we \Nwouldn't investigate Shimomura-san.
0.5;this was a planned murder disguised as\Na mistake to avoid a police investigation.
0.5;With Shimomura-san hovering \Nbetween life and death,
0.5;You needed someone to corroborate the \Nthreats made on Kanzaki-san's life.
0.5;You used a famous detective like \Nmyself to verify the story.
0.5;ordered Shimomura-san to wear the \Ncostume instead, and tried to kill him.
0.5;you needed someone to hear \Nyou say, “Die, Kanzaki.”
0.5;That's why you instructed \Nme to clean that area.
0.5;New employee Teruko-san \Nwas the perfect choice.
0.5;A veteran employee might \Nrecognize it as your voice.
0.5;After stabbing Shimomura-san, \Nyou fled into this break room.
0.5;Kanzaki-san was here, but \Nyou were fast asleep,
0.5;probably because of the sleeping pills \Nyou were given with the stomach medicine.
0.5;Just when you changed out of your ski \Nmask and clothes and into your uniform...
0.5;I came to check on Kanzaki-kun \Nsince I'm worried about him.
0.5;If I didn't hurry, you would get \Nrid of the damning evidence.
0.5;you didn't have time to \Ntake them out of the store.
0.5;But if he hid them somewhere, \Nhe wouldn't have said that.
0.5;Because searching the store \Nwould have been fruitless.
0.5;After committing the crime, he simply \Nflipped his jacket and pants inside out.
0.5;I just appointed you the manager of \Nthe new Beikado branch that's opening.
0.5;Surprisingly enough, \Nhe threatened to report me.
0.5;Because the costume was so \Nthick, the wound wasn't fatal.
0.5;Get this disgraceful-looking \Nidiot out of here!
0.5;The suspect and escorting\Nofficer have both gone missing.
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “Detective \NTakagi On the Run in Handcuffs!”
0.5;I didn't ask you to do \Nthat. Drink if you want to.
0.5;Then this is none of my business. \NYou don't need me here.
0.5;I think I'll be able to make the \Npanel during the second half.
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!
0.5;What will happen when \Nthe couple goes onstage?
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;If you get drunk, you won't \Nbe able to give your talk.
0.5;Well, it doesn't seem \Nlike he'll need me today.
0.5;Make sure you study all this \Ngreat detective's secrets.
0.5;but we actually have to \Nleave before it starts.
0.5;But as long as it doesn't go into overtime, \Nwe'll be able to return during the panel.
0.5;Thank you so much for \Ncoming today, Mori-sensei.
0.5;I'm delighted to have the world-famous \Ndetective speak at the grand opening of our theater.
0.5;If there's anything you \Nneed, don't hesitate to ask.
0.5;I'm a huge fan of yours, \Nso I'm a nervous wreck.
0.5;He's famous for playing police \Nofficers and detectives.
0.5;That's right. They call him \Nthe king of mystery shows.
0.5;For some reason he's always solving \Nmysteries under precipitous circumstances.
0.5;I hope you'll appear in one of \Nmy shows sometime, Mori-san.
0.5;I've looked after this place \Nsince your father was here.
0.5;Taking pride in an outdated \Nmanagement philosophy
0.5;that kept us in the red died off with \Nmy father—rather, my predecessor.
0.5;Reizei-san, our contract \Nwith you has already ended.
0.5;"""Keep doing that, and you won't have a \Nsingle person open their heart to you."""
0.5;It's even better when \Nthere's a camera around.
0.5;Sounds like there's bad \Nblood between those two.
0.5;Please relax in your \Nchanging rooms until then.
0.5;I mean, did I impress you with \Nmy detective skills again?
0.5;Why don't you use your voice changer \Nto give the lecture yourself?
0.5;The window to Inokoshi-san's \Nchanging room is...
0.5;The body's keeping the door \Nshut instead of the lock.
0.5;The victim is actor Inokoshi \NKenichiro-san, forty-eight years old.
0.5;He was scheduled to appear on the \Npanel after Mori-san's lecture,
0.5;This was in the left breast \Npocket of the victim's jacket.
0.5;The blade of the weapon \Nmatched the damaged section.
0.5;It's safe to assume it was damaged when \Nthe victim was stabbed in the heart.
0.5;Under the circumstances, the door \Nonly opened about five centimeters,
0.5;making it impossible for \Nanyone to enter or exit.
0.5;The window we broke was locked \Nfrom the inside as well.
0.5;There were no signs that \Nit had been tampered with.
0.5;So how did the culprit leave the \Nroom after killing Inokoshi-san?
0.5;At the very least, one \Nthing is clear, Inspector.
0.5;Takagi, how's the security \Nhere at HISHIDA Hall?
0.5;that aside from the front entrance \Nand reception desk of the hall,
0.5;all entrances including emergency \Nexits are locked from the inside.
0.5;This wasn't the work of \Nan outsider, Inspector.
0.5;and 300 audience members inside \NHISHIDA Hall right now.
0.5;so they must have dragged the \Nchair with the body sitting in it.
0.5;We were thinking about making that \Nannouncement to the audience.
0.5;But only the owner Hishida can make \Nthe decision to cancel the event.
0.5;But fortunately, the great detective \NMori Kogoro-sensei is here.
0.5;As the president of the company running the \Nevent, I'd hate to leave things like this.
0.5;The great detective Mori Kogoro will \Nsolve this case within an hour.
0.5;Delaying the lecture an \Nhour may be the right call.
0.5;If the event is canceled \Nand the audience leaves,
0.5;it could be disastrous if \Nthe culprit is among them.
0.5;If you're so sure about this, \NMori-kun, you must know who did it.
0.5;Of course. I've even solved the \Nmystery of the locked room.
0.5;The locked room didn't use \Na very complicated trick,
0.5;I was able to confirm everyone's \Nalibi for 2:50, with one exception.
0.5;Reizei-san, the former \Nmanager of HISHIDA Hall,
0.5;Your motive was the rage you \Nfelt towards Inokoshi-san
0.5;after he brought you in line \Nlike you were on a TV show.
0.5;And you created this locked \Nroom using your cane.
0.5;This room is constructed exactly \Nthe same as Inokoshi-san's room.
0.5;and removed your cane just \Nbefore the door closed.
0.5;I'm sure it would open \Nmore if you pushed harder,
0.5;It's enough to create a \Nquick and dirty locked room.
0.5;Earlier I took Reizei-san \Nto his changing room.
0.5;Wouldn't it have been difficult \Nfor him to do all that?
0.5;dragging it across the room, \Nleaning it against the door,
0.5;and supporting it all with one cane \Nwould've been rather difficult.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Mori \NKogoro's Grand Lecture, Part Two!"""
0.5;I wouldn't expect less from the \Ngreat detective Mori Kogoro.
0.5;He got involved in two \Ncases before he knew it.
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut the world is even more so!
0.5;Great detective work is on today's menu!\NEat up and solve the case!
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;During a sudden blackout\Nat Ran's cooking class,
0.5;the teacher, Uemori Michi,\Nwas stabbed in the back and killed!
0.5;String and ice had been used to\Nturn off the electrical room breaker.
0.5;And, after investigation,\Nthe possibility of an outside killer vanished!
0.5;"""The Cooking Classroom\NMurder Case (Part 2)."""
0.5;All four of you could have set up\Nthe ice trick in the electrical room.
0.5;and the ice could've\Nbeen brought from home.
0.5;Yuko-san. Are there any\Nice picks in this classroom?
0.5;Yes. In the bottom drawer,\Nnext to the microwave oven.
0.5;Inspector. These iron\Nskewers have sharp tips.
0.5;Yuko-san. Do you keep\Ncount of how many there are?
0.5;That can't be! There were\Nten when I counted last night!
0.5;Inspector! We have\Nour murder weapon!
0.5;The killer stole a skewer\Nfrom that drawer in advance
0.5;But could you really stab with this?\NThere's nowhere to grip it.
0.5;If it were me, I'd choose\Nsomething with a handle.
0.5;Plus, the mark on her back seemed\Nsmaller than those skewers' tips.
0.5;Inspector. We should\Ncheck their belongings.
0.5;Okay, everyone. Please place\Nall your belongings on the table.
0.5;Everyone has aprons, pens,\Nhandkerchiefs, and recipes...
0.5;Oh? Only Kazue-san\Nhas a notebook and a brush.
0.5;Yuko-san. After Kazue-san arrived,\Ndid you leave the classroom?
0.5;You stole the skewer while\NYuko-san was in the bathroom!
0.5;because your eyes were used to\Nthe dark thanks to those dark glasses!
0.5;Quit joking around!\NI'm sensitive to light due to my age!
0.5;you left your bag at your\Nfeet instead of in the dining room.
0.5;Besides, how could I stab\Nsomeone if it didn't have a handle?!
0.5;And the skewer in question\Nis hidden in this notebook!
0.5;The skewer is supposed\Nto be under the rings!
0.5;She asked if there was\Nanything to use as a splint last night.
0.5;It would seem the murder\Nweapon wasn't a skewer.
0.5;Uemori-san's wound was 5 cm\Ndeep and under 1 mm in diameter.
0.5;Under one millimeter?!\NThen that means...
0.5;The murder weapon wasn't a skewer\Nor an ice pick. It was needle-like.
0.5;A nurse would be\Nfamiliar with using syringes.
0.5;There must be some syringe needles less than\N1 mm in diameter and over 5 cm in length!
0.5;It was meant to keep one\Neye accustomed to the dark!
0.5;When the lights went out,\Nyou removed that eye patch
0.5;In-law strife was\Nprobably your motive!
0.5;That should be no problem,\Nif you really have a sty.
0.5;Kaoru-san!\NHow'd you get that black eye?!
0.5;Then you wore the\Neye patch to hide that bruise?
0.5;but my mother-in-law dotes\Nover her son Tatsuhiko, my husband.
0.5;"She was always,\N""Tatsuhiko this, Tatsuhiko that..."""
0.5;He even hit me last night\Nbecause I talked bad about her.
0.5;He left for Hawaii on a\Nbusiness trip this morning.
0.5;I wonder how he'll react when\Nhe finds out his mother's been killed.
0.5;Y-You still aren't cleared of suspicion!\NYou can see out of that eye!
0.5;But the weapon\Nwasn't a syringe needle.
0.5;There was almost no blood\Non Uemori-sensei's back.
0.5;Blood would've followed\Nthe syringe needle up to the skin
0.5;Just so you know, I'm not the\Nonly one with a motive for killing her.
0.5;The other three\Nhave plenty of reason, too.
0.5;You've been friends\Nwith her for over thirty years,
0.5;After all, she stole your lover\Ntwenty-seven years ago and married him!
0.5;You've stayed single\Never since, and only came here
0.5;so you could see your old lover,\Nher husband and my father-in-law.
0.5;I guess you must've really loved\Nhim to keep coming to this class.
0.5;Nishitani-kun, I hear she was going\Nto cut off your financial support.
0.5;Because she found someone\Nwith more talent than you.
0.5;So you had to give up your dream\Nof having your own restaurant.
0.5;Yuko-san, you surely held a grudge\Nbecause she stole your recipes.
0.5;"She coldly responded with,\N""If you don't like it, then surpass me."""
0.5;In other words, all four of you\Nhad reasons for killing Uemori-san.
0.5;Nishitani-san, you massaged\NUemori-sensei's shoulders.
0.5;Meaning you must know\Nabout therapeutic points on the back.
0.5;I believe acupuncture needles\Nare less than 1 mm in diameter.
0.5;and I've never touched an\Nacupuncture needle in my life.
0.5;Mori-kun, I've had\Nacupuncture on occasion.
0.5;They're so thin and weak that\Nstabbing 5 cm in would be impossible.
0.5;Here's the blouse\Nyou asked me to mend.
0.5;A sewing set. You're the\Nonly one with one, correct?
0.5;5 cm in length.\NUnder 1 mm in width.
0.5;Get real! How would you pull\Nit out if you stuck it all the way in?!
0.5;Besides, people are\Nsurprisingly tough-skinned,
0.5;and there's no way to grip a\Nsewing needle for stabbing anyway.
0.5;It's true that a sewing needle\Nfits the murder weapon perfectly.
0.5;And, being able to find\NUemori-sensei in the dark...
0.5;It would be easy with that,\Nand not immediately obvious!
0.5;So that's why that\Nperson made that mistake...
0.5;so it should be around\Nhere somewhere.
0.5;Here it is!\NWhich means it contains...
0.5;It's possible that a sewing\Nneedle was the murder weapon,
0.5;Do as you like.\NThere's no point, though.
0.5;It's also possible to\Nhide a needle in your clothes,
0.5;I know who did it.\NNow for the murder weapon.
0.5;No blood was detected\Non anything in the sewing set.
0.5;Did the body search\Nturn up anything, Takagi-kun?
0.5;Nishitani-san\Ndoesn't have a needle on him.
0.5;As I mentioned before, neither\Nof us could've found her in the dark.
0.5;Inspector, you must\Nnot let those two go yet.
0.5;There was a way to find\NUemori-san, even in the darkness.
0.5;By wearing special\Ncontact lenses in advance.
0.5;Yes. He wore black,\Nsunglass-like contact lenses.
0.5;When he first entered the classroom,\Nhe didn't have them in.
0.5;Nor when he snuck through\Nthe back entrance before then.
0.5;This is because they\Nwould've been inconvenient
0.5;when setting up the ice\Ntrick in the electrical room.
0.5;He put the contacts in about\Nten minutes before class began,
0.5;Yes. That's why when\Nhe ran into you in the hallway...
0.5;Ran-san! Sorry!\NMy mistake! You look alike!
0.5;so he couldn't differentiate\Nbetween you and Yuko-san.
0.5;But do such convenient\Ncontact lenses actually exist?
0.5;In Japan, contact lenses\Nare pharmaceutical products,
0.5;so there's a specific standard \Nfor visible light transmission,
0.5;The color contacts that were\Nrecently put on the market
0.5;for use in things like\NTV dramas and commercials.
0.5;So they're not\Nabsolutely impossible to obtain.
0.5;In any event, Nishitani-san let his\Neyes grow accustomed to the dark,
0.5;and the instant the lights went\Nout, he quickly removed the contacts,
0.5;opened the sliding door,\Napproached Uemori-san,
0.5;I believe the weapon was\Nindeed a sewing needle.
0.5;But you said yourself it wouldn't\Nbe easy to stab 5 cm with one,
0.5;and it might get stuck\Nif you're not careful!
0.5;A thimble and some\Nthread solve those problems.
0.5;A thimble? You mean the ring\Nthat's used when doing needlework?
0.5;That's right. Have a look at\NNishitani-san's right index finger.
0.5;Yes. He put a thread\Nthrough the needle, and...
0.5;But I believe he burned the thread\Nusing his stove to be rid of it.
0.5;Nishitani-san threw it out the\Nbathroom window after putting 'em in!
0.5;And I found this\None inside his cooking bowl!
0.5;Nishitani-san. Think you\Ncan you explain this for us?
0.5;You should find the weapon\Nbefore accusing someone of murder!
0.5;Nishitani-san! Are you\Nstill going to make excuses?
0.5;I thought it was\Na great hiding place, too...
0.5;I lose, Mori-san.\NYou truly are a great detective.
0.5;I got the contacts when I went\Nto Europe last month for training.
0.5;I paid someone at a\Nmanufacturer to make them.
0.5;There's that, but I felt bad that\NYuko-san's recipes were being stolen.
0.5;So I wanted to enact my plan the\Nnight before her best-seller party.
0.5;Yuko-san. You might not have\Nrealized it, but I've always...
0.5;and create perfect recipes\Nthat she couldn't help with...
0.5;Nishitani-san. Your actions\Nweren't based on love.
0.5;They were nothing but criminal\Nactions resulting from selfishness!
0.5;After what happened to\NUemori-sensei,
0.5;Sonoko decided to go to\Na different cooking classroom.
0.5;So, can I enroll, Dad? It costs\Nthe same as Uemori-sensei's place!
0.5;These sardines are great!\NJapanese people love Japanese food!
0.5;I guess you should forget\Nabout the cooking classroom...
0.5;I guess I won't be eating any\Nof Ran's French cooking for awhile.
0.5;I saw it running super-fast\Nthrough the hallway four nights ago!
0.5;It's proof that someone was pressed\Nagainst the window, looking out!
0.5;Next episode takes place \Nat a school at night.
0.5;We came to the filming \Nlocation of a zombie movie,
0.5;during a commotion caused by \Nan audition for zombie extras,
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;But the Heiji and Conan duo \Nsolve the surprising mystery.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""A Cottage Surrounded \NBy Zombies, Part Three!"""
0.5;Now that I, demon hunter \NYamamura, am here,
0.5;the two of you went upstairs \Nto get Harawaki-san for lunch.
0.5;But he was collapsed in the \Nroom next door to this one,
0.5;Later, you were surprised by the \Nzombies Harawaki-san invited.
0.5;and while you were fighting \Nzombies downstairs,
0.5;for some reason Ejiri Kyoko-san \Nwas killed by having her neck cut.
0.5;Furthermore, there's a video \Nof her neck being cut,
0.5;and the culprit is Harawaki-san who \Nis supposed to have committed suicide.
0.5;Since Harawaki-san suddenly \Ndisappeared from the room
0.5;In some ways, this is \Nexactly what I expected.
0.5;If that's the case, where \Ndid Harawaki-san go?
0.5;He must've blended into the \Nzombie horde and escaped.
0.5;Otherwise he'd never have \Nbeen able to take this video!
0.5;Even if he tried to trick \Nthe victim into filming it,
0.5;Besides, isn't Kyoko-san a \Ncameraman and not an actor?
0.5;in the zombie movie they shot \Nduring college eight years ago.
0.5;But they probably would've \Nchecked any footage they shot.
0.5;No one's seen the footage \Nyou took eight years ago?
0.5;The president said he'd show us the \Nfootage he edited together later.
0.5;My brother was probably \Nexcited to see your reactions,
0.5;What roles did Harawaki-san \Nand Kyoko-san play?
0.5;Harawaki-kun becomes a zombie \Nand tries to attack Kyoko.
0.5;he said a zombie movie \Ndoesn't need romance?
0.5;Harawaki-kun said he wanted to fight \Nback instead of just becoming a zombie.
0.5;is the footage from that \Nmovie really missing?
0.5;B-But Harawaki-kun told me \Nhe had it on his tablet.
0.5;Oh, but I have the pictures we \Ntook while filming the movie.
0.5;with the letter E on it \Nthat Kyoko wore back then.
0.5;She had a bunch of them in different \Ncolors since her name was Ejiri.
0.5;Speaking of clothes, Kyoko-san took \Noff her top before being killed.
0.5;Now that you mention it, during \Nour bathroom break while filming,
0.5;That was about an hour before we \Nwent looking for Harawaki-san.
0.5;I went to the bathroom \Nduring that break, too,
0.5;Ran-chan went earlier and \Ntold me to be careful
0.5;since there was only one spare \Nroll of toilet paper left,
0.5;But when I just went to the \Nbathroom, the spare roll was back.
0.5;There doesn't seem to be \Na secret door in the room.
0.5;And all you can do with \Na roll of toilet paper
0.5;The prayer beads that fell \Ninto the upper drawer
0.5;Did you two ride a motorcycle \Nhere all the way from Osaka?
0.5;we took the bullet train to \NTokyo and rented a bike there.
0.5;We heard the cottage was \Ndeep in the mountains, so...
0.5;He said there was something \Nimportant he wanted to discuss.
0.5;You know who did it, so you're \Ngoing to solve the mystery?
0.5;Conan-kun, did you figure \Nout who did it, too?
0.5;Well, I guess the Sleeping \NKogoro's not up to it.
0.5;After all, those poisonous mushrooms \Nhave already put him to sleep.
0.5;A-And one of Harawaki-kun \Ncommitting suicide by poison.
0.5;The culprit played the video \Non Harawaki-san's mini tablet
0.5;so the lens would face the \Nfloor or the seat of the chair
0.5;But did we shoot a scene of \NHarawaki-kun drinking poison?
0.5;Harawaki-san said he didn't \Nwant to just become a zombie.
0.5;So he probably secretly filmed \Nthe scene with the president.
0.5;And didn't the first script have the \Nprotagonist cutting down her friends
0.5;who became zombies one after \Nanother with a magical sword?
0.5;Then they must've shot a scene of \NHarawaki-san biting Kyoko-san
0.5;The backgrounds are the same \Nsince they were shot here.
0.5;She was wearing the hair she tied \Nback like she did in college, too.
0.5;Kyoko-san is wearing the \Nsame T-shirt in the video
0.5;as the one from the picture \Nyou showed us earlier.
0.5;It's hard to see because \Nher hand is in the way,
0.5;Kyoko-san's body was wearing \Na plain white T-shirt.
0.5;It's proof that they were \Nkilled by the same person.
0.5;You're the one who said only \Nhe could've written it.
0.5;that the culprit had used this \Nto see inside the envelope.
0.5;You just set it on top of the \Nenvelope and look through the hole.
0.5;You can't see through the white envelope \Nbecause of the reflected light.
0.5;So when the toilet paper went \Nmissing during the break...
0.5;The culprit used the break to poison \NHarawaki-san, look inside the envelope,
0.5;There's a space carved out \Nthat would fit a human body.
0.5;S-So that's why the prayer \Nbeads in the top drawer
0.5;They fell through the hole \Ninto the bottom drawer.
0.5;They say it's hardest to notice the \Nthings that are closest to you.
0.5;You didn't notice that the first \Ntime you opened the drawer?
0.5;And the middle board was distributing \Nhis weight evenly, so I didn't notice.
0.5;shouldn't the body have come \Nout when you opened the drawer?
0.5;There's no board at the \Nback of either drawer.
0.5;You can keep what's inside in place \Nby setting the middle board in place.
0.5;this board would keep the \Nbody from coming out.
0.5;But we didn't have time to put \Nthat kind of trick together.
0.5;S-So when the president \Nvanished from the room...
0.5;He was hiding inside the \Nwardrobe using this setup.
0.5;I'm certain that Joji-san \Nhid inside the wardrobe.
0.5;So my brother died because he couldn't \Nget out of the wardrobe on his own?
0.5;by pushing out the drawers \Nand removing the board.
0.5;And if Harawaki-kun and \NKyoko-san were killed, then...
0.5;Does that mean it was \Nthe president's brother?
0.5;After being trapped inside the \Nwardrobe and starving to death,
0.5;when you came to look \Nfor him four days later?
0.5;There was someone who knew Joji-san \Nwas hiding inside the wardrobe.
0.5;You're the one who killed \NHarawaki-san and Kyoko-san, too.
0.5;during the bathroom break and got \Nhim to drink the poisoned water.
0.5;including the subtitle you read \Nusing the toilet paper on his phone,
0.5;played the eight year old video \Non Harawaki-san's tablet,
0.5;You placed the phone in the \Nhand of Harawaki-san's body
0.5;with the image blacked out, \Nand returned to filming.
0.5;but Kyoko-san realized \Nthe trick you had used.
0.5;it might actually solve the mystery \Nbehind Harawaki-kun's suicide.
0.5;So when you fled to the second \Nfloor during the zombie scare,
0.5;you spilled water or something \Non Kyoko-san's top
0.5;Then you recorded the eight year \Nold video on Kyoko-san's phone,

0.5;No, no. You can't give it to \Nhim now, but you can later.
0.5;That's great. Now he won't get \Nan upset stomach during the game.
0.5;Doesn't the stadium keep \Nan official sports drink?

0.5;The estimated time of death is \Nbetween 2 AM and 6 AM this morning.
0.5;We won't know the cause of \Ndeath until after the autopsy,
0.5;We didn't find any fingerprints \Non the stun gun
0.5;But Mori-san found him last night, \Nand he returned home safely.
0.5;Masako-san, does this mean \Nyour husband left the house
0.5;He said he needed to do something \Nfor work and left around 1 AM.
0.5;We're checking the security \Ncamera footage right now.
0.5;But the culprit tried to \Nconceal his identity, right?
0.5;Mori-san, thank for everything \Nyou've done so far.
0.5;Now that things have ended up like \Nthis, I don't know what to say.
0.5;Hey, Mister. Was it really \Nher husband that died?
0.5;If she made a mistake, wouldn't \Nshe be really happy to hear that?
0.5;Let's start by questioning \Nthe shop employees.
0.5;Someone who's been missing \Nsince this morning?
0.5;He's not the type of guy to take \Nthe day off without notice.
0.5;The employee who's been \Nmissing since this morning.
0.5;The place is a mess, but it doesn't \Nlook like there was a scuffle.
0.5;There's a cup and toothpaste, \Nbut I don't see a toothbrush.
0.5;Judging by the room's state, it looks \Nlike he was in a hurry to go somewhere.
0.5;It certainly does look \Nlike he was in a hurry.
0.5;No, it looks like an insurance \Ncertificate or something.
0.5;There's no security camera \Nfootage of the last three days.
0.5;The DNA on the provided toothbrush \Nand body were a match.
0.5;They all point to Muto \NIssei-san being the victim.
0.5;However, not only were there \Nsigns that the culprit
0.5;tried to conceal the victim's identity and \Nthe security camera footage was erased,
0.5;This is the odd feeling I \Ngot when we first came here.
0.5;When standing inside the fence, only \Ntwo of the three poles are visible.
0.5;But now everything's \Nfinally coming into focus.
0.5;First, are you aware of the missing \Nemployee Nonaka Sadahiko-san?
0.5;We actually believe he might \Nbe involved in Muto's murder.
0.5;Then was Masako-san asked to \Nprovide a DNA sample of Muto-san?
0.5;Takagi, I'd like you to \Nhelp me with something.
0.5;We've finished examining \Nthe area for the most part.
0.5;We've already finished \Ninvestigating your home,
0.5;You gave us instructions because you \Nknew Muto's wife would come here.
0.5;His wife provided the \Ntoothbrush he normally used.
0.5;You're aware an employee \Nhere, Nonaka Sadahiko-san,
0.5;Nonaka-san's toothbrush was \Nmissing from his apartment.
0.5;And he was most likely killed by \NMasako-san's husband Muto Issei.
0.5;He was probably a thief who repeatedly \Nused this second-hand shop as a cover.
0.5;Because I hired Mori-san, I believe \Nhe feared his crimes would be exposed.
0.5;he said we'd flee overseas and \Nwait for things to cool down.
0.5;He summoned Nonaka-san here and \Nknocked him out with a stun gun.
0.5;It's just my deduction based on \Nthe evidence and circumstances.
0.5;The toothbrush I provided was brought here by \NNonaka-san when Muto summoned him here.
0.5;Probably because if Muto \Nwas thought to be dead,
0.5;I saw it while I was helping \Nhim organize documents.
0.5;He took out a life insurance policy \Non me for an exorbitant amount.
0.5;So the burnt documents were \Nan insurance certificate.
0.5;If he's still alive, please tell \Nus where he is immediately!

0.5;I used to write novels under\Nthe pen name of Tomokazu Imai.

0.5;I thought that Satoru Imatake\Nused that name for his debut...

0.5;Could you take a couple\Nmore shots for me?
0.5;I'm Detective Yokomizo from\Nthe Saitama Police Department.
0.5;I'd like to ask you\Nabout Satoru Imatake.
0.5;In the hotel room you\Nwere both staying in.
0.5;The murder took place just\N2 or 3 minutes after 8 PM.
0.5;He fled the room\Nimmediately afterward.
0.5;You're completely sure\Nabout all of this?
0.5;Yes. The TV coverage of\Nthe festival had just started...
0.5;Wait, aren't you the famous\Ndetective Kogoro Mori-san?!
0.5;I read about those difficult cases\Nthat you solve all the time!

0.5;Only the money has been removed\Nfrom the victim's wallet.
0.5;Plus the perpetrator\Nransacked the room.
0.5;This was an ordinary crime\Ndone for monetary gain.
0.5;Judging from the fact that\Nthe victim fell near the front door,
0.5;most likely someone had\Nknocked on the door
0.5;the real killer was\Nthe room's other occupant!
0.5;I was at the Tenkaichi Night\NFestival when it happened.
0.5;That's where I met Mori-san\Nand the others.
0.5;But I believe it was during the last\Nhalf of the festival that we met.
0.5;Come on! I was there\Nfrom the very start!
0.5;Just what sort of alibi does\Nhe have in that camera?!
0.5;But what do these have\Nto do with his alibi?
0.5;"That's right. We met Sasai-san\Nwhen the ""Ichi"" character was lit."
0.5;I think you could make it\Nto the festival grounds in 40 minutes
0.5;"After the first character,\N""Ten,"" is lit at 8:00,"
0.5;This proves that he was at the festival\Ngrounds before 8:25, at the latest.
0.5;it's impossible to go from here\Nto the festival grounds in 25 minutes!
0.5;How can this be?\NHow can that picture be there?!
0.5;Is photographic alteration\Nout of the question?
0.5;Hey, now. I handed the camera\Ndirectly over to you
0.5;You were the one who\Ndeveloped the film, right?
0.5;There were no signs of the camera\Nor film being tampered with!
0.5;You already knew\Nhe was at the festival.
0.5;They remembered because he was\Nconstantly asking the time.
0.5;"That was because I wanted to make\Nit in time for the ""Ten"" character."
0.5;As you can see,\NI forgot my watch today.
0.5;Something bugs me about\Neverything you did!
0.5;It's almost as if you were\Ntrying to make an alibi...
0.5;I would appreciate it if you would\Nstop wasting time like this
0.5;If you're looking for\NImatake-san's body,
0.5;I rushed here as soon as the police\Ncalled me, but I guess he really is...
0.5;"Yes, it published his\N""Heroic Sword Legend"" series."
0.5;Imatake did mention that his\Ndeadline was coming up soon
0.5;That's right!\NHis deadline was tomorrow!
0.5;Even if I ask someone else to write\Nsomething, there isn't enough time,
0.5;and nothing would ever\Nbe as good as his!
0.5;so I just happened\Nto bring it with me today.
0.5;I doubt it compares with\NImatake's series, though.
0.5;No, seeing as you used\Nto work with him,
0.5;I'm sure the editors\Nwill all be delighted!
0.5;That's only the prologue\Nto an especially long story.

0.5;Very well! I shall write for\Nthe late Imatake's sake!
0.5;It would seem I must hurry\Nback home and get to work.
0.5;For Imatake, who was killed by\Nsome idiot who just wanted his money.
0.5;How? How was he able\Nto take that picture?!
0.5;What's more, the camera was untampered\Nwith and he had Ran use it.
0.5;Something that will bring\Nhis alibi crumbling down!

0.5;You really disappoint me,\NDetective Yokomizo!
0.5;yet you were still fooled by the trick\Nused to make that alibi photograph!

0.5;...the one standing next to you--\NNorikazu Sasai!
0.5;Weren't you the one who said\Nthis was a robbery?!

0.5;The murderer fled immediately\Nafter the gunshot.
0.5;Do you think it would be possible\Nto ransack this entire room
0.5;Most likely it was done\Npurposely before the murder
0.5;to make it look like\Nan ordinary robbery.
0.5;All of the evidence at the scene\Nof the crime seems to point to me.
0.5;This is most likely\Na picture that you took

0.5;where you ran into Ran and had\Nher continue taking more pictures.

0.5;Tokuzono-chan had a messed \Nup sense of humor.
0.5;I had the officer help \Nme carry a bunch of them.
0.5;Yeah, I sent Hoegi-kun a message \Nearlier asking for one.
0.5;Huh? There aren't enough \Nstraws for the shakes.
0.5;This is a regular straw, \Nbut the AD can have it.
0.5;Huh? Oh, it's about the late \NTokuzono-chan's replacement.
0.5;We currently believe the poison \Nto be a type of cyanide compound.
0.5;Do you ever use that type \Nof chemical while filming?
0.5;If anything, I think we might \Nuse it in the prop studio.
0.5;Which means your staff could have \Ngotten their hands on a poison?
0.5;Either way, we can assume they \Nacquired the poison beforehand.
0.5;It was wrapped in a handkerchief and \Ncarefully tucked away inside his pants pocket.
0.5;That thing you stuck in here \Nwill come flying out, right?
0.5;You can't scare me when \NI know what to expect.
0.5;That's the flapping noise I heard \Njust before Tokuzono-san fell.
0.5;The sound that toy just made is the \Nsame as the sound I heard then.
0.5;But according to the staff, these practical \Njoke devices were a favorite of...
0.5;Tokuzono-san had tons of \Npractical joke devices.
0.5;Then it's possible Tokuzono-san himself \Nwas trying to set this device and slipped.
0.5;Even if it's not real, he couldn't \Nstand things that look like bugs.
0.5;If it made a noise, that means the rubber \Nband powering the toy was wound up.
0.5;Once the rubber band is wound, something \Nneeds to hold it down until it's ready to fly.
0.5;It would need to be stuck between \Nthe pages of a notebook,
0.5;No poison was found in the shake, \Ncup, or straw Odori-san was using.
0.5;Maybe they swapped out the entire \Ncup during the confusion.
0.5;Then maybe they swapped out \Njust the poisoned straw.
0.5;If you hastily pull out a straw, its \Ncontents should drip back into the cup,
0.5;They didn't have time to \Nremove it carefully either.
0.5;but Odori-san himself could have taken \Na poison he acquired beforehand.
0.5;They loved swapping twisted \Njokes with each other.
0.5;The AD probably tried to prank Tokuzono-san \Nthe way he always pranked others.
0.5;But he took the unexpected accident \Nto heart and poisoned himself.
0.5;If it was a prank, he wouldn't need \Nto acquire the poison beforehand.
0.5;And Odori-san didn't have \Na motive for murder.
0.5;If it's something he picked \Nup, it was probably then.
0.5;Was he killed because he figured \Nout the culprit's identity?
0.5;But it could have been \Nset by any of the staff
0.5;who were filming on the fourth \Nfloor until just before then.
0.5;Come to think of it, Odori-san laughed after \Nseeing the footage of Tokuzono-san's fall.
0.5;But there wasn't anything particularly \Ninteresting in that footage.
0.5;We can probably narrow down the people \Nwho could've poisoned Odori-san.
0.5;It was the AD Hoegi-san \Nwho bought that shake.
0.5;so it would be possible to poison \Nit while purchasing the drink.
0.5;She sent a message ordering a different \Nshake and tasted Odori-san's shake.
0.5;she could've mixed it into the shake \Nby gently blowing through the straw.
0.5;She's also the reason the \Ndrinks were purchased.
0.5;And it was Tomioka-san who \Nhanded Odori-san his shake.
0.5;In other words, these four \Ncould've poisoned the shake.
0.5;For some reason, no poison was \Nfound in Odori-san's drink.
0.5;there should be poison in the \Nshake itself or the container.
0.5;And if we can't figure that out, \Nwe can't make any progress.
0.5;Yeah, that's what an ordinary \Nperson would think.
0.5;I need to keep an eye on them so Sera \Ndoesn't ask any weird questions.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is, ""Kyogoku \NMakoto the Understudy, Part Three!"""
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 967 ""Kaiju \NGomera VS Kamen Yaiba (Climax)"""
0.5;A producer was murdered at \Nthe new Nichiuri TV building.
0.5;Hattori Heiji and I identified the murderers, \Nbut the case took a surprising turn.
0.5;A connection emerged between the murder \Nvictim and a man who died in Kyoto.
0.5;Meanwhile, another explosion \Noccurred in Osaka Nanko,
0.5;The Osaka police's efforts uncovered \Nan important suspect, but...
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;but the problem is the blow \Nto the back of his head.
0.5;He'll live, but he'll need \Ntotal bed rest for a while.
0.5;You won't be able to \Nquestion him for a while.
0.5;In any case, for now he needs total rest, \Nand he's not receiving any visitors.
0.5;Shouldn't we check out Iwazawa-san's house \None more time before returning to the hotel?
0.5;You're saying Ishizawa's condition didn't \Nmake the great Mori Kogoro feel anything?
0.5;If Ishizawa is the serial bomber, \Nwho was keeping him locked up?
0.5;But we're just taking a \Nquick look and then leaving.
0.5;Anyway, forensics searched his whole \Nhouse and didn't find anything.
0.5;Isn't it a detective's \Njob to figure that out?
0.5;Apparently he was held \Nhere for a couple of days.
0.5;They left him without \Nanything to eat or drink.
0.5;That's when he got all those cuts \Nand bruises all over his body.
0.5;I wonder what Ishizawa-san \Nwas doing in the kitchen.
0.5;He was looking for a knife or something \Nto cut the ropes binding him.
0.5;But look. The front door is right \Nat the bottom of the stairs.
0.5;He would've been saved immediately \Nif he left through the front door,
0.5;After all, he'd been locked in \Na room without food or drink.
0.5;Now that we've checked \Nthe place out, let's go.
0.5;Where's the high school \Ndetective of the west?
0.5;I haven't had time for Ishizawa \Nwho you tacked on later,
0.5;but that's almost certainly how \Nthe other three are connected.
0.5;all carried large amounts \Nof debt at one point.
0.5;committed by four suspects for an amount \Nthat would've paid off all their debts.
0.5;The culprits broke into the mansion \Nby blowing up the back door.
0.5;After tying up the couple that owned \Nthe house and two of their employees,
0.5;But if the four current victims \Nwere the culprits in this robbery,
0.5;I doubt the victims from ten years \Nago are getting their revenge now.
0.5;Ten years ago, I never thought \NI'd end up like this.
0.5;Onda recently had a failed investment \Nand was on the verge of bankruptcy.
0.5;The problem is that everyone connected \Nto the case has already been killed.
0.5;Onda-san had two cars, so why was only \None of them rigged with explosives?
0.5;Why didn't the bomb in Yonekura-san's \Ncar have a detonator or timer?
0.5;How did the culprit know Suemura-san \Nwould go to that warehouse?
0.5;Why was Ishizawa-san locked inside his \Nroom and abandoned for several days?
0.5;Of the three bomb plots, \Nonly the third succeeded.
0.5;The first exploded on a different \Nday than originally planned,
0.5;and someone else killed the \Ntarget of the second, right?
0.5;wouldn't you normally postpone the \Nthird and come up with a new one?
0.5;or there must be some reason they \Ncouldn't postpone their plan.
0.5;Gomera has risen out of the Osaka \NBay and is headed straight this way!
0.5;It's an audition, but \Nit's not that big a deal.
0.5;We were supposed to select some \Nactors to appear in the movie
0.5;but two people dropped out after what\Nhappened with Yonekura-san's case.
0.5;I'd do anything to appear in \Na movie with Gomera and Yaiba!
0.5;I thought we could confirm \Nbefore the meeting,
0.5;He just keeps repeating that\Nhe doesn't know anything.
0.5;He's protecting the person \Nwho kept him locked up.
0.5;Come to think of it, I wonder \Nwhat Mori-san is doing.
0.5;He said he'd return to his hotel \Nafter stopping by Ishizawa's house.
0.5;I only meant to take a quick break at \Nthe hotel, but ended up oversleeping.
0.5;Since I went right after forensics searched \Nthe place, I wasn't expecting much,
0.5;but I discovered something confusing \Nabout Ishizawa-san's actions.
0.5;First, I'd like to know your opinion on the \Nsituation as an Osaka police investigator.
0.5;but we believe Ishizawa Katsuji \Ncommitted the bombings.
0.5;He plotted to murder Yonekura and the \Nothers to get revenge for the past.
0.5;Didn't he want us to think \Nthere was another culprit?
0.5;he had two cars which he drove \Non alternating days, correct?
0.5;Yes. On even days he drove the red one, \Nand on odd days he drove the blue one.
0.5;That's because the blue car happened \Nto be having mechanical problems.
0.5;That coincidence was the \Nfirst question I had.
0.5;If the culprit wanted to kill \NOnda-san as soon as possible,
0.5;he would have rigged both \Ncars with explosives.
0.5;In other words, the culprit wanted \NOnda-san to die in the red car
0.5;The bomb was placed in the abandoned \Nfactory beforehand, right?
0.5;The bomb was placed inside a box and \Nset to explode if it was opened.
0.5;How did the culprit know Suemura-san \Nwould be the one to open the box?
0.5;Then how did they know Suemura-san \Nwould go to an abandoned factory
0.5;And why did the culprit do something as \Ndangerous as leaving a bomb there beforehand?
0.5;They'd be far away by the \Ntime the bomb exploded.
0.5;They wanted an alibi for when \NOnda-san's car exploded.
0.5;there was one man who'd have an alibi for \Nthat day and the day Suemura-san died,
0.5;Neither a timer nor a \Ndetonator has been found.
0.5;It was an explosive, but it wasn't \Na bomb. Not yet, at least.
0.5;Yonekura-san probably intended \Nto go rig the explosive as a bomb
0.5;I see. So that's why he locked \NIshizawa inside his house.
0.5;He probably intended to blow \Nup Ishizawa and his house
0.5;So it'd be treated as an accidental \Nexplosion caused by the bomber himself.
0.5;Yonekura intended to \Nleave a bomb in his car,
0.5;and then blow it up in \Nthe airport parking lot.
0.5;And he'd escape misfortune because \Nhe happened to be on a business trip.
0.5;Yonekura-san kept muttering Onda's name \Nwhile staring at the screen of his phone.
0.5;He was so distressed that \NOnda had died a day early
0.5;that he couldn't get out of \Nthe way of the falling kaiju.
0.5;This is where the strange actions \Ntaken by Ishizawa-san come in.
0.5;Ishizawa-san kicked open the \Ndoor and escaped his prison,
0.5;But the front door was just across \Nfrom the stairs he fell down.
0.5;Why did Ishizawa-san go into the \Nkitchen where he was discovered
0.5;instead of leaving through the \Nfront door and seeking help?
0.5;The answer was in a \Nnewspaper in the entryway.
0.5;It had been delivered while \NIshizawa-san was locked up.
0.5;An article on Yonekura-san's murder \Nwas all over the front page.
0.5;If he sought help from the police, he'd be \Nquestioned about Yonekura-san's bombing,
0.5;Ten years ago, four men stole \N120 million yen in Kobe.
0.5;I-Impossible. They're\Nthe suspects in that case?
0.5;My investigation revealed \Nthat Yonekura-san, Onda-san,
0.5;and Suemura-san all paid off \Nlarge debts ten years ago.
0.5;Not only that, but recently \NOnda-san had a failed investment,
0.5;It was hard to find since \Nthe mansion was so huge.
0.5;As Mori-han asked and looking \Nfor evidence in Onda's house.
0.5;The one they called Takashi is Onda, \Nand the man next to him is Ishizawa.
0.5;Once we arrive, Takashi and \NKatsuji will go to the back door.
0.5;If we copy this video and distribute \Nit to everyone, no one can betray us.
0.5;We should contact the \NHyogo police immediately.
0.5;Which means in the presence \Nof the final man...
0.5;We've learned that what we thought was a team \Nof four robbers was actually a team of five.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Kaiju \NGomera VS Kamen Yaiba, Finale!"""
0.5;This year also marks the 20th anniversary \Nsince Conan first began airing.
0.5;First among these are two \Nweeks of one hour specials.
0.5;Our appropriately super \Nduper special guest is here.
0.5;With the same feelings we've \Nalways held still in our hearts,
0.5;In the brilliantly gorgeous world of \Nkabuki, a legendary mask summons a case.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Why don't you take your time telling \Nus about what happened at the station?
0.5;I'm terribly sorry this happened \Nbecause of my lack of supervision.
0.5;I tell him every day not to bother \Nother people, but this brat never—
0.5;No. This boy stopped my car \Nwhen it was out of control.
0.5;But Sonoko called to say \Nshe happened to see it.
0.5;The brakes were manipulated \Nso they wouldn't work.
0.5;We should secure the scene \Nimmediately and get forensics here.
0.5;But the car crashed after the \Nkid jumped into the street.
0.5;I thought he was finally \Nshowing his true colors.
0.5;I've met him a bunch of times \Nat kabuki after-parties.
0.5;You don't seem like you'd have \Nanything to do with kabuki, though.
0.5;I've dined with Ebizo-san \Na bunch of times, too.
0.5;I've never been to that \Nsushi restaurant, though.
0.5;I'll have to go talk to them later, \Nbut I can't not deliver this.
0.5;Last night, weren't you the \Nlast one to leave the garage?
0.5;Like suspicious characters \Nor something like that.
0.5;In the kabuki world, the person who manages \Nall the actors is known as the president.
0.5;"It's ""Nanatsu Men"" \Nof the Kabuki Juhachiban."
0.5;In recent years, it was \Nperformed in 1893 and 1983.
0.5;It's set in the mansion \Nof Major General Yoshida.
0.5;And he takes masks out of five boxes \Nand dances according to each one.
0.5;The old man, the clown, the Hannya demon, \Nthe old woman, and finally the Buaku demon.
0.5;While he's trying to steal \Nthe Yoshida family treasure,
0.5;Akaemon appears while\Nwearing the Buaku mask.
0.5;Saemon is shocked, and the boxes are \Nclosed and can't be opened again.
0.5;If the title means Seven Masks, \Nthen why are there only five boxes?
0.5;Yes. I heard the only script was lost \Nin a fire during the Edo Period.
0.5;They didn't have copy machines back \Nthen, and it wasn't copied by hand.
0.5;It's not like anyone saw \Nthe first performance.
0.5;"And so Ebizo-san decided to \Ncreate a modern ""Nanatsu Men""."
0.5;The expression changes based \Non your viewing angle.
0.5;This mask was made during \Nthe Kamakura Period.
0.5;but it's made from the\Nvery same wood used
0.5;to restore the Buddha at Todaiji \NTemple between 1185 and 1195.
0.5;In other words, it was made from the \Nwood leftover from making the Buddha.
0.5;Our president bought it \Nfrom a foreign collector.
0.5;We can't have Japanese cultural \Nassets going overseas.
0.5;"You're performing ""Nanatsu Men"" \Nof the Kabuki Juhachiban, right?"
0.5;"Ebizo-san, why did you decide \Nto perform ""Nanatsu Men""?"
0.5;Since you're such a big \Nfan, I brought him here.
0.5;While performing in London, I went \Nto Baker Street every chance I got.
0.5;I've always admired the detective \Nskills of the Sleeping Kogoro.
0.5;I-Indeed! I don't know what to do \Nwith all the admiration I receive.
0.5;I clearly remember when \Nyou defeated Kaito Kid.
0.5;Mori-san and everyone else, \Nwould you like to come with me?
0.5;And when you say this line, \Ntry to threaten me more.
0.5;Are kabuki stories becoming \Nmore and more modern?
0.5;The most important thing in kabuki is to draw\Nout the acting skill and appeal of an actor.
0.5;we all work on the script \Nand performance together.
0.5;Naturally, while maintaining the \Nspecialty of the Ichikawa school.
0.5;Since it was deliberately manipulated, \Nthey were trying to kill him.
0.5;We want to investigate \Nthe garage at his home.
0.5;In any case, we need to \Nget him to the hospital.
0.5;"I know he's an up-and-coming playwright, \Nbut he can't rewrite ""Nanatsu Men""."
0.5;I'd like to come back \Nagain. Right, Conan-kun?
0.5;Last night we had a meeting at \Nthe office, and then I went home.
0.5;Yes, though my secretary \NTakahashi was driving.
0.5;Tomorrow I'm going to stop by Ebizo-san's \Nplace before going to the office.
0.5;I'll take this car, so you \Ntake the station wagon.
0.5;When I get home, Takahashi always cleans \Nthe inside of the car before leaving.
0.5;How long did Takahashi-san \Nstay here after that?
0.5;I was in my study, so I don't \Nknow when Takahashi left.
0.5;The camera that covers this \Narea would be over there.
0.5;It's on a hard drive, so between all ten,\NI have seventy-two hours of footage.
0.5;If I could afford to live there, \NI'd have maids to clean for me.
0.5;Hosoo-san. Why are you calling \Nso early in the morning?
0.5;His secretary Takahashi-san \Ncommitted suicide.
0.5;It was wrapped around the \Nradiator's electric fan.
0.5;From here, he passed it through the driver \Nseat's headrest and wrapped it around his neck.
0.5;So when the engine was started, the \Nstring was wound in and strangled him.
0.5;It doesn't look like he \Nwas strangled right away.
0.5;The radiator's electric fan doesn't \Nstart right after the engine.
0.5;It takes time for the coolant to \Nheat up and trigger the sensor.
0.5;Yes, especially during this \Nseason when it gets cold.
0.5;But first, we need to determine \Nthe cause of death.
0.5;If we're not careful, something \Nweird might come out of his stomach.
0.5;Yesterday, President Yabusaki \Nput it in that case.
0.5;No, they'll take prints from \Neveryone who entered this room.
0.5;If we find anyone else's fingerprints, \Nit will help to advance the investigation.
0.5;they would have left behind \Na print of their texture.
0.5;Mori-san is saying Takahashi-kun \Ndidn't commit suicide.
0.5;Not only has there been a theft, \Nbut now there's a murder, too.
0.5;don't you think it's weird the two-faced\Nmask wasn't in the case left in the car?
0.5;If Takahashi stole it himself, \Nit would have to be in there.
0.5;Did they want to sell it \Nor keep it for themselves?
0.5;It has to be someone who knows \Nthe value of the two-faced mask.
0.5;And someone who knew the mask \Nwas in the president's locker.
0.5;The locker was opened really violently, \Nbut all the other locks are pristine.
0.5;and the front door was \Nlocked at the same time.
0.5;but if only Minowa-san and the receptionist \Nhave keys to the lock beyond that...
0.5;They entered without damaging \Na modern cylinder lock,
0.5;so why would they pry open such \Na simple locker with a bar?
0.5;Apparently they know where the \Nsecurity cameras are located, too.
0.5;Ah, right. You've been \Nsearching for that route.
0.5;There are cameras in here, and while the \Nsecurity is tight around the dressing rooms,
0.5;without being seen as long \Nas I didn't use the elevator.
0.5;After all, there's nothing \Nvaluable in the president's room.
0.5;Minowa-san said it's the \Ncode to the front door.
0.5;This morning it was on \Nthe floor of that room.
0.5;It's the script from our \Nprevious performance.
0.5;Cutting up scripts we don't need \Nand using them as notepaper.
0.5;The case started when somebody manipulated \Nthe brakes on Hosoo-san's car.
0.5;Next came the secretary Takahashi-san, again \Nmanipulating a car in a complicated way.
0.5;It's hard to imagine Iwami-san did it \Nsince he doesn't have a driver's license.
0.5;When did you find out Iwami \Ndoesn't have a license?
0.5;but are you sure you're not actually solving\Ncases while hiding behind Mori-san?
0.5;And this time, my secretary \NTakahashi was actually murdered.
0.5;Even when I chewed him out, the next day \Nhe'd act like nothing had ever happened.
0.5;I've just been tasked with \Nprotecting the president.
0.5;We'll be finished soon, so could \Nyou wait in the meeting area?
0.5;But there's no telling \Nwhere they'll come from.
0.5;If you know someone with aim that \Ngood, could you introduce me to them?
0.5;Ideally I'd like to talk to \Nhim without causing a fuss.
0.5;Dr. Terashima, please come \Nto the medical office.
0.5;Once again, Dr. Terashima, please \Ncome to the medical office.
0.5;He's such a difficult patient, \NI don't know what to do.
0.5;But from his perspective, I may \Nhave been putting pressure on him.
0.5;I'll conduct the rest of \Nthe investigation myself.
0.5;Suspecting your friends and \Ncoworkers must be difficult.
0.5;I'll tell everyone to answer honestly \Nif you come to ask any questions.
0.5;It was during his nighttime IV check, \Nso it must have been around three.
0.5;Mister, are you a detective \Ninstead of a cameraman?
0.5;When you look at someone\Nthrough a viewfinder,
0.5;you can clearly see what\Nthey are inside and out.
0.5;That's why being a cameraman \Nis such good money.
0.5;Before the cops hid him behind blue sheets, I \Ngot this from the rooftop of a nearby building.
0.5;If it was a suicide, he would \Nhave done it more simply.
0.5;If you get your enemies and friends \Nmixed up, it could cost you your life.
0.5;Shioji-kun has accounting work \Nto do, so she needs to stay here.
0.5;I just ran into him at the hospital where \Nthe playwright Iwami-san is staying.
0.5;There are a lot of unfortunate \Nrumors about him.
0.5;I guess you have something more fun to do \Nthan play soccer with us like you promised.
0.5;She said you went to the Ichikawa \Nsushi restaurant by yourself!
0.5;Oh, right. Do you have \NKaneko-san's cell phone number?
0.5;As a detective, there's a \Nlot I'd like to ask you.
0.5;Like how you got pictures of \NTakahashi-san's dead body.
0.5;Someone stole the two-faced \Nmask I borrowed from Hosoo-san.
0.5;The least suspicious person is \Nactually the most suspicious.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Conan and \NEbizo's Kabuki Juhachiban Mystery, Part Two!"""
0.5;High school student Shinichi was\Nforced to take a drug that shrunk him!
0.5;If the organization learned that\NShinichi and Conan are the same person
0.5;everyone close to\Nme would be in danger!
0.5;Only Professor Agasa\Nknows the truth!
0.5;With my identity hidden,\Nthere's always only one truth!
0.5;It'd cost an arm and\Na leg to eat sushi in Ginza!
0.5;Your heart might\Nact up again if you don't.
0.5;It looks like he's the\Npresident of a company...
0.5;Yeah, I've seen him\Nbefore in some magazines...
0.5;Oh, yeah! He's Mr. Okida,\Npresident of Bigwood!
0.5;And it's all thanks to the software\Nyou gave me a year ago!
0.5;Tokito! Why the hell\Nweren't you paying attention?!
0.5;I have to thank you in some way.\NWhat would you like, little boy?
0.5;Pardon my rudeness,\Nbut aren't you Mr. Okida of Bigwood?
0.5;just let me know if you\Never need my services!
0.5;I'm going to\Ndrink like a fish tonight!
0.5;Oh, Inspector Megure!\NGood morning!
0.5;So Inspector Megure\Nsaw your business card
0.5;Yeah, and then\Nhe called just to be safe.
0.5;Sometimes the police\Ninvestigate unnatural deaths too.
0.5;Mr. Okida was an\Nimportant person, after all.
0.5;Wait, you were\Nwith Mr. Okida last night...
0.5;How did you do that?\NThat was amazing!
0.5;The computer checked my\Nfingerprints and then opened the door.
0.5;nearly everything inside\Nit is controlled by computer.
0.5;The air conditioning is\Nprogrammed to always keep the place
0.5;at the most pleasant\Ntemperature 24 hours a day.
0.5;Inspector Megure.\NThis is his secretary, Miura-san.
0.5;He came to pick\Nup Mr. Okida at 8:00,
0.5;but he never came out, so he\Ngrew suspicious and came inside,
0.5;only to find him cold in his bed,\Nwith his pajamas still on.
0.5;but it was probably a sudden\Ndeath due to a heart attack.
0.5;According to his doctor,\Nhe's always had heart problems...
0.5;On top of that, I'm told he\Ndrank a lot of alcohol last night.
0.5;Yesterday was special, as he\Nhad gotten an important contract.
0.5;She left with their daughter\Non an overseas trip yesterday evening.
0.5;and when he came home,\Nhe was so drunk he couldn't walk.
0.5;So I took him to his\Nbedroom and put him to bed.
0.5;The estimated time of death\Nwas around 2:00 a.m.
0.5;I'm asking just to be sure,\Nbut where were you then?
0.5;I dropped an egg at the register,\Nso I'm sure the cashier can vouch for me.
0.5;That's Aslan.\NIt's the daughter's cat.
0.5;He seems hungry.\NI'll go feed him.
0.5;Inspector. I'd like to\Nsee the body for myself.
0.5;I'd pass even if\Nyou told me to look!
0.5;No exterior injuries,\Nand no sign of drugs?
0.5;For someone who died while\Nsweating, there's too much here!
0.5;The AC in this house\Nis computer-controlled
0.5;so that the temperature\Nis always nice, right?
0.5;His wife probably bought\Nthem before leaving...
0.5;It's been less than a day.\NWhy are they so wilted?
0.5;Say, Mr. Okida\Nliked Tokito-san, didn't he?
0.5;He made him his driver\Neven though he's young.
0.5;He and a friend started a\Nsoftware company two years ago,
0.5;As expected, he went\Nbankrupt a year later.
0.5;Six months ago,\Nhe apologized to Mr. Okida
0.5;and begged for another job--\Neven if he was just a driver.
0.5;So then Mr. Okida\Nmade him his chauffeur?
0.5;Yes. He was a\Nkindhearted person, after all.
0.5;He was making an example\Nto the other employees!
0.5;Tokito! Why the hell\Nweren't you paying attention?!
0.5;...he wouldn't have yelled\Nat him like that in public!
0.5;Say, what did you\Nand Tokito-san talk about?
0.5;You seemed to be\Nhaving a good time!
0.5;He said that long hair cats\Ndon't handle heat well,
0.5;so they need air-conditioned\Nrooms to live!
0.5;So if it was hot enough\Nin here to melt the chocolate,
0.5;But from what I saw,\Nit doesn't seem weakened at all!
0.5;I'm gonna go\Ntalk to Tokito-san too!
0.5;I hear you're actually\Na programmer?
0.5;I heard you set out\Non your own two years ago
0.5;and started a software\Ncompany with your friend.
0.5;When I grow up, I wanna\Nmake computer games too!
0.5;But I make business software,\Nnot games.
0.5;You went bankrupt in\Njust a year, right?
0.5;but then a certain\Nman got in the way...
0.5;And then he drove\Nmy friend to suicide!
0.5;Would that certain man\Nhappen to be Mr. Okida?
0.5;There are all kinds\Nof things in the adult world.
0.5;There's no question that Tokito-san\Nhated Mr. Okida enough to kill him.
0.5;He might've begged\Nfor another job to get revenge.
0.5;Tokito-san would\Nbe the prime suspect.
0.5;But how exactly\Ncould he have done it?!
0.5;It's possible for a home computer\Nconnected to a phone line
0.5;to infiltrate another\Nhome's computer system
0.5;and change its air\Nconditioning program, right?
0.5;For someone well-versed\Nin that field, that is.
0.5;Tokito-san is a first-rate programmer,\Nso he's definitely well-versed.
0.5;Oh, I was eating ice cream\Nearlier. I must've spilled some.
0.5;What a slob!\NNow I have to change my socks!
0.5;You're young so\Nit might not affect you,
0.5;but it's best not to make it\Ntoo much cooler than it is outside.
0.5;I once read an article about\Nhow someone had a heart attack
0.5;Probably because of the\Nsudden drop in temperature.
0.5;and then suddenly cooled\Nit down to cause a heart attack!
0.5;Maybe if the program\Nwas at that man's home,
0.5;but I doubt he would\Nactually hold on to it.
0.5;There's something\NI'd like you to make for me...
0.5;Nobody's ever asked\Nto come see my computer before!
0.5;It might be too early\Nfor you to have one...
0.5;Since you're here, want\Nto play some computer games?
0.5;It's the company's,\Nbut its alarm is going off!
0.5;I was playing poker\Nwith the computer!
0.5;From your expression, I take it\Nyou didn't find the program?
0.5;The only thing I learned was how\Nto play poker against a computer.
0.5;Oh yeah, I probably got it from Aslan\Nthis morning at Mr. Okida's house.
0.5;Aslan is a long-haired cat, so he'd\Nbe affected if a room got too hot.
0.5;I can't lay out a theory\Nunless I solve this puzzle.
0.5;Which means this hair\Ncame from Tokito-san's apartment...
0.5;Good to hear you\Nagain, Inspector.
0.5;There's something I'd like you\Nto investigate immediately
0.5;Mr. Tokito, the driver?\NUnderstood.
0.5;Why do I have to use\Nthis to fake my own voice?
0.5;Good morning!\NSorry for the early intrusion!
0.5;This Kudo kid sure\Nhas a good imagination!
0.5;I'd like to ask you about the day\Nbefore yesterday one more time...
0.5;Two nights ago, you put Mr. Okida\Nto bed and then immediately left, correct?
0.5;Are you sure you didn't do\Nanything out of the ordinary?
0.5;I'm almost certain you\Ntook his cat two days ago.
0.5;And then yesterday you took\NAslan back to the Okida home.
0.5;When Conan-kun came here yesterday,\Nsome cat hair got stuck to his feet!
0.5;But Tokito-san!\NThere's cat litter here!
0.5;These are used in litter boxes,\Nright, Ran-neechan?
0.5;Yeah, they stick to long\Nhair cats especially easily,
0.5;and they fall all over the\Nplace when they walk around.
0.5;There's no question\Nthat you took Aslan, is there?
0.5;You did it because you knew\Nsomething was going to happen
0.5;The entire house would\Nbecome unusually warm
0.5;You love animals,\Nso you took Aslan with you
0.5;because he would be\Naffected and possibly even die!
0.5;You're actually a\Nnice person, aren't you?
0.5;Computers were created\Nto enrich people's lives
0.5;Yet you used\None to kill somebody!
0.5;That means you've\Nbetrayed your own friend!
0.5;To be honest, I didn't\Nthink this would kill him.
0.5;Every program I write\Nis like a child to me.
0.5;Conan-kun. Could you tell this\NShinichi something for me?
0.5;I don't know in how many years it'll be,\Nbut when I start my next software company
0.5;For my student,\Nhe sure is meddling!
0.5;Didn't you say you saw Shinichi\Nat Professor Agasa's place yesterday?
0.5;Yeah! And when I told him about Mr. Okida\Nhe instantly knew that it was a murder!
0.5;Where is he now?\NYou know, don't you?!
0.5;Which means she was\Nstill alive at that time?
0.5;"Tatsumi-sensei was with me;\Nhis alibi is airtight."
0.5;And besides, the hotel\Nis ten kilometers from his home.
0.5;High school student Shinichi was forced\Nto take a drug that shrunk him.
0.5;Sorry for the wait!\NToday's Conan is a one-hour special!
0.5;Why does the famous detective Kogoro\NMori have to go to a stupid island
0.5;when he could be spending his\Ntime at a flower viewing party?!
0.5;It's all because of that letter\NI got a week ago!
0.5;shadows will once again begin to\Ndisappear from Tsukikage Island.
0.5;I've transferred half a million\Nto your bank account.
0.5;He didn't even bother for me\Nto accept him as a client or not!
0.5;At least we get to relax\Non a small island near Izu!
0.5;I don't see anyone\Nby that name in here...
0.5;I have a letter from him\Nright here, after all...
0.5;and I just moved to this island,\Nso I don't know that much about--
0.5;Chief, it seems that these people\Nhave been hired by a resident here...
0.5;That's right.\NBy someone named Keiji Aso...
0.5;That's not possible!\NHe's been dead for over 10 years!
0.5;He was a famous pianist who was born\Nand raised on this island.
0.5;It was the night of a full moon,\N12 years ago...
0.5;so he held a concert in\Nthe town's community center.
0.5;But afterwards, he suddenly shut his family\Nand himself inside their home
0.5;He allegedly stabbed his wife\Nand daughter to death
0.5;and then continued to play\Nthe piano as the fire raged on,
0.5;almost as if he was\Npossessed by something.
0.5;"Beethoven's piano sonata...\N""Moonlight."""
0.5;Your fee was paid, plus the letter\Nwas postmarked from this island.
0.5;I bet someone on the island wants\Nyou to look into Keiji Aso's affairs!
0.5;They said the mayor's over\Nat the community center, right?
0.5;Now then, Kenta-kun. Make sure\Nto keep warm when you sleep.
0.5;You turn that corner\Nand then keep going straight.
0.5;That's right. We got\Noff the ship just now.
0.5;But this island is so much nicer,\Nwouldn't you agree?
0.5;Protect the island's fishing industry!\NVote for Masato Shimizu!
0.5;The mayoral election\Nis coming up, you see.
0.5;and Kawashima-san,\Nthe wealthiest man on the island.
0.5;My patients have been telling me\Nthat Kawashima-san will probably--
0.5;That's alright, Nurse. We're not really\Nthat interested in the election...
0.5;If you folks are headed\Nto the community center,
0.5;Tonight they're holding a 3rd-year\Nmemorial for Kameyama-san,
0.5;How dare they do this on the night\Nof the previous mayor's memorial?!
0.5;Hirata! What're you doing?!\NShut them up already!
0.5;Don't let the mayor continue\Nhis reign of terror!
0.5;Indeed. It would seem the citizens\Nfavor me the most.
0.5;That's only because\Nyou know how to use money.
0.5;There's a man here\Nwho wants to see the mayor!
0.5;Come on, how long are\Nthey going to make me wait?!
0.5;So the rear of the community center\Nis on the water's edge...
0.5;You'd think they could at least\Nclean it once in a while...
0.5;That's the cursed piano that\NAso-san played the day he died!
0.5;The same thing happened\Nto the last mayor!
0.5;the person they're holding\Nthe memorial for today?
0.5;I was passing by the community center,\Nwhich should have been empty,
0.5;when I heard the sounds of\Na piano coming from inside.
0.5;When I called out to see who\Nwas there, the music stopped.
0.5;And the music he had been\Nplaying before he died
0.5;"was the same piece Aso-san had\Nperformed in the fire: ""Moonlight."""
0.5;After that, this piano came to\Nbe known as the Cursed Piano.
0.5;Anyway, please wait by the front door\Nuntil the memorial is over!
0.5;Narumi-san! Are you\Ngoing to the memorial?
0.5;Yes. Kameyama-san was the first person\NI autopsied when I came here.
0.5;I thought I would burn\Nsome incense in his honor.
0.5;Oh, this is Shimizu-san.\NI happened to meet him on the way.
0.5;Hello, my name's Shimizu.\Nlt's nice to meet you!
0.5;You hired a detective to dig up\Nsome dirt on me, didn't you?!
0.5;That piano should have remained\Nunused for years now,
0.5;And what exactly was\Nthat letter trying to say?
0.5;That letter warned that another\Nperson on Tsukikage Island
0.5;It's the curse!\NIt's the curse of the piano!
0.5;There's no curse. It's this tape recorder\Nthat's playing the music.
0.5;This was a murder designed to resemble\Nthe previous two incidents!
0.5;Hey now, don't be getting\Nahead of yourself.
0.5;I'm a famous detective from Tokyo--\NKogoro Mori!
0.5;No, he's the one in\Nall those mystery novels.
0.5;Approximate time of death\Nwas 30 minutes to an hour ago.
0.5;I can't say any more\Nwithout performing an autopsy.
0.5;See, there's a suit jacket\Non the beach outside.
0.5;There's a trail of water here that\Ngoes from the door to the piano
0.5;And judging from the fact that the door\Nand windows were all locked,
0.5;and that the first few minutes\Nof the cassette tape are blank...
0.5;The killer probably took Kawashima-san\Nto the ocean during the memorial,
0.5;turned the tape recorder on,\Nand then exited into the hallway.
0.5;Assuming the door\Nto this room was locked,
0.5;there's a high possibility the killer\Nreturned to the memorial afterwards,
0.5;since we were at the\Nfront door the whole time!
0.5;Are you saying the killer's\Nstill among us?!
0.5;Did anyone here see Kawashima-san\Nleave his seat?
0.5;I saw him. He said he was\Ngoing to the restroom.
0.5;Did anybody see anyone else\Nleave their seat?
0.5;As if we could remember\Nevery little thing that happened.
0.5;In that case, did anyone have\Nany grudges with Kawashima-san?
0.5;but the person most happy about\Nhis death would be Shimizu-kun,
0.5;What?! The same goes for you,\NMayor Kuroiwa!
0.5;Daddy's victory would\Npractically be guaranteed!
0.5;wasn't plotting to steal\NKawashima-san's votes, of course.
0.5;But why did the killer\Nput the body in this room?
0.5;Because the killer wanted to place\Nthe blame on the cursed piano.
0.5;Say, just how long has\Nthis piano been here?
0.5;It's been here ever since\NAso-san donated it 15 years ago.
0.5;Yes. His name is even\Non the keyboard lid.
0.5;That's strange. This wasn't here\Nwhen we checked this afternoon.
0.5;He did rather well\Nfor himself back in the day.
0.5;I hear he spent lots of money\Non alcohol, women, and gambling...
0.5;he stopped going out, almost as if\Nhe were afraid of something.
0.5;Wasn't he a childhood\Nfriend of yours, Mayor?
0.5;But I had to look for him,\Nhe wasn't at the police station!
0.5;We can put off collecting information\Nuntil tomorrow morning.
0.5;This was no murder.\NIt was Aso-san's curse.
0.5;They should just burn\Nthat creepy old piano!
0.5;Yeah. Maybe we'd be better off\Nwithout that thing.
0.5;Your deductions sure\Nsurprised me, Conan-kun!
0.5;Everyone was talking about\Nhow amazing his persuasiveness was!
0.5;I was just pretending\Nto be like Detective Kogoro!
0.5;I'd rather not have to\Nexamine any more bodies.
0.5;Don't you worry! This'll be a\Npiece of cake with me at the helm!
0.5;Whatever. Not even I really know\Nwhat's going on yet...
0.5;What? This murder spree\Nhas yet to continue?
0.5;"""Shadows disappearing""\Nmeans ""being enveloped by light."""
0.5;Light stands for the song played at\Nall the murder scenes--Moonlight!
0.5;The song Mr. Aso played\Nin the fire 12 years ago...
0.5;And the song the mayor played\Nbefore he died 2 years ago...
0.5;It was Beethoven's\Npiano sonata, Moonlight.
0.5;And all three incidents have\Ntaken place beside the piano.
0.5;Ran! Let's go to the\Ncommunity center too!
0.5;Spending a night\Nwith a corpse like this...
0.5;Tell me, who moved the body\Nwithout permission?
0.5;I felt bad for the poor guy,\Nbeing stuck in that position...
0.5;we're not through investigating\Nthe crime scene yet...
0.5;Oh, I took that so it\Nwouldn't get lost. See?
0.5;If so, then the killer\Nmight come back for it!
0.5;When I asked for you at the hotel,\Nthey said you were all here...
0.5;No. I return to Tokyo\Non the weekends.
0.5;It's almost like I work\Nas a part-time doctor here!
0.5;I've always wanted to work\Non a small island like this,
0.5;Did Mayor Kameyama really die\Nof a heart attack two years ago?
0.5;almost as if he saw\Nsomething horrifying...
0.5;Did you notice anything\Nstrange at the time?
0.5;I believe we chalked that up to\Nsomeone forgetting to close it, but...
0.5;I was right! He did come back\Nto get this sheet music!
0.5;Okay! We're going to stay up all night\Nand keep watch over this place!
0.5;Inspector Megure-dono...\NWhat are you doing here?
0.5;If you're looking for the sheet music,\NConan-kun gave it to me.
0.5;He also gave me the\Ngist of the situation here.
0.5;All three of them were still awake\Nby the time I arrived.
0.5;You and that old man\Nwere the only ones asleep.
0.5;They're interrogating people\Nover at the town hall.
0.5;Dad! Well? Did you\Nfigure out who did it?
0.5;Yeah, right. There were\N38 people at the memorial.
0.5;You seem exhausted,\Nso you're scheduled to be last.
0.5;In that case, I think I'll go\Nwash my face in the ladies' room.
0.5;and Ken Nishimoto, who we're\Ninterviewing right now,
0.5;He won't say a word,\Nno matter what we ask him.
0.5;As long as that thing's around,\Nthese murders will keep happening!
0.5;Dispose of it immediately!\NYou hear me, Hirata?!
0.5;I have no motive\Nfor killing Kawashima-san!
0.5;She's been shouting\Nfor 10 minutes straight.
0.5;They're through questioning him,\Nso why isn't Nishimoto-san leaving?
0.5;Huh? Did Nishimoto-san\Ncome in here just now?
0.5;The autopsy team left for Tokyo\Nthis evening to work on Kawashima-san.
0.5;But now this narrows down the suspects\Nto a handful of people!
0.5;All the exits to this building\Nare guarded by police.
0.5;It appears only a few minutes\Nhave passed since the victim's death.
0.5;Yes, the first 5 minutes and 30 seconds\Nof this tape seem to be blank.
0.5;There was something strange\Nbeneath the body!
0.5;Is this another dying message\Nfrom the victim?
0.5;If he had the time and strength\Nto write all this with his own blood,
0.5;The killer probably left\Neach of these behind to--
0.5;Seeing as Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata\Nwas played after each murder,
0.5;it would seem the same person killed\NKawashima-san and Kuroiwa-san.
0.5;around 6:30, only minutes\Nbefore he was found.
0.5;since you were the only ones\Nin the community center at the time!
0.5;that leaves us with Ken Nishimoto-san,\Nwho was the first to find him,
0.5;Dr. Narumi Asai, who was kind enough\Nto inspect the body for us just now,
0.5;Kazuaki Hirata-san,\Nsecretary to the late Mayor Kuroiwa,
0.5;Mayor Kuroiwa's daughter,\NReiko Kuroiwa-san
0.5;And then Masato Shimizu-san,\Ncandidate in the mayoral election.
0.5;You're right,\Nyou couldn't have done it...
0.5;So that leaves the four men\Nas the only suspects...
0.5;Excuse me, but I've been\Non this floor since 6:00 or so...
0.5;Do you have anyone\Nto substantiate this?
0.5;You were the first person\Nto find Kuroiwa-san...
0.5;Are you sure you didn't ask\Nto see him so you could kill him?!
0.5;With Kawashima and my father\Ntaken out of the election,
0.5;he'd automatically wind up\Nin the mayor's seat!
0.5;The sheet music the killer\Nleft at the murder scene.
0.5;My guess is that it's a\Ncoded message from the murderer.
0.5;Those are the black keys\Non the keyboard. You know?
0.5;Arrest this homicidal maniac\Nbefore he kills anyone else--
0.5;This code's easy if\Nyou know how to read it.
0.5;It's based on the notes that\Ncorrespond with specific piano keys
0.5;if you arrange the letters of the\Nalphabet across a piano keyboard.
0.5;Using this, the music found where\NKawashima-san was killed says,
0.5;"""Extinguished is the anger\Nof the hellfire."""
0.5;...that pianist who killed himself\Nin a fire 12 years ago?!
0.5;The bones found in the ashes\Nmatched his dental records--
0.5;All that was left was some\Nsheet music in a fireproof safe.
0.5;But the key to the storeroom's\Nback at the station--
0.5;Say, did Aso-san really\Nset his own house on fire?
0.5;Mayor Kuroiwa, Nishimoto-san,\Nand Kawashima-san.
0.5;They were all classmates,\Nincluding Aso-san.
0.5;He and the mayor's daughter Reiko-san\Nwere engaged not too long ago.
0.5;What about Hirata,\Nthe mayor's secretary?
0.5;but he was always sneaking\Naround with Kawashima-san
0.5;He has a strong sense of justice and\Nhe's very popular with the fishermen!
0.5;I could swear it was\Naround here somewhere...
0.5;Come on. You've been\Nlooking for over an hour now.
0.5;Everyone grew tired of waiting\Nso they went home!
0.5;so they figured there\Nwould be no more murders.
0.5;Only the 1st and 2nd movements\Nof Moonlight have been played
0.5;I'm going to check out\Nthe community center!
0.5;Did you just hear a strange sound\Ncome from the piano room?
0.5;There's some more sheet music\Nat Nishimoto-san's feet!
0.5;he regretted killing Mr. Kawashima\Nand Mr. Kuroiwa...
0.5;He apparently didn't want an old mistake\Nthey made to be made known.
0.5;"""They"" refers to Mr. Kameyama,\Nwho died 2 years ago,"
0.5;Mr. Kawashima and Mr. Kuroiwa,\Nwho were just killed,
0.5;and Mr. Aso, who killed himself\N12 years ago.
0.5;My guess is that they did something,\Nusing this code.
0.5;I see. Nishimoto-san was afraid\Ntheir old secret would get out
0.5;so he broke into the storeroom\Nto destroy the sheet music.
0.5;But unable to find the music and\Ndriven into a psychological corner,
0.5;It's impossible to hang yourself\Nwithout something to support you, right?
0.5;And I doubt there's anyone who would\Ngo and write their own will in code.
0.5;Are you saying the murderer\Nis somewhere else?
0.5;Dr. Narumi's treating him\Nin the piano room right now.
0.5;You still haven't found\NMr. Aso's sheet music?!
0.5;It was 12 years ago. There's no way\Nfor me to remember where we put it.
0.5;Yes. I think he may have\Nsuffered a concussion.
0.5;What was Murasawa-san\Ndoing here this late anyway?
0.5;Don't ask me! But it\Nwas important to Shuichi!
0.5;That's a tuning hammer,\Nused to tune pianos.
0.5;The suspicious person\Nwho ran out of this room
0.5;was looking for something\Nunder the piano.
0.5;Judging from the methods\Nemployed in all three murders,
0.5;they are all clearly\Nthe work of the same person!
0.5;Dr. Narumi and Reiko Kuroiwa-san\Nhave confirmed alibis
0.5;But there are no alibis\Nfor the secretary Hirata-san,
0.5;nor for Murasawa-san, who is\Ncurrently resting at the clinic...
0.5;Dr. Narumi. Is Murasawa-san\Nstill unconscious?
0.5;Yes. Reiko-san is looking after him,\Nbut he has yet to regain consciousness.
0.5;Ever since I saw the code of blood\Nleft at the scene of the crime...
0.5;The photos taken from where\NMr. Kuroiwa was murdered are ready!
0.5;It's off in the picture\Nwhere he's been moved.
0.5;Um, may I buy some juice?\NI'm thirsty...
0.5;There's some white powder\Non your sleeves.
0.5;I finally found the sheet music\NAso-san left behind!
0.5;Oh, come to think of it,\NAso-san had a son too...
0.5;He fell seriously ill when he was little\Nand had to be hospitalized...
0.5;Hey, wait! Where do you\Nthink you're going?!
0.5;The reason the killer dragged\NKawashima-san into the piano room
0.5;The meaning of the music\Nplayed at the murder scenes!
0.5;And the mystery behind\Nthe code written in blood!
0.5;There's no doubt about it!\NThat's the one who did it!
0.5;Mr. Mori received a\Nletter from a dead man
0.5;The letter's author was Keiji Aso,\Na pianist who murdered his family,
0.5;lit his house on fire, and died\Nwhile playing the Moonlight piano sonata.
0.5;The 1st murder happened on the night\Nof the memorial for Mr. Kameyama,
0.5;Hideo Kawashima was\Nfound dead in the piano room,
0.5;while the first movement\Nof Moonlight played.
0.5;The second murder took place\Nas the second movement played.
0.5;The number of suspects was\Nnarrowed down to six people.
0.5;He was killed in a manner\Nthat made it look like suicide.
0.5;The reason the killer dragged\NKawashima-san into the piano room
0.5;The meaning of the music\Nplayed at the murder scenes!
0.5;And the mystery behind\Nthe code written in blood!
0.5;There's no doubt about it!\NThat's the one who did it!
0.5;What's the big idea, rushing here\Nto the broadcast room like that?!
0.5;I've got no choice! I'll have to\Nuse the old man's voice for this!
0.5;One shot of this\NAnesthetic Watch Gun and...
0.5;Hirata-san and Shimizu-san will\Nhave to come to the mainland with us
0.5;The first incident, in which\NMr. Kawashima was drowned
0.5;and dragged into the community center's\Npiano room last night...
0.5;The second incident,\Nin which Mr. Kuroiwa was murdered
0.5;in the broadcast room\Nthis very night...
0.5;The third incident, which also\Ntook place this very night,
0.5;in which Mr. Nishimoto\Nwas killed in the storeroom
0.5;in such a way to make\Nit look like a suicide...
0.5;The only ones without alibis for\Nthese three incidents are you two
0.5;and Murasawa-san,\Nwho is resting at the clinic.
0.5;I'm sorry to do this, but we'll\Nhave to watch you tonight.
0.5;Almost everything about the murders\Non this island, that is.
0.5;First, the person who beat Murasawa-san\Nunconscious in the piano room.
0.5;Hirata-san suffered\Nthe injury on his left hand
0.5;He was making deals with\NMr. Kawashima in that room.
0.5;Hirata-san used a\Nhidden panel in the piano
0.5;to trade drugs he bought overseas\Nfor large sums of money.
0.5;Aha! So that's why they were at the\Ncommunity center every single night!
0.5;The reason Hirata-san always\Nclaimed the piano was cursed
0.5;was to keep people\Nfrom getting in the way.
0.5;He probably assaulted\NMurasawa-san and escaped
0.5;because Murasawa-san saw him taking\Nback the drugs he had left there!
0.5;If he was the murderer, he wouldn't\Nhave killed anyone in the piano room.
0.5;That was the room where\Nhe left the drugs, after all.
0.5;The reason the killer wrote a\Nwill to make it look a suicide
0.5;but didn't place an object\Nto stand on in the room
0.5;was because the murderer bolted\Nwhen Ran and the others showed up.
0.5;So far, our image of the\Nkiller has been that of a man,
0.5;because all three murders\Nrequired someone with strength.
0.5;Next, we need to look\Nat the second murder.
0.5;At room temperature, it takes 15\Nto 30 minutes for human blood to dry.
0.5;even though he was supposedly\Nkilled only minutes before.
0.5;That's right. It was a trick the killer\Ndid to alter the estimated time of death.
0.5;But only the first 5 and a half minutes\Nof the tape were blank!
0.5;The killer played the 2nd side\Nof the tape, which had no music on it
0.5;and gained 30 extra minutes\Nby using tape reverse.
0.5;There's a button lit\Nnear Kuroiwa-san's neck.
0.5;And the light is off\Njust after his body is moved.
0.5;But if I remember correctly,\Nthe one who approached the body was--
0.5;The person who faked\Nthe estimated time of death...
0.5;...was the one who inspected\Nthe body--you, Dr. Narumi!
0.5;You drowned Kawashima-san and\Ndragged him into the piano room
0.5;in order to send the coroners\Nback to the mainland,
0.5;was so that you could throw us off\Nby faking the time of the 2nd murder.
0.5;Doing this, you altered\NKuroiwa-san's time of death,
0.5;The motive for the murders\Nextends 12 years back.
0.5;Back to the incident in which pianist\NKeiji Aso and his family were killed.
0.5;Kawashima-san, Nishimoto-san,\NKuroiwa-san,
0.5;But then Aso-san said he\Nrefused to help them any longer.
0.5;they shut him and his family inside\Nhis house and set it on fire.
0.5;This is all written in the sheet music\Nthat survived that fire...
0.5;In the confession letter\Nthat Aso-san wrote for his child...
0.5;Asai is probably his\Nfoster family's last name.
0.5;The place where Aso Keiji's donated\Npiano is kept--the community center!
0.5;It's written in this sheet\Nmusic your dad left for you!
0.5;How did you find out about your father\Nif you haven't read this?!
0.5;I came to this island\Nas a woman doctor.
0.5;It doesn't say on my license\Nhow to pronounce my name, after all.
0.5;They would've found out\NI was really a man.
0.5;I see. So that's why you\Nstayed with us that night--
0.5;so you could have them\Nquestion you last.
0.5;When I told Kameyama, the previous mayor,\Nthat I was Aso's son,
0.5;he suddenly grew fearful\Nand told me everything.
0.5;He finished it all off by falling\Nlifeless from a heart attack.
0.5;It was when I played my father's\Nfavorite piece, Moonlight,
0.5;as a farewell song for him that I came up\Nwith the idea for these murders.
0.5;Seiji! Let's get out of here!\NWe can still make it!
0.5;These hands are as\Nbloodstained as theirs are.
0.5;Murasawa-san missed Keiji Aso,\Nthe pianist,
0.5;so he apparently tuned\Nhis piano on occasion...
0.5;Why did Dr. Narumi warn us\Nabout the murders?
0.5;My only guess is that it was actually\Na letter of challenge to Dad...
0.5;I think she wanted to be\Nstopped from killing...
0.5;Say, what did the code\Nthat Dr. Narumi played say?
0.5;Don't tell me the car\NAyumi-chan got in
0.5;belonged to those kidnappers\Nwho're killing little girls!
0.5;Hold on, Ayumi-chan!\NWe're coming to save you!
0.5;Ran, Sonoko, and I came to a rental \Nvilla deep in the mountains.
0.5;"...of the murderer known\Nas the ""Red Woman."""
0.5;"to solve the mysterious ""red"" \Noccurrences happening at the rental villa."
0.5;A refreshing autumn breeze \Nblows through the gaiety
0.5;of summer for a stylish and \Ndashing display of deduction.
0.5;Even Sonoko witnesses the \Nshadow of the Red Woman!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;He came to stay at this rental villa\Nwith a few friends on vacation.
0.5;Hakuya-san arrived at this \Nrental villa this afternoon.
0.5;when he and his friends \Nsplit up to clean the villa.
0.5;Later his friends discovered\Nhim in the water
0.5;No, it belongs to the boy \Nvisiting the rental villa.
0.5;Are you sure you didn't get \Nexcited when you saw Ran naked?
0.5;...drowned in the bathwater after \Nbeing knocked unconscious...
0.5;...by a blow from a blunt object \Nto the back of his head.
0.5;We each had specific roles \Nevery year we came here.
0.5;If I had helped Hakuya \Ninstead of going shopping,
0.5;I didn't see him after he left the living\Nroom to clean the bathrooms after lunch.
0.5;He wasn't here when I\Nlooked in the bathroom.
0.5;I thought Hakuya-kun had\Ndrawn a bath for us.
0.5;We uncovered the bath to check \Nthe temperature of the water.
0.5;But there weren't any tomatoes \Nfloating in the bathwater then.
0.5;And Sumika-san found all these \Ntomatoes in the bathtub.
0.5;Conan-kun and I ran here \Nwhen we heard the commotion.
0.5;We discovered Hakuya-san's body when \Nwe pulled him out of the water.
0.5;you couldn't see his body \Nuntil after you pulled it out?
0.5;and dumbbells had been placed on his \Nbody to prevent it from floating.
0.5;In other words, after sinking \Nthe body in the bath,
0.5;the culprit covered the water's \Nsurface with tomatoes to hide it.
0.5;He's probably asking in what \Norder you entered the bathroom.
0.5;If the first person to enter \Nhad a bag of tomatoes,
0.5;She entered wearing just a \Ntowel to uncover the tub.
0.5;Besides, someone would've noticed a \Nbag containing that many tomatoes.
0.5;it seems the crime was committed between \Nthe time Ran-chan and the others
0.5;Can you tell us what you two \Nwere doing during that time?
0.5;It's about a fifteen minute walk\Nto the store a kilometer away.
0.5;He gave us cold canned beverages \Nto drink while we walked back.
0.5;I gave the drinks to them \Nright after I bought them.
0.5;We ran into each other in \Nthe forest near the store.
0.5;Conan-kun and I were walking \Naround in the forest.
0.5;I-I was cleaning up after lunch\Nand prepping for dinner.
0.5;But I was talking to those \Ntwo through the kitchen door.
0.5;We were cleaning the living room \Nin front of the kitchen then.
0.5;Tamami-san asked us what \Nwe wanted for dinner.
0.5;No. Sumika-san was cleaning \Nthe second floor by herself.
0.5;After that, the three of \Nus were cleaning together.
0.5;And it's true Sumika-san was cleaning the \Nsecond floor the whole time until then.
0.5;and we could hear it bumping\Nagainst walls, too.
0.5;the only person who could have \Ncommitted the crime is Tamami-san,
0.5;I really was in the kitchen until \NNinda-kun came back from shopping!
0.5;She couldn't have secretly committed \Nthe murder on the first floor.
0.5;Besides, Tamami could never\Ndo something like that.
0.5;That red demon who\Ncommitted that murder
0.5;fifteen years ago in\Nthe rental villa near here.
0.5;She must have been hiding \Nin the woods somewhere.
0.5;and filled the hot water \Nheater with red rose petals,
0.5;B-But why did the Red\NWoman kill Hakuya-kun?
0.5;The Red Woman doesn't know \Nabout Sumika's cleaning habits,
0.5;so she broke in and happened to kill \NHakuya without anyone seeing her,
0.5;leaving red tomatoes in the \Nbathwater to remind us of her!
0.5;But the news said she was still \Non the run the other day.
0.5;Did you know a woman's body was found in\Na swamp three years after the incident?
0.5;three years old was also \Ndiscovered in the swamp.
0.5;Because the murder weapon \Nwas found next to the body,
0.5;Takeno set fire to her \Nhouse before the murder.
0.5;and we couldn't perform a \NDNA test for a long time.
0.5;we learned she had been \Nhiding her umbilical cord.
0.5;When we compared it to the DNA \Nfrom the skeleton's bone marrow,
0.5;We were planning on announcing \Nit to the media tomorrow.
0.5;the Nagano prefectural police are \Nin chaos trying to handle it.
0.5;Don't tell me it was the \Nghost of the Red Woman!
0.5;Could the three of you wait in your rooms\Nuntil we're finished with the investigation?
0.5;This is your bat for driving\Noff the Red Woman.
0.5;Why is there a fan in this room \Nwhen it has air conditioning?
0.5;Maybe a guest who doesn't \Nlike air conditioning
0.5;The thing weighing down \Nthe body in the bathwater?
0.5;Also, I stole this tomato \Nfrom the crime scene.
0.5;It really seems like the Red Woman's \Ngoing to make an appearance.
0.5;I thought I saw a woman with long\Nhair standing outside the window...
0.5;Also, let's gather in the living room\Nuntil the power comes back on.
0.5;Hey, is the power really \Nout in the whole area?
0.5;It'll take some time to \Nget the power back up.
0.5;of the coincidental power \Noutage to attack her?
0.5;Could the umbilical cord\Nused to test her DNA
0.5;Family members attested \Nthe Red Woman's mother
0.5;refused to hand over the \Numbilical cord to the police,
0.5;because she refused to admit \Nher daughter was dead.
0.5;There is something strange \Nabout the case, though.
0.5;we've been receiving crime \Nreports from the rental villas
0.5;They're not like the pranks \Nyou just mentioned,
0.5;like breaking windows and \Nthrowing something inside.
0.5;Some people have witnessed \Nuncanny figures in the forest.
0.5;couldn't be certain the skeleton in \Nthe swamp belonged to the Red Woman.
0.5;Th-Then the person I saw \Nfrom my window just now...
0.5;D-Does the ghost of the \NRed Woman really exist?
0.5;If we don't get out of \Nhere, we... We'll all be...
0.5;and sorcerers only live \Nin the world of fantasy.
0.5;Not a single one of them \Nexists in this world.
0.5;Even if she is around, she's \Na flesh and blood person.
0.5;We can neutralize her with my \Njeet kune do or Ran-kun's karate.
0.5;You seem like more than just \None of Ran-chan's classmates.
0.5;She's the younger sister \Nof our classmate Sera-kun.
0.5;We asked her and her\Nfriends to come to solve
0.5;the mysterious incidents that \Noccurred at this rental villa.
0.5;Sera's busy, but he said \Nhis little detective sister
0.5;had just come back from America \Nand didn't have anything to do.
0.5;Does this mean you're finally making \Na serious effort to win a major title?
0.5;Yeah, since I won my first domestic \Ntournament the other day.
0.5;Oh, is that why you invited me \Nhere so early in the morning?
0.5;and I'd like to reset everything \Nand start with a blank slate.
0.5;It seems like you've been making \Nmoney off your photo collections.
0.5;If I give you that much, I won't \Nbe able to go on tour anymore.
0.5;He'll take everything you \Nhave, so prepare yourself.
0.5;Just so you know, you can't \Ndistract me with a meal.
0.5;Although you'll probably \Nkeep making it for me.
0.5;There's a troubled couple living \Nin an upper floor apartment.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;General, the tiger is afraid \Nof me and won't come out!
0.5;Every night this tiger leaves \Nits screen and causes trouble!
0.5;I wasn't sure how it would turn out \Nsince you've been skipping rehearsal,
0.5;Actually, I once played this role \Nmy third year of grade school.
0.5;Who would like to play the role of \NIkkyu-san in the upcoming play?
0.5;You're going to be playing \NIkkyu-san in your upcoming play?
0.5;You need to put yourself \Nin Ikkyu-san's shoes.
0.5;Are you trying to embarrass the \Ngreat actress Fujimine Yukiko?
0.5;So that's why you weren't \Ntaking rehearsal serious.
0.5;but you could paint it once you get \Nhome today and bring it in tomorrow?
0.5;if the tiger is the right \Nsize for Conan-kun's body.
0.5;Then can I count on you to \Nrecreate the tiger screen?
0.5;Yes. I'll take the children \Nhome once we're finished.
0.5;You live in a high-rise \Napartment, Wakasa-sensei?
0.5;Now we just have to glue it to \Ncardboard once the paint dries.
0.5;In that case, to thank you for helping \Nme, I'll make you some omu-rice.
0.5;Anyway, did you call your parents \Nto tell them you'd be home late?
0.5;Apparently he plays music on a \Ntimer instead of setting an alarm.
0.5;And you shouldn't come barging \Ninto people's homes uninvited.
0.5;C-Come to think of it, a strange \Nwoman zapped me in my doorway.
0.5;A strange woman suddenly showed \Nup at my place this evening.
0.5;The moment I opened the door, she zapped \Nme with a stun gun and knocked me out.
0.5;When I came to, these kids were in \Nmy apartment and were yelling.
0.5;That's when I saw my girlfriend Kurumi \Non the floor, bleeding from her head.
0.5;By the way, what about those red \Nletters on your right cheek?
0.5;The one who knocked you \Nout with the stun gun?
0.5;This Polaroid that was on the \Nfloor next to me proves it.
0.5;This woman with white hands \Nis writing on my cheek.
0.5;She must've entered without realizing \Nthat strange woman was inside.
0.5;And that woman killed her when \Nthey ran into each other.
0.5;Men put foundation and \Nnail polish on their hands
0.5;and take selfies to make it look \Nlike they have girlfriends.
0.5;And I couldn't write this \Nclearly on my own face.
0.5;Anyway, officers, can I erase \Nthis writing on my face?
0.5;Do you remember what the \Nwoman who knocked you out
0.5;Yeah, but since I lost \Nconsciousness almost instantly,
0.5;She was wearing a broad-brimmed \Nhat and sunglasses.
0.5;We saw her standing in front \Nof the door to this apartment.
0.5;When she realized he wasn't home, she \Nbanged on the door and clicked her tongue.
0.5;I had my first win the other day \Nand published a photo collection.
0.5;Are you the professional \Ngolfer Banno Teigo-san?
0.5;Th-Then the murdered woman is the model \Nyou were rumored to have been dating...
0.5;So you have all these trophies because \Nyou're a professional golfer.
0.5;Oh, uh... they're records of \Nthe tours I've participated in.
0.5;I finally got them organized \Nrecently, so try not to touch them.
0.5;By the way, why did the \Nmurdered Iyama-san come here?
0.5;Oh, I'm their assistant \Nhomeroom teacher Wakasa Rumi.
0.5;Today the children helped \Nme paint the screen
0.5;So we came to check things out and \Nfound the front door unlocked.
0.5;This morning on my way to school \NI passed by this apartment.
0.5;I think he said he wasn't taking her \Nwith him on his international tour.
0.5;And she demanded he pay her \Ndamages for breaking up with her.
0.5;He said he'd cook for her so they \Ncould talk about it tonight.
0.5;We didn't smell any food when \Nwe entered the apartment.
0.5;Yeah, but when the strange woman rang \Nyour doorbell, you were out, right?
0.5;You should've bought the \Ningredients on your way home.
0.5;In any case, see if any of the other \Nresidents have seen the woman.
0.5;And Wakasa-sensei, could you return \Nto your apartment with the children?
0.5;I would've taken a photo of that \Nwoman ringing the doorbell.
0.5;It smells like the cosmetics \Nsection of a department store.
0.5;Did Wakasa-sensei spill \Nsome of her cosmetics?
0.5;The person who killed the \Nmodel Iyama Kurumi-san is
0.5;There really was a woman wearing a \Nbroad-brimmed hat and sunglasses.
0.5;It was probably that woman in \Nthe photo with white hands.
0.5;These children claimed to \Nhave figured something out.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NWoman With White Hands, Part Two!"""
0.5;Did you see the God of Ramen \NChampionship on TV last night?
0.5;I wanted to try the miso ramen \Nthat made it to the final.
0.5;The shoyu ramen that won the \Ncompetition must taste the best.
0.5;Come to think of it, the tonkotsu \Nramen seemed pretty good, too.
0.5;High school girls get way too \Nexcited over ramen specials.
0.5;The curliness of the noodles \Nis just so exquisite.
0.5;my dad said he was going out to \Ndrink with the neighbors tonight.
0.5;Could you cancel my spot \Nat tonight's French dinner?
0.5;I've dreamed about eating ramen on the \Nway home from school with my friends!
0.5;After all, the flavor's \Napparently to die for.
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the\Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Saizu-san's possession that \Nthey covered in poison.
0.5;As soon as you enter a warm \Nplace like a ramen shop,
0.5;Sera-chan, are you going to eat \Nrice and pot stickers for dinner?
0.5;Yeah, it's for my boyfriend \Nwho secretly lives with me.
0.5;Could you pass me the \Nvinegar in front of you?
0.5;You should use up the old \None before asking for more.
0.5;Hey, did the three people who \Njust left come in together?
0.5;but they just happened to \Ncome at the same time today.
0.5;Do you think the three \Nof them are suspicious?
0.5;an incident occurred while \Nthe three of them were here.
0.5;A bunch of police officers \Ncame into the shop.
0.5;A woman who lived in the neighborhood \Nwas the victim of a robbery murder.
0.5;And apparently they were \Ntaken to the station.
0.5;A couple of lady cops with \Nslanted and droopy eyes
0.5;Did they have any expensive \Nclothes or bags or accessories?
0.5;Even if they ordered two bowls \Nof ramen instead of one,
0.5;it wouldn't tell you much about \Ntheir financial situation...
0.5;I don't think they were \Ndressed any differently.
0.5;You chased the culprit of the \Nrobbery murder into the shop?
0.5;A week ago while Yumi-san and \NI were patrolling the area,
0.5;we spotted a suspicious \Nfigure outside a house.
0.5;There was a get-together at \Nthe shopping center that day,
0.5;so most of the shops had their lights \Noff, and there weren't many passers-by.
0.5;So the customers in the shop then \Nwere the three people who just left?
0.5;Later we stopped the three \Nof them in the shop.
0.5;go to the house where we \Nspotted the suspicious figure.
0.5;and bleeding from her head \Nin the entryway of her home.
0.5;When you consider she was \Nattacked on her way home
0.5;from picking up something she \Nforgot from her workplace,
0.5;the victim probably ran into \Nthe robber in the entryway.
0.5;It escalated into a fight, \Nand she was murdered.
0.5;And the lady cops didn't \Nshow up until a while later.
0.5;Apparently, she tripped \Nwhile chasing the culprit.
0.5;Your droopy eyes aren't as cute \Nwhen you're angry, you know.
0.5;He always said he was busy \Nwhen I tried to ask him out.
0.5;probably would be in high demand \Nfor TV and magazine interviews.
0.5;And if they have stubble, \Nit's practically guaranteed.
0.5;so if he shaved and dressed properly, \Nhe'd probably get all the girls.
0.5;"He always says, ""I'm the best in Japan \Nat memorizing those kinds of things."""
0.5;While I was chasing him, \Nthe culprit threw a hose at me.
0.5;It was a thick one with a \Nthree centimeter diameter.
0.5;The victim probably used it \Nto water their flower beds.
0.5;they were swinging the hose around \Nin the entryway of the victim's house.
0.5;Since there were signs that packing tape \Nhad been stuck to the end of the hose,
0.5;we thought they had taped something \Nto it and bludgeoned her to death.
0.5;Were they really doing that in \Nfront of the victim's house?
0.5;what else could they have been doing \Nwith the hose next to the body?
0.5;When she ran into the robber in \Nthe entryway, they got into a fight.
0.5;she probably hit her head \Non the edge of the stairs.
0.5;But weren't there signs that packing tape \Nhad been stuck to the end of the hose?
0.5;If the culprit had taped something \Nto the end of the hose,
0.5;maybe the victim fell \Nwhile trying to avoid it.
0.5;so it's clear she ran into the robber \Nbefore she entered the house.
0.5;They didn't have time to put \Ntogether some kind of weapon.
0.5;the culprit taped something to the end of \Nthe hose after they committed the murder.
0.5;to the end of the hose and swinging \Nit around over running away.
0.5;Maybe they were signaling their \Nrobber friends with the noise!
0.5;than taping something to \Na hose to make some noise.
0.5;they would've brought \Nsomething to make the noise.
0.5;But how did you know the \Nhose came from that house?
0.5;Which means the culprit was forced \Nto use that hose for some reason.
0.5;What could be more important \Nthan fleeing the crime scene?
0.5;So when you chased the culprit \Ninto this ramen shop,
0.5;Apparently they were taken \Nto the police station.
0.5;They willingly accompanied \NMiwako and Takagi-kun.
0.5;Then didn't one of them have \Npacking tape on their person?
0.5;threw the tape at me when \Nthey threw the hose.
0.5;Do you know what the three of \Nthem had on them at the time?
0.5;a wallet, cigarettes, \Na lighter, a cell phone,
0.5;chewing gum, a handkerchief, tissues, \Nand her house key inside her handbag.
0.5;his house key, and a glasses \Ncase inside his jacket pockets.
0.5;company documents, and a hand towel \Nin his clothes pockets and briefcase.
0.5;You searched the inside \Nof the shop, too, right?
0.5;so they weren't able to \Ndetermine who wore them.
0.5;They concluded that Miike and \NI had let the culprit escape,
0.5;B-But if the lady cops associated with \Nthat case came here every day,
0.5;do you really think the culprit would \Nbother coming here to eat ramen?
0.5;If I were the culprit, \NI'd be too scared to come.
0.5;The victim Tonda Atsuko-san \Nand Shono-san
0.5;But they'd lost contact since Shono-san \Nstarted working at another shop last year.
0.5;Apparently there wasn't any \Nconnection between them.
0.5;That certainly makes it \Neasier to rob someone.
0.5;In that case, Nakanishi-san's \Njust as suspicious.
0.5;Nakanishi-san was a regular \Nat Tonda-san's store.
0.5;So is it true that none of them have been \Nacting any differently since the murder?
0.5;Shono started putting a lot \Nof vinegar in her ramen,
0.5;Mizushina started ordering \Ndumplings all the time.
0.5;And Nakanishi started ordering two \Nbowls of ramen instead of one.
0.5;There were signs that someone had \Ntried to break open the safe,
0.5;but there was still a \Nbunch of cash inside it.
0.5;One time she came here really drunk \Nand loudly bragged about them.
0.5;but today's my birthday, \Nso I decided to wear them.
0.5;Well, an unpopular and \Ndisappointing hostess,
0.5;a worthless salaryman \Nwho only ever comes to drink
0.5;could never get their hands on \Nanything like this treasure.
0.5;there was another customer here \Naround the time of the incident...
0.5;Yumi-san and I flanked the culprit \Nwho was running down the street
0.5;in front of this shop and \Nchased him into here.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""Ramen to Die For: 2, Part Two!"""
0.5;Ran and I came to the Toto \NGymnasium to cheer on Hattori,
0.5;but did you just say something \Nabout winning the tournament?
0.5;Inscribing love and cases \Nwith deductive reasoning!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""Kendo Tournament of Love \Nand Mystery, Part Two!"""
0.5;That's the Yagyu Shinkage-ryu \Ncleaving stance.
0.5;That's the Tennen Rishin-ryu \Nhiraseigan stance.
0.5;Your blade is sharply inclined as you \Naim for your opponent's left eye.
0.5;but I can't let you mess up the \Ncrime scene anymore than you have.
0.5;Besides, it seems like there's something \Nromantic about this tournament.
0.5;And will Hattori-kun be able to win and \Nconfess his feelings to Kazuha-chan?
0.5;So, did you find a box \Ncutter in the bathroom?
0.5;Why did you bring your \Nsword bag to the bathroom?
0.5;so I was going to do some practice \Nswings after using the bathroom.
0.5;We took apart the two swords \Nthat were in the bag.
0.5;Since I'm a referee, I keep \Na spare bottle on hand.
0.5;At this tournament, we paint \Nover the name of the losers.
0.5;But you're up against Kaiho \NAcademy's Hattori next.
0.5;I-It's because I had it in \Nmy jacket's inside pocket.
0.5;Is it true that you're \Nforfeiting your final match?
0.5;The governor of Tokyo wants to \Nmake me an honorary citizen.
0.5;I thought only the elderly \Nwere given that title,
0.5;but it's not inconceivable since you've won \Ntwo consecutive national tournaments at your age.
0.5;Don't worry. I'll participate \Nin my semi-final match.
0.5;That means he's the strongest \Nkendo swordsman in Japan, right?
0.5;And since he won't fight in the finals \Neven if he wins his semi-final match,
0.5;But the month's almost over, \Nand you've hardly taken any.
0.5;Last month and the month before that, \Nyou took close to 200 pictures.
0.5;Are you the girl who likes cutters \Nthat Tsuneyuki said he met?
0.5;It's got nothing to do \Nwith the murder weapon!
0.5;Didn't this old man hear the \Nculprit mention box cutters?
0.5;"Now that I think about it, \NI think they said ""cutter."""
0.5;Inside the bag we found a wallet, \Na towel, a phone, a magazine,
0.5;an empty bag of stomach \Nmedicine, and the box it came in.
0.5;There are still traces of that \Nmedicine around his mouth.
0.5;His throat must have been \Ncut right after he took it.
0.5;Did you hear any strange \Nnoises inside the bathroom?
0.5;That was probably the sound of them throwing \Nthe armor out the bathroom window.
0.5;In any case, they cut the throat of a \Nranked swordsman with a single blow.
0.5;As another ranked swordsman, \Nthat makes you the most suspicious.
0.5;maybe he thought they were a student in \Nthe tournament and let his guard down?
0.5;There's blood on the thigh armor, \Nbut none on the gauntlets.
0.5;He was the referee for \Nmy quarter-final match.
0.5;He crashed into the guy I knocked back with \Nmy sword and was bleeding from his nose.
0.5;The hoarse-voiced man who told their \Nfriend to bring them another box cutter
0.5;Could you have them cancel the tournament \Nand bring the tournament organizer here?
0.5;In ten more minutes, we'll get \Nmore than our money's worth.
0.5;Since we can't find the murder \Nweapon, the killer is...
0.5;He senses his opponent like Zatoichi and \Nslashed his throat with a backhanded slice.
0.5;What I do know is the victim Nukitani-san \Nhad some kind of beverage in his bag,
0.5;was probably former Self-Defense \NForce official Sadamori Akane-san.
0.5;Because Nukitani-san took a powdered \Nmedicine just before he was killed,
0.5;Since the chocolate in \NSadamori-san's bag was melted,
0.5;she probably had a plastic bottle \Ncontaining a warm beverage inside it.
0.5;I-I told you, I was keeping the \Nchocolate in my inside pocket.
0.5;Wasn't only the edge melted because \Nyou poisoned a warm beverage
0.5;and were keeping it in your bag until \Nyou could give it to Nukitani-san?
0.5;So you could erase the evidence \Nof your attempt to poison him.
0.5;I thought he'd be in the bathroom \Nso I came to check on him,
0.5;I retrieved the plastic bottle so \NI wouldn't be suspected of murder.
0.5;It seems like the killer \Nwore the skirt backwards.
0.5;You didn't even know you're not supposed to \Nstrike victory poses during a kendo match.
0.5;when you bragged to your girlfriend about \Nstriking a victory pose after winning a match.
0.5;You resented him for the \Nembarrassment he caused you.
0.5;I thought I'd embarrass him, too, so I \Nfollowed and secretly photographed him.
0.5;I thought they might be having a \Ntryst and came to check it out,
0.5;I wanted to get out of here, \Nbut those kids showed up,
0.5;so I was deleting my photos \Nof him inside the bathroom.
0.5;That's why you had hardly \Nany photos this month?
0.5;and I practiced kendo for a little \Nwhile, so I know how to wear a skirt.
0.5;You're supposed to tie it under \Nthe front to hide the knot.
0.5;See? When you tie it correctly, you can \Nsee the blood on the front of the armor.
0.5;someone who knew how to wear the armor\Ndeliberately put on the skirt backwards
0.5;Among the three of you, the only \None who'd need to do that is
0.5;the man dressed as a referee who's \Nobviously a ranked swordsman,
0.5;But his match starts in \Nless than five minutes.
0.5;If I tell her where Hattori-kun \Nis, she's sure to come here.
0.5;But until the crime is solved, we \Ncan't afford to lose even a second.
0.5;That's why Nukitani-san's wife is on his \Nway here to bring him a fresh dress shirt.
0.5;you probably meant to spill ink on \NNukitani-san's shirt so he'd come here.
0.5;Y-You're saying I cut a man's \Nthroat with a bamboo sword?
0.5;If you sharpen a single piece of \Nbamboo and swing it horizontally,
0.5;the centrifugal force can \Ncut a person's throat.
0.5;I know someone who cut his \Nneck on a sword he parried.
0.5;was you dulling the pointed \Ntip against the wall.
0.5;Nukitani-san's blood must be stuck \Nto the inside of your sword bag.
0.5;even though I tried to \Nwash it in the bathroom.
0.5;Two years ago, Nukitani-san \Ndrove him to suicide.
0.5;Two years ago during this tournament's team \Nmatch finals, my son won a decisive bout,
0.5;but he accidentally struck a victory \Npose, and his victory was invalidated.
0.5;Their opponents made a comeback, \Nand my son's team was eliminated.
0.5;Unable to withstand the humiliation, \Nhe took his own life.
0.5;But according to the rules, \Nit couldn't be helped.
0.5;I thought Nukitani-san made \Nthe right call, too.
0.5;struck by Toto Senshin \NHigh School's second man
0.5;Not only did he not invalidate his victory, \Nbut he gave the student a pep talk!
0.5;He showed favoritism since \Nthey're both from Kansai!
0.5;That first-year second man \Nsaid he really wanted to win,
0.5;Apparently the referee told \Nhim not to cry during a match.
0.5;I'd like to meet my future husband \Nunder better circumstances.
0.5;This is because you took your \Nsweet time solving that mystery.
0.5;You idiot, you slowed me down with \Nyour nonsense about Zatoichi.
0.5;Were you sticking your \Nnose into some case again?
0.5;No one's escaped from my mini-patrol \Ncar on these streets before!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NMini-Patrol Car Police's Big Chase!"""
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shooting comet!

0.5;Say, would you like\Nto see Gomera close up?
0.5;That's just a suit.\NThey film it to make it look like

0.5;Director! Do something\Nabout these kids!

0.5;and they're like a family that's\Nworked with Gomera for ten years.

0.5;Ah, yes. I hear yesterday's\Nrush film is done.
0.5;No. Say, want to grab a bite?\NThere's still the matter to discuss.
0.5;He asked me to be the\Nleading role as a policewoman.
0.5;How can he blame people\Nand then ask something like that?!
0.5;What's to complain about?\NAt least you got some work.
0.5;We're left out in the cold.\NRight, Macchan?
0.5;No, he asked me\Nto be the villain...
0.5;Alright, Matsui-kun.\NThe kids are all yours.
0.5;Awesome!\NLook at all these monsters!
0.5;Sorry! I didn't think\Nyou'd be that surprised!
0.5;It's Gomera's hand.\NWe use it in close-up shots.
0.5;There's also a remote-controlled face.\NWanna see it?
0.5;Are Gomera movies really\Ngoing to end? They're so good...
0.5;It must be the food costs!\NGomera is big!
0.5;He was in here! And he\Nstabbed me with a knife!
0.5;Footprints?! He escaped\Nthrough that door!
0.5;Pardon my asking, but where\Nwere you at around 11:30 a.m.?
0.5;When you entered this storeroom,\Nthe killer was in here,
0.5;I gave him emergency treatment,\Nbut he needs to get to a hospital.
0.5;I wanted Producer Kamei to see\Nthe rush of the final Gomera movie.
0.5;Say, Tomomi-san. You saw the back\Nof the person in the suit, right?
0.5;Yes, but I'm not sure who it was.\NBut the way they ran...
0.5;But of course. That would be the\Ncase for everyone but Matsui-kun.
0.5;Agasa! The genius inventor\Nwho lives next door to Shinichi-kun!
0.5;You're always making\Noddball inventions!
0.5;So was the entire staff\Nreally in the screening room?
0.5;Wait, there was\Nanother who snuck out...
0.5;Why would I put paint in\Nthe middle of the set
0.5;when the taping was gonna\Nbe this afternoon?!
0.5;I noticed something on the\Nset when I saw the rush.
0.5;Adachi-san only snuck\Nout for four or five minutes.
0.5;and return to the screening room\Nafter running up the stairs.
0.5;Don't you remember?\NYou left it after the morning rehearsal.
0.5;Say, why didn't\NMatsui-san watch the rush?
0.5;Don't ask me. All he said was\Nthat he didn't wanna watch.
0.5;Don't say that. He's one of the\Nones who wanted to quit Gomera...
0.5;Yes. I hear he often\Nvented to the producer
0.5;about being sick of Gomera and\Nwanting to do normal roles.
0.5;It doesn't make sense.\NWhere did the killer disappear to?
0.5;We followed the footsteps\Naround the corner and up the stairs...
0.5;Hey, Conan-kun.\NLet's make a grave for Gomera.
0.5;And then through that\Ndoor to the roof...
0.5;Look at this!\NThere's no tail mark on the steps!
0.5;Because his tail\Nsticks up when he gets mad!
0.5;We're about to take\NMatsui-kun to the hospital.
0.5;It looks like he won't be able\Nto play Gomera with that leg.
0.5;Forget Gomera, he can't\Neven play a person...
0.5;Why did the killer attack\NMatsui-san in this storeroom?
0.5;Maybe the killer came to get the\Nknife but was spotted by Matsui-san?
0.5;Inspector. We're going to\Ntake Matsui-kun to the hospital.
0.5;The one responsible\Nis in this very room!
0.5;Hey! Just move your\Nlips to what I say!
0.5;Oh, come on! Let me\Nhave some glory too!
0.5;Alright, Agasa-san. If you know\Nwho did it, then please explain
0.5;I bet the killer was one\Nof them the whole time!
0.5;What?! I ran into the killer in the hall,\Nand even saw them escape!
0.5;Oh, uh, forget what I said!\NThe truth is--
0.5;Tomomi-san and the\Nchildren only saw the killer
0.5;There's no telling if the killer\Nwent up the stairs or not!
0.5;But there were footprints\Non the stairs.
0.5;The killer placed the footprints\Non the stairs in advance!
0.5;It wouldn't be strange for\Neveryone to overlook that stairway!
0.5;Gomera's legs were probably\Nthe only parts used to make them.
0.5;As proof of this, there is a tail mark\Nin the hall but not on the stairs.
0.5;The killer quickly removed the\Nsuit in front of the stairs,
0.5;went down in the opposite\Ndirection, entered a room,
0.5;lit the suit on fire, and\Ndropped it to the ground.
0.5;But would they be able to\Nmake the footprints in advance
0.5;without knowing the color the\Npaint on the set would be?
0.5;Yeah, I just happened to put that\Npaint there before the incident.
0.5;That paint was placed\Nthere by the killer...
0.5;Adachi-san probably only\Nfollowed Tomomi-san's lead,
0.5;She probably saw the killer when\Nshe bumped into him in the hallway.
0.5;The killer was among the four\Nwho weren't in the screening room
0.5;or who left the screening\Nroom at some point.
0.5;Adachi-san was only gone for\Nfour or five minutes. Not enough time.
0.5;"Tomomi-san saw the killer with\Nthe children; she's innocent too."
0.5;That leaves Director\NMikami and Matsui-san.
0.5;Get real! He couldn't escape\Nin that suit with his injury!
0.5;Assuming he really acquired\Nthat injury before the murder.
0.5;Yes. After the murder,\Nhe dropped the suit,
0.5;returned to the storeroom,\Nand stabbed himself with another knife
0.5;"This is a movie set;\Nit would be easy to come by."
0.5;But after they saw his injury,\Nthey followed Gomera out to the studio!
0.5;There's only one way to the\Nstudio from the storeroom.
0.5;Where exactly did Matsui-san\Npass ahead of them?
0.5;The studio is right next\Nto the hallway door.
0.5;He probably entered\Nonce the children left.
0.5;He then donned the suit and\Nmurdered Producer Kamei.
0.5;This trick would need witnesses\Nto follow the paint footprints.
0.5;I see. So he chose these children\Nwho couldn't follow as quickly.
0.5;"Children are bundles of curiosity;\Ntell them not to go and they'll go."
0.5;The suit was lit on fire to\Ndestroy sweat traces inside it.
0.5;What proof is there\Nthat Matsui-san did it?
0.5;The knife he used to stab himself\Nis in the storeroom prop box.
0.5;"It was probably the\Nonly place to hide it;"
0.5;he couldn't walk\Nafter stabbing his leg.
0.5;There's one more thing--\Nthe shirt he's wearing!
0.5;The killer ran off at full\Nspeed with the suit still on.
0.5;The shirt would naturally\Nbe soaked with sweat!
0.5;Of course not.\NBecause he changed it.
0.5;Remember when Ayumi-chan\Nspilled juice on your shirt?
0.5;But that's weird.\NThere's no stain here.
0.5;I thought you couldn't move\Nwith your stabbed leg?
0.5;Are you sure you're not\Nmistaken, little boy?
0.5;Maybe the juice was spilled\Non the floor instead?
0.5;He's right. I was really sweaty,\Nso I changed shirts.
0.5;Didn't he give you work\Nin his next movie?
0.5;"That had never entered my mind;\NGomera was all I thought about."
0.5;But weren't you the one who\Nwanted to quit Gomera the most?!
0.5;I thought it was strange how everyone\Nencouraged me with sad smiles.
0.5;I can't believe I learned of\Nhis lies only two weeks ago...
0.5;I hastily negotiated with him,\Nbut he said there was no turning back
0.5;as he had already announced\Nthis was the final Gomera movie.
0.5;But I regret nothing. Now Gomera\Nwon't have a final death scene.
0.5;I only feel bad about making\Nthe children see that.
0.5;Say, Tomomi-chan. Did you\Nreally see him in the suit from behind?
0.5;No, I didn't see anything.\NHe disappeared so quickly.
0.5;I could tell by his movements,\Nwithout having to see inside.
0.5;After all, he's been my partner\Nfor these past ten years.
0.5;Two months later, Gomera\Nmade it onto theater screens.
0.5;The last scene was connected\Nwith all the previous films
0.5;Gomera can now live\Nforever on the screen.
0.5;Crowds hold their breaths as they\Nwatch the powerful visuals and plot!
0.5;Yet, Gomera's war cry sounded\Nespecially forlorn to me
0.5;When Teraoka-san tried\Nto arrest Matsuyama-san,
0.5;we found three sets of\Nfingerprints on the gun.
0.5;If the gun's owner\Ndid as I think, then...
0.5;The first place winner will \Nreceive a 10 million yen prize.
0.5;Miss, thank you for coming \Nall the way out here.
0.5;I'm Hasegawa of the event \Nmanagement committee.
0.5;But the larger ones have climbed \Nover 10 thousand meters in the air.
0.5;I'm going to be riding one to \Nrecord the event on video.
0.5;They're as large as a seven story \Nbuilding and full of light air.
0.5;I'd been turning down his \Ninvitations until now.
0.5;If you miss this chance, you're \Nnot likely to get one again.
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;But something unexpected \Noccurs while riding one.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;I'm not actually very interested \Nin hot air balloons.
0.5;And he said he'd buy me a \Nnecklace with the prize money.
0.5;Because he flies hot air \Nballoons on his meager salary,
0.5;He's been the reigning \Nchampion two years in a row.
0.5;after the rest of us had \Ngone back to the hotel.
0.5;The blue balloon all the way \Nover there is Mizuguchi-san's.
0.5;I'll man the burner, so you \Ntake the camera, Conan-kun.
0.5;Isn't it dangerous for them \Nto be flying so close?
0.5;Participants score points not just for \Ndropping the marker on the target,
0.5;So everyone's trying to reach the \Nfinish line as quickly as possible.
0.5;Where is the man piloting the \Nhot air balloon that hit them?
0.5;He should be arriving at \Nthe finish line around now.
0.5;but I'd like to know the particular \Ncircumstances that caused the woman to fall.
0.5;I'm sorry to have to ask \Nduring such a difficult time,
0.5;and the hole opened on \Nthe side of the balloon,
0.5;But until the coroner examines \Nher, we can't be sure.
0.5;You should probably get your \Ninjuries looked at, too.
0.5;Come to think of it, Mizuguchi-san \Nhad a cut on his face.
0.5;I don't know what happened \Nto the guys in back.
0.5;So you acknowledge you crashed \Ninto Mizuguchi-san's balloon?
0.5;Everyone was trying to get to the \Nfinish line as quickly as possible.
0.5;This kind of thing happens \Nall the time in races.
0.5;It may have been an accident, \Nbut a person is dead.
0.5;He said I was way too \Ninexperienced to beat him.
0.5;You tried to poke a hole \Nin Mizuguchi-san's balloon
0.5;while I was working on \Nmy balloon yesterday!
0.5;our balloons would've just \Nbumped into each other!
0.5;Mizuguchi-san opened the deflation \Nport and reduced his altitude.
0.5;"Ran-neechan, you said ""huh"" \Nwhile we were flying, right?"
0.5;But when I looked later, \Nthere were two people there.
0.5;Arisa-san must have been \Ncrouching in the basket.
0.5;we've decided to revoke your victory \Nfor obstructing another competitor.
0.5;No matter how many times we discuss \Nit, the result will be the same.
0.5;You heard him. Okuda-san, will \Nyou come to the station now?
0.5;Hasegawa-san said last night \Nyou were the last one here
0.5;That's when you damaged the \Nbasket on Okuda-san's balloon
0.5;Then you provoked Okuda-san \Nbefore the race
0.5;If he hadn't, you probably meant \Nto run into him yourself.
0.5;When Ran looked inside \Nyour balloon in the air,
0.5;But the next time she \Nlooked, she saw two people.
0.5;When I examined your \Nballoon on the riverbank,
0.5;But the bag containing another \Nimportant item was missing.
0.5;And there was blood on \Nthe inside of the basket.
0.5;Forensics did say the blood \Nbelonged to the victim.
0.5;I was doing my best to protect \Nher in the unsteady basket!
0.5;After opening the deflation port \Nand lowering your altitude,
0.5;And if it wasn't an accident, \Nthen it was Okuda's fault!
0.5;After reducing your altitude and \Nhiding your basket from view,
0.5;...threw the unconscious Arisa-san's \Nbody from the basket.
0.5;there's some plastic stuck to the \Nballoon shaped like a doll's hands.
0.5;It was found about 300 meters \Nfrom the starting point.
0.5;The stocks I bought with money \Nborrowed from my clients crashed.
0.5;If I didn't return it soon, they were \Ngoing to audit me next month.
0.5;So you were blinded by your \Nwife's life insurance money.
0.5;You should think about what you've \Ndone from inside a prison cell,
0.5;Why don't your detective skills \Napply to anything else?
0.5;If it's genetic, then you're \Nthe one who should be sleeping.
0.5;Both of them are just sleeping, \Nnot solving mysteries.

0.5;Carried along by the increased \Nwater level from yesterday's rain,
0.5;the bomb most likely stopped \Nat the grate under here.
0.5;he always meant to blow up \Nthe cash transport vehicle.
0.5;He made you throw the \Nbomb in the manhole
0.5;They asked us to arrest the bomber \NHirukawa Takuji since they spotted him.
0.5;It's as though you were never \Ninjured in the first place.
0.5;By the way, I heard you're \Ngoing independent soon.
0.5;Will you be funding yourself using the cash \NHirukawa stole from the transport truck?
0.5;Hirukawa's hideout exploded \Nand burned down.
0.5;even when including the bills \Nthought to have burned,
0.5;the remaining bills they found \Nin the wreckage didn't add up
0.5;I was wondering where the \Nremaining money went.
0.5;And apparently the location of the \Nhideout came from an anonymous tip.
0.5;It sounded like they were \Nusing a voice changer.
0.5;That makes it difficult to \Ndetermine whose voice it was.
0.5;The problem isn't the \Nvoice, but what was said.
0.5;Hirukawa's name hadn't been released \Nto the press at that time.
0.5;The only ones who knew it was him \Nwere the police, us, and you.
0.5;when his face was shown \Nduring his last bombings.
0.5;Tomonaga-san, you were \Nstanding behind Hirukawa
0.5;from the remotes only worked \Nat a range of about thirty meters.
0.5;So only someone at the scene with \Nus could have sped up the timer
0.5;Later, you asked the inspector \Nif you could accompany us,
0.5;and sent me messages in \Nresponse to my actions.
0.5;You suggested to Hirukawa that \Nhe attack the transport truck
0.5;while making it look like he \Nwas out to avenge his brother.
0.5;Once I go independent, why \Nnot write mysteries for me?
0.5;Hardcore mystery fans will \Nsurely criticize you for that.
0.5;A confession from Hirukawa \Nwould change the story.
0.5;At least, that's what \Nthey said on the news...
0.5;I didn't understand then why a \Nman who'd forgotten the answer
0.5;to the riddle suddenly started talking \Nabout the illustrations in the picture book,
0.5;We passed the police cars on their way and \Nused the rear entrance to his hideout.
0.5;Without realizing that, as soon as \Nthe police surrounded the hideout,
0.5;I'm sure Hirukawa will have \Nsome interesting things
0.5;When you said the author left \Nthat proof to his brother.
0.5;It doesn't make sense for a \Nproof to be misaligned, right?
0.5;Hirukawa naturally would \Nhave demanded the original,
0.5;Which means you would've looked \Nthrough it during this case,
0.5;Even if he was family, I didn't \Nwant to turn it over to a criminal.
0.5;And tearing out the pages \Nthat contained the clues...
0.5;Even though it was my plan, I \Ncouldn't bring myself to do it.
0.5;but you used that wonderful \Npicture book to commit a crime.
0.5;whether according to the \Neditor's prediction or not,
0.5;Oh, yeah? I'd like to say \Na line as cool as that.

0.5;She gives us all her CDs\Nin person, so we don't get extras...
0.5;Yeah, my name is Mori Kogoro.\NI'm a detective.
0.5;N-No! I just recognized that name!\NYou're so famous that I...
0.5;I'll go get her.\NYou can relax in the living room.
0.5;Come on, now.\NIt'll take an hour to get there!
0.5;Yoko-chan, Anzai Asuka,\NTwo-Mix, Hoshino Terumi...
0.5;Amazing! They even have\NLex, and they disbanded!
0.5;It's also amazing you\Nknow so much about this stuff...
0.5;Her sister must've had\Nit rough, putting up with this.
0.5;See? There are two of everything,\Neven photo books and CDs!
0.5;But why didn't Masayo-san\Ntake them when she moved?
0.5;There's probably so much\Nthat she couldn't take it all at once.
0.5;I think it's been\Ntaped shut from the inside!
0.5;The door and the\Nwindow were both taped shut!
0.5;And on the floor are two open\Nbottles of different bath detergents!
0.5;But if that's the case,\NI don't get how it was done...
0.5;How could someone leave\Nthis completely sealed space?!
0.5;The deceased is\NAoshima Mina-san, age 24.
0.5;The cause of death was blood\Nloss stemming from the severance
0.5;of her ulnar artery caused\Nby cuts to her left wrist.
0.5;And it was you, her sister,\Nwho found her, Masayo-san?
0.5;And, at the scene just\Nby coincidence yet again...
0.5;The truth is, Masayo-san had asked\Nme to pick Mina-san up in my car.
0.5;We went into the bathroom\Nwhen we noticed something was strange.
0.5;By which you mean the\Ntape on this window and door?
0.5;Yes... there was tape all over the inside,\Nso the room was sealed off.
0.5;There's no doubt\Nit was a suicide, though.
0.5;It's probably because mixing\Nchlorine and acid-based detergents
0.5;She sealed the room\Nso the gas wouldn't leak out.
0.5;But Mori-kun.\NThese are both chlorine-based.
0.5;Besides, chlorine gas isn't\Nbad enough to seal the room...
0.5;Inspector... the late\NMina-san wasn't a pro like us.
0.5;She wouldn't have known\Nthe strength of chlorine gas.
0.5;I also believe she was in a very\Nconfused state before killing herself!
0.5;To commit suicide, she prepared\Ntwo types of bathroom detergent
0.5;But when she\Ntried to produce the gas,
0.5;she realized she had\Nbought the wrong detergents.
0.5;With no other choice, she cut\Nher wrist with a razor in the room
0.5;and left the cuts in the\Nwarm water to kill herself.
0.5;Mina-san purchased two\Nbath detergents and tape
0.5;It's proof she decided to\Ncommit suicide and prepared hastily.
0.5;Go confirm this at\Nthe convenience store.
0.5;The roll of tape was\Nfound at the bottom of the bath,
0.5;so this situation is plausible\Nif Mina-san was acting hastily...
0.5;This lady's wrist\Nis cut in rushed zig-zags!
0.5;Most hesitant cuts made by\Npeople committing suicide are parallel.
0.5;It just shows how\Nconfused she was at the time.
0.5;See? Look at this blood!\NIt suddenly stops at the edge!
0.5;That means she cleaned up\Nthe blood after it went flying, right?
0.5;You're so stupid!\NNobody committing suicide would do that!
0.5;When the blood sprayed,\Nthere was something here, or...
0.5;Or someone was next to\Nher when she cut her wrist.
0.5;Inspector, if I didn't\Nknow better, I'd say...
0.5;The tape was at the\Nbottom of the bathtub, right?
0.5;Ah! If the tape was\Non the edge of the tub
0.5;It appears only Mina-san's\Nfingerprints are on the tape.
0.5;Prints from both index fingers\Nand thumbs show up clearly.
0.5;Of course it was. This bathroom\Nwas completely sealed off!
0.5;You said I could have a ticket\Nto Okino Yoko-chan's concert tonight!
0.5;Come on! We can at least\Ncatch the finale if we go now!
0.5;I'll go get it. I think my sister\Nput them all in the living room.
0.5;These boxes have bend marks.\NDid you put them together before?
0.5;Y-Yes! I had so many things to\Ntake that I decided to get them later!
0.5;Oh! So that's why you\Nhad your sister help you then?
0.5;After all, the edges\Nof that table are all sticky!
0.5;Having someone line up pieces\Nof tape makes packing a cinch, huh?
0.5;L-Little boy!\NYour sister is calling you!
0.5;There's no point\Nwiping away the tape marks.
0.5;The examiner touched them\Nand photographed them after I told him.
0.5;Oh, Conan-kun!\NYou know not to scamper around!

0.5;So the murder was predicted\Nand you still couldn't stop it?
0.5;It wasn't a prediction. Someone\Nwas asking him for help.
0.5;That's true if they were talking\Nabout this murder.
0.5;I'd like to confirm your alibis once again\Nand examine your personal belongings.
0.5;The killer must've thrown it\Naway or hidden it by now.
0.5;Well, since you're not Holmes,\Nit can't be helped.
0.5;I was in the back of the station.\NSince I was alone, I have no alibi.
0.5;I was alone on the station platform,\Ntoo. I don't have an alibi.
0.5;Why didn't I notice? They're\Nthe one who wrote it.
0.5;They tore it off because their\Nown name was written on it.
0.5;Nothing she said made any\Nsense. She's been exposed.
0.5;Today is flammable garbage\Nday. You can't throw this out.
0.5;I-I was just testing it out in the\Nmountains before I came here.
0.5;into illegally manufacturing altered\Nfirearms, but it wasn't going well.
0.5;I thought I had no choice but to\Ndie out here, but I couldn't do it.
0.5;Since there's no way there'd be a taxi out\Nhere, why did the victim go outside?
0.5;That's it. That explains why they reacted\Nto the old woman that way, too.
0.5;Masako-san realized something\Nwhen she looked at this poster,
0.5;and she was attacked during\Nthe blackout immediately after.
0.5;That must be it. She realized\Nwho the killer's real target is.

0.5;Hey, isn't there something \Nwrong with his shoes?
0.5;He couldn't answer her \Nquestion, so he ran away.
0.5;Were you at the park during \Nlow tide this morning?
0.5;By the way, had your husband's \Nbehavior changed at all recently?
0.5;We'll most likely investigate \Nboth possibilities.

0.5;You hadn't switched it \Nout in a while, had you?

0.5;Is there anyone who goes water \Nskiing in the middle of the night?
0.5;does that mean it was in \Nthe park the whole time?
0.5;Then Ryuji-san's body washed out \Nthrough the flood gate on the tide
0.5;However, due to a malfunction \Nwith the control panel,
0.5;Ryuji-san's body washed back \Nin through the flood gate,
0.5;But why would the murderer \Nbother with all of that?
0.5;didn't want the body \Nto be found in the park?
0.5;but I found a photo of \NAoi-san uploaded to an SNS.
0.5;It was taken around the same time \Nas the victim's time of death.
0.5;You know it's forbidden to \Nchum the waters here
0.5;I doubt you'd try anything in an \Narea that's so closely watched.
0.5;If it was a suicide, he should've \Nreported it to the police.
0.5;He had served as the park's \Ngroundskeeper for years.
0.5;Tanba-san decided to transport \Nthe body out of the park.
0.5;and it would've taken too long for \NTanba-san to move it on his own.
0.5;Not only have we stopped \Nrespecting our elders,
0.5;If you think abandoning a \Ndead body isn't a crime,

0.5;Well, I'm leaving now. \NGood luck with your job.
0.5;That night, there was a fire at \Nthe Kadowaki family residence,
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!
0.5;A complicated family situation \Nand a former student and suspect.

0.5;I told the cops who came \Nyesterday about that customer.
0.5;He sat in that corner seat for the \Nthree-hour all you can eat and drink.
0.5;We should check the security \Ncameras next, right?
0.5;Look. He came back out \Nin less than ten minutes.
0.5;He checked inside the shop, \Nbut no one was there.
0.5;He came back about an hour and a half \Nlater, but there was still no one there.
0.5;Come to think of it, we got an even \Nstranger customer the other day.
0.5;This is when he came after nine. \NYou can see his face, right?
0.5;This is when he came back \Nan hour and a half later.
0.5;Isn't it strange for him to be satisfied \Nif he got the day of his meet-up wrong?
0.5;Now we just need evidence \Nthat Takase-san did it.
0.5;If we tell him we've disproved \Nhis alibi, he'll give it up.
0.5;The fact that you fled when \Nyou saw me proves it.
0.5;Yes. I'd like to turn over \NKadowaki Eiji-san's murderer.
0.5;Could you come to the water \Ntaxi pier in Asakusa? Yes.
0.5;The alibi you've been relying \Non to prove your innocence
0.5;is easily constructed if you have, \Nfor example, a friend to help you.
0.5;You used a person with a build \Nsimilar to yours as a stand-in.
0.5;You swapped places with \Nyour friend in the bathroom,
0.5;Then you returned to the restaurant and \Nswapped places with your friend again,
0.5;Unfortunately, this is the \Nend of the line for you.
0.5;It would be best if you came \Nclean and turned yourself in.
0.5;You were just saying how I could've \Nkilled him, too, weren't you?
0.5;until the great detective \Nremembers what proof he has.
0.5;But now that we've started this, \Nwe have to do whatever it takes to get him.
0.5;Who do you think killed \NKadowaki Eiji-san, and why?
0.5;But since the good brother \Nwas around, Kadowaki-sensei—
0.5;If he wanted to get back \Nat Kadowaki Yasuko-san,
0.5;he would've killed Yuichi-san \Ninstead of Eiji-san.
0.5;Abandoned at home, \Nyelled at by teachers at school.
0.5;Someday you'll understand \Nwhat a blessing it is.
0.5;Why after running into her for \Nthe first time in twenty years?
0.5;She was there when I went to the \Northopedist for my chronic back pain.
0.5;Th-That's right. I accidentally missed \Na step on the stairs last night
0.5;She couldn't tell her former student \Nthat her son was abusing her.
0.5;You probably thought you were returning \Nthe favor when you killed Kadowaki Eiji-san.
0.5;Kadowaki Yasuko-san was the only \None who paid you any attention.
0.5;you couldn't believe that careful \Nwoman could have done that.
0.5;And when you began investigating the \NKadowaki family, you heard a certain rumor.
0.5;Yasuko-san was being abused \Nby her younger son Eiji-san daily,
0.5;and her older son Yuichi-san \Nwas trying to protect her.
0.5;Fortunately, Yuichi-san had protected \NYasuko-san from Eiji-san's violence until now.
0.5;However, there was no guarantee Yuichi-san \Nwould always be there in the future.
0.5;When you think of it that way, \Nit explains what you said.
0.5;You thought you'd saved her \Nfrom her son's violence,
0.5;If you're so determined to pin this \Non me, bring me the evidence!
0.5;You ran into Kadowaki-sensei \Nat the hospital last Saturday.
0.5;In other words, Kadowaki Yasuko-san \Nwas injured the day before, on Friday night.
0.5;Last Friday, he got drunk \Nand argued with a bar employee.
0.5;But since Yasuko-san was injured \Nregardless, there's only one explanation.

0.5;And without Eiji-san to put the \Nbrakes on the situation,
0.5;Isn't he the one who did it?! \NYour former student?!
0.5;Isn't he the one who did it?! \NYour former student?!
0.5;When asked about the unnatural way \Nthe fire started during his deposition,
0.5;He killed his mother and started \Nthe fire to hide the evidence.
0.5;Later, Takase Rintaro-san confessed \Nto Kadowaki Eiji-san's murder.
0.5;He was taken away by the police \Nofficers waiting at Asakusa.

0.5;his wife was found murdered in a manner \Nsimilar to the one in his performance.
0.5;However, Tengan-san was \Nquickly found innocent.
0.5;Believing his apprentice Togawa\NHaruomi killed her to bury his affair,
0.5;the police requested a \Nwarrant for his arrest.
0.5;Would someone trying to put the blame \Non Tengan-san ask the old man for help?
0.5;With the same feelings we've \Nalways held still in our hearts,
0.5;"The truth behind the case lies in the\Nquestion, ""Who is the star?"""
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Didn't you use this to make Tengan-san \Nbelieve he had a split personality disorder?
0.5;Do you really have no\Nidea why these glasses
0.5;stained with the victim's blood \Nwere hidden in your bag?
0.5;to admit to your crime before\Nthe warrant we requested arrives.
0.5;There's something I want\Nyou to check for me.
0.5;He has something else to investigate, \Nso he told me to come check this out.
0.5;This photo was taken in the living room \Nwhere the murder took place, right?
0.5;When the suspect Togawa-san found\Nthe body of Tengan-san's wife,
0.5;Yeah. He came to pick up \NTengan-san for work as usual,
0.5;and when nobody answered the doorbell, \Nhe entered using his spare key.
0.5;and called the police and \NMori-san to ask for help.
0.5;He could've snuck in while \NTengan-san was sleeping
0.5;while under the effects of the \Nsleeping pills he always used.
0.5;It's also possible that the victim, who he \Nwas having an affair with, invited him in.
0.5;Though we're not yet sure if \Nhe stayed at the crime scene
0.5;after committing the crime \Nor returned in the morning.
0.5;The trophy that was used as \Nthe weapon was here, right?
0.5;The dust is shaped differently \Nfrom the weapon.
0.5;And originally the trophy \Nwas sitting back there.
0.5;The photo in the entryway \Nshows the same thing.
0.5;Detective Takagi, there's \Nsomething I want you to confirm.
0.5;Tengan-san received that trophy the first \Ntime he finally won the national contest.
0.5;He always displayed it in the front \Nsince it was valuable to him.
0.5;But it was moved to the back, and the trophy\Nused as the weapon was placed in the front.
0.5;I didn't want him to hear me say \Nthat he may have killed his wife.
0.5;I don't know. I was panicked, \Nso I don't know where I put it.
0.5;I think I left it in the living \Nroom and left to use the phone.
0.5;Oh, forensics said it was \Nprobably fibers from a glove.
0.5;so his fingerprints wouldn't get on \Nthe trophy covered in Tengan-san's.
0.5;No. We didn't find anything \Nin his house or in the area.
0.5;without even cleaning them, \Nwhile throwing away just the gloves?
0.5;Were you able to confirm \NMori-san asked you to check?
0.5;But I still don't know \Nthe most important part.
0.5;I apologize for the trouble and concern I \Ncaused to all concerned parties and my fans.
0.5;You're a victim of infidelity and \Nbereaved husband of a murder victim.
0.5;Because you're definitely sane, and you \Ndefinitely planned to kill your wife.
0.5;I knew you set up speakers and \Na recorder somewhere in here.
0.5;I'm busy practicing for \Nmy encore performance.
0.5;You'll need to properly \Nexplain yourself, Mori-kun.
0.5;Though we did put a hold on that \Narrest warrant like you said.
0.5;After all, only proper \Nexplanations hold up in court.
0.5;Allow me to describe the truth behind \Nthis case that I have discovered.
0.5;He made me believe I had a split \Npersonality disorder and framed me.
0.5;Your clever plan to initially \Ncast suspicion on yourself,
0.5;have me clear your name, \Nand frame Togawa-san.
0.5;Didn't you change your plans and put \Non that performance to mislead me?
0.5;Yes. Tengan-san is the one who set up \NTogawa-san's stolen recorder and speakers
0.5;and told him he'd check his progress the next\Nday so he'd practice alone and have no alibi.
0.5;Now let me explain how \Nhe committed the crime.
0.5;The trophy he used to kill his wife is\Nnormally at the back of the sideboard.
0.5;Before the crime was committed, it was \Nswapped with a trophy of great value to Tengan-san.
0.5;If Togawa-san were the murderer, \Nit would be a meaningless act.
0.5;It shouldn't have mattered which \Ntrophy he used as a weapon.
0.5;Tengan-san, only your fingerprints \Nwere on the weapon.
0.5;Of course, that's because you \Ngrabbed the weapon barehanded,
0.5;Furthermore, you even confessed \Nthat you killed your wife.
0.5;What need would he have \Nhad to do anything else?
0.5;you put on gloves and put the victim's blood on \NTogawa-san's glasses, which you stole beforehand.
0.5;Then while Togawa-san was calling the \Npolice and me for help in the entryway,
0.5;you donned the gloves again and placed the \Nbloodied glasses at the bottom of his bag.
0.5;That's probably when the fibers from your \Nglove got caught on the frames of his glasses.
0.5;Then you pretended to \Nhave a split personality,
0.5;and claimed the doll ordered you to do it, \Ninitially casting suspicion on yourself.
0.5;The man inside me ordered\Nme to kill my wife.
0.5;Hey, you're saying that after \NI backed up your alibi?
0.5;Then you had me discover \Nthe recorder and speakers.
0.5;and had the police discover\Nthe glasses to seal the deal.
0.5;The gloves Tengan-san wore \Nwhile placing the bloodied glasses
0.5;Considering the timing, you could only \Nhave hidden them in the living room,
0.5;No. Not even the police found it during \Ntheir inspection of the crime scene.
0.5;You know where he hid \Nthem, don't you, Partner?
0.5;I'll never tell them that I've \Ngot them. My lips are sealed.
0.5;Tengan-san disposed of the actual \Ngloves once he was acquitted.
0.5;While you left your doll here to meet \Nwith your staff in another room,
0.5;Furthermore, another person's\Nsweat was collected from the fibers,
0.5;we can get a warrant for a sample of your \Nsaliva or hair and wait for the test results.
0.5;I couldn't believe my wife was\Ncheating on me with my apprentice,
0.5;even though I finally won\Nthe national contest.
0.5;Because you hid the gloves inside him, \Nhis expression was different from usual.
0.5;You're a victim of infidelity and \Nbereaved husband of a murder victim.
0.5;No, you and the doll were telling \Nthe truth from the start.
0.5;You used your confession to \Ncommit the perfect crime.
0.5;I really did nearly arrest \Nthe wrong man this time.
0.5;I had no idea you were capable \Nof ventriloquism, though.
0.5;Like you said, we were still in possession \Nof the speakers and recorder.
0.5;A sickle. And speaking of \Nanimals that have sickles...
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Kamaitachi Inn, Part One!"""
0.5;The next episode features \NHattori-kun and Kazuha-chan.
0.5;Could you get serious for a moment,\NInspector Megure?
0.5;How long do you intend to\Ndetain all of my guests?
0.5;The victim was a guest\Ninvited to your party--
0.5;Are you suggesting that\Nthe one responsible is in this room?
0.5;The killer entered from the next\Nwindow over on the 3rd floor
0.5;There were no footprints\Nbelow the window,
0.5;which points to the fact\Nthat this was an inside job.
0.5;Nonsense! It's almost\N10 meters to the next window!
0.5;Jumping from one to\Nthe other is impossible!
0.5;If the killer used the edge of the\Nroof to get across to the next window,
0.5;there would be less than 2\Nmeters left to the veranda
0.5;There's no way they could have\Njumped the 2 meters to the roof edge,
0.5;The killer brought some rope\Nwhen leaving the next room over,
0.5;affixed it to the veranda,\Nand then later used it to return.
0.5;But then how was the rope removed\Nfrom the veranda afterward?
0.5;A stick was tied to one end of the\Nrope and attached to the veranda.
0.5;You should find marks from when\Nthe rope was affixed to it!
0.5;But what was Mr. Yamazaki\Ndoing inside a locked room?
0.5;Most likely, the killer told him\Nto wait there with the door locked
0.5;because he had something\Nimportant and secret to tell him.
0.5;Just who was it who broke in and\Nkilled Mr. Yamazaki, my best friend?!
0.5;There is only one person who knows\Nenough of this house's layout
0.5;and who could walk throughout it\Nwithout raising any suspicion.
0.5;You must be joking!\NMy leg hasn't even healed yet!

0.5;I'm not mad at all that my dad\Ncan't get any work because of you.
0.5;It's not my fault your dad doesn't get\Nmuch work, he's just not good at it.
0.5;Just what I'd expect from\Nthe head of the karate club...
0.5;If you hadn't quit the soccer club,\Nyou would've been a big hero here...
0.5;I only did soccer to acquire the physical\Nprowess that all detectives need!

0.5;And his keen powers of observation\Nand deduction are unparalleled!
0.5;On top of that, his violin skills\Nare equal to those of a professional!
0.5;Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes\Nis the world's greatest detective!
0.5;If you like him so much, why don't\Nyou become a writer like your dad?
0.5;I don't want to write about\Ndetectives, I want to BE one!

0.5;It's fine that you're always flirting\Nwith girls, but at least choose a favorite!
0.5;You haven't forgotten your\Npromise for tomorrow, right?

0.5;But the Mystery Coaster should\Nbe okay for you two, right?
0.5;Ayumi-chan, we only have enough\Nleft for the train back home.
0.5;Hey, look, Shinichi! There's room\Non the Mystery Coaster! Let's go!
0.5;The coolest thing about Holmes is\Nwhen he first met his assistant Watson,
0.5;he could tell he went to Afghanistan as\Na military doctor just by shaking his hand!
0.5;Only girls who train on the horizontal\Nbar ever get this many of them.
0.5;But you can get blisters\Ndoing tennis too...
0.5;Actually, I saw earlier when\Nthe wind blew her skirt up!
0.5;Only those with experience\Non the horizontal bar

0.5;How long are you going\Nto keep holding her hand?
0.5;A friend of yours? In that case,\Nwhy don't we switch places in line?
0.5;Plus it'd be impolite to disturb\NAiko and Kishida-kun!
0.5;So do you see? Conan Doyle must\Nhave wanted to be like Holmes!
0.5;Cut it out with Holmes and Doyle,\Nyou big mystery geek!
0.5;I looked so forward to coming\Nhere with you, Shinichi...
0.5;Why can't you see the way\NI feel about you?
0.5;Got you! What're\Nyou so nervous about?
0.5;You won't make a good detective\Nif you're tricked so easily!
0.5;We don't have time to loiter around\Nbecause of an ordinary accident!
0.5;And the culprit was one of the 7\Nother people on the roller coaster!
0.5;That's Shinichi Kudo, the famous\Nhigh school student detective?!
0.5;He's the Savior of the\NJapanese police department!
0.5;So, temporarily taking you\Nand Ran-kun out of the picture,
0.5;Passengers A and B in the first row\Nwere both friends of the victim.
0.5;C, who was both friend and girlfriend\Nto the victim, was in the third row.
0.5;And D and E were the men in\Nblack who sat behind the victim.
0.5;But everyone had their\Nsafety guards on,
0.5;so only the woman sitting next to\Nhim could have committed the murder!
0.5;We don't have time for your\Nlittle detective games!
0.5;He's glaring like he's killed lots of\Npeople before without a second thought.
0.5;Inspector! There's a knife\Nin this woman's purse!
0.5;No way! I've never seen\Nthat before in my life!
0.5;Aiko! And I thought you and\NKishida-kun were on good terms...
0.5;It's obvious the girl did it!\NWe'll be leaving now.
0.5;Alright! Take her into custody\Nas the prime suspect!
0.5;Severing a person's head with\Nsuch a knife would be impossible.
0.5;You put the knife in Aiko's purse\Nin advance to put the blame on her.
0.5;But she was sitting\Nin the very front row!
0.5;No, it's entirely possible if\Nshe utilized the coaster's speed
0.5;I'm the murderer and\NInspector Megure is the victim.
0.5;First, before pulling\Nthe safety guard down,
0.5;I put a purse-like\Nobject behind my back.
0.5;With the extra space,\Nit's easy to slip out.
0.5;Next, I take out a pre-prepared\Nrope with a hook at the end.
0.5;Then I put my legs around the guard,\Nstretch back, and place the rope loop
0.5;All while inside a pitch-black\Ntunnel, of course.
0.5;After this, the coaster's speed\Nand power will take the head right off.
0.5;As a gymnast, doing all of this while\Non the coaster is entirely plausible!
0.5;This is crazy!\NWhat proof do you have?
0.5;The pearl necklace you were wearing\Nbefore you got on the ride.
0.5;You knew beforehand that\Nthe victim was going to die.
0.5;Which is why you silently\Nwept before doing him in.
0.5;The trails of tears that go\Nhorizontally across your face...
0.5;The only way your tears could\Nhave flowed horizontally
0.5;was if you were crying\Nwhile on the coaster.
0.5;Hitomi, you were going\Nout with Kishida-kun?
0.5;That's right! Long before\NI met you two in college!
0.5;...where we had our very first date,\Nusing the necklace he gave me!
0.5;I'm used to crime scenes now.\NYou know, torn up bodies and stuff...
0.5;It's best to forget about\Nit as soon as possible.
0.5;These sorta things happen\Nall the time, you know!
0.5;Huh? It's one of the men in black\Nfrom the roller coaster...
0.5;I'm not sure why, but I could\Njust tell somehow...
0.5;Sorry for the wait,\NCompany Director.
0.5;You're late! I've been\Nwaiting for two hours!
0.5;I came alone,\Njust as I promised!
0.5;I know. I rode the roller coaster\Nand checked from above.
0.5;Don't get ahead of yourself!\NThe money comes first!
0.5;Here! I take it you have\Nno objections?!
0.5;Whoa! There's at least\N100 million in there!
0.5;The incriminating film that shows\Nyour company smuggling weapons?

0.5;No. The place is still\Ncrawlin' with cops.

0.5;When the countdown reaches zero, use your \Ndetective skills to produce an answer!
0.5;The police are called to \Na wealthy man's study!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;The large man is Kawai Shinzo-san, \Nthe resident of this home.
0.5;but the cause of death is blood loss \Nfrom the ice pick in his chest.
0.5;The smaller man on the floor \Nis Shibata Kensuke-san.
0.5;but he most likely struck his \Nhead on the armrest of the sofa.
0.5;Also, the blood on Shibata-san's \Nsweater matched Kawai-san's.
0.5;The blood must've gotten on \Nhim when he stabbed him.
0.5;The bodies were discovered \Nabout an hour ago.
0.5;Also, they're the president and former \Nemployee of a real estate company.
0.5;She was sleeping in the second floor \Nbedroom when the incident occurred.
0.5;She said she'd been looking \Nafter her mother all morning,
0.5;Ma'am, I'm sorry to question \Nyou when your husband's dead.
0.5;Had your husband arranged \Nto meet Shibata-san here?
0.5;Shibata-san was using the \Nmoney he embezzled
0.5;Conan-kun, you can't just \Nenter the crime scene.
0.5;You went to care for your \Nmother with an injury?
0.5;If I'd noticed something was wrong, this \Nwouldn't have happened to my husband.
0.5;By the way, you weren't answering the \Ndoor even though we kept calling.
0.5;Shibata didn't embezzle the \Nmoney to pay for hospital bills.
0.5;The sweater he was wearing was \Nfrom a pretty high-end brand.
0.5;If he was strapped for cash, \Nhe couldn't have bought that.
0.5;You don't know much about \Nfashion, Mr. Detective.
0.5;According to the employees \Nof Kawai Real Estate,
0.5;Kawai-san said he didn't \Nintend to rehire Shibata-san.
0.5;It was just an excuse to \Nmake him return the money.
0.5;So he failed to fulfill his promise \Nafter the money was returned.
0.5;Looks like she wasn't lying \Nabout the intercom not working.
0.5;Genta-kun, make sure you \Naim for the goal this time.
0.5;it seems like one man was stabbed \Nand immediately pushed the other.
0.5;Like you said, I think that's \Nprobably what happened.
0.5;No. I think I hurt my throat \Nwhen I screamed earlier.
0.5;Based on the circumstances, it \Ncould only have been Genta...
0.5;The professor has something \Nhe hasn't told the police.
0.5;Yeah. I don't think this case \Nis as simple as we think.
0.5;So we should assume Shibata-san \Nwas pushed forcefully
0.5;and fell, and not that he \Nslipped and hit his head.
0.5;The room's windows and the \Nfront door were locked.
0.5;It seems unlikely that they \Nwere killed by an outsider.
0.5;Yes. She's telling the truth about her \Nfoot injury and caring for her mother.
0.5;Oh, I probably hit the door \Ntoo hard when we came here.
0.5;Inspector, we found this button \Nin a potted plant on the shelf.
0.5;His button must have flown \Noff during their tussle.
0.5;The sweater he was wearing was \Nfrom a pretty high-end brand.
0.5;about this case that was \Nhidden behind the veil.
0.5;we'd like to ask you more questions \Nabout their relationship and the case.
0.5;I thought I'd give you an \Naccurate version of the events.
0.5;What? But we just investigated \Nthe case and concluded that—
0.5;Don't you realize there's no way \NShibata-san could have killed Kawai-san?
0.5;It should be obvious when you consider \Nthe difference in their height.
0.5;tried to stab the much taller \NKawai-san in the chest,
0.5;Wouldn't the blood end \Nup on his pinkie finger?
0.5;he saw that Shibata-san's third button was \Nmissing when he looked under his sweater.
0.5;could have ended up inside \Nthe pot on the shelf.
0.5;Yuko-san, you were in this room \Nuntil we arrived, weren't you?
0.5;Then how did you know it \Nwas Genta-kun who screamed?
0.5;The second floor doesn't have \Nwindows facing the yard.
0.5;You couldn't have known which child \Nscreamed just from the sound.
0.5;That's because you were watching Genta-kun \Nfrom this room when he screamed.
0.5;When you put it all together, the only \Nperson who could have killed Shinzo-san
0.5;was the person who was inside \Nthe house at the time.
0.5;What if Kawai-san had been stabbed \Nin the stomach by Shibata-san
0.5;A woman with a foot injury could \Nstab a badly injured victim.
0.5;That doesn't explain how \NShibata-san fell and died.
0.5;I don't know what happened \Nbetween you two then,
0.5;but you decided to kill \Nhim, grabbed the ice pick,
0.5;and finished off your \Ngravely wounded husband.
0.5;because I overhead Genta \Ntelling the police about it!
0.5;Are you saying I picked it \Nup and put it in the pot?
0.5;But you panicked and didn't \Nnotice it had fallen off.
0.5;If the button came off \Nwhile they were fighting,
0.5;Yuko-san, the sweater he was wearing \Nbelongs to you, doesn't it?
0.5;Not knowing what to do \Nwith your bloody clothes,
0.5;you realized Shibata-san was \Nabout the same height as you.
0.5;To make it look like he'd done \Nit, you put your clothes on him.
0.5;Fortunately, it was a color \Nthat a man might wear.
0.5;It may have been missed if they were \Nassumed to have killed each other,
0.5;but a quick investigation should reveal \Nif you were wearing the sweater.
0.5;Kawai Yuko-san, can we ask \Nyou again what happened?
0.5;Shibata thought he'd be \Nable to return to work
0.5;Shibata and his family got \Nwhat was coming to them.
0.5;This happened because you \Ntook sympathy on that trash!
0.5;Both of you are wasting money \Non helping useless old people!
0.5;I'd put up with my arrogant \Nhusband for so long.
0.5;We only got to play a little soccer \Nto help the professor lose weight.
0.5;Next time let's start in the \Nmorning, for the professor's sake.

0.5;I get it! The killer strangled\Nhim from the front!
0.5;You'd expect him to put up quite a\Nfight if he was being strangled,
0.5;In other words, the killer\Nwas someone strong enough
0.5;that the victim's struggling\Nposed no problem at all.
0.5;But it looks like he\Ndidn't put up a fight at all.
0.5;He'd still struggle, no matter\Nhow strong the killer was, right?
0.5;Yes. Like scratching at the killer\Nor trying to undo the necktie.
0.5;Interesting. There aren't\Nany marks on his nails.
0.5;It's possible to black out instantly\Nif strangled with enough force.
0.5;The killer must've been someone\Nas strong as a pro wrestler!
0.5;Yeah. Check at once\Nto see if any such people
0.5;In any case, we can't move the\Nbody until medical examiners arrive.
0.5;I'd like to speak with\Nwhomever's in charge.
0.5;I'm Megure of\NPolice Investigative Unit ♪1.
0.5;I hear the owner was killed.\NSo, what do you plan to do?
0.5;Have the party cancelled\Nimmediately, of course.
0.5;We've invited all these\Nhigh-profile guests.
0.5;Canceling this event\Nwould tarnish my career!
0.5;Listen, you!\NThis is a premeditated murder!
0.5;But she wouldn't\Nhave the strength for this.
0.5;I found several guests\Nmatching your description!
0.5;Imamura Kotaro,\Nthe football player, and--
0.5;Anaconda Katagiri-sama once\Ngot into a fight with the owner
0.5;We can only hope the incident\Nis that straightforward...
0.5;Thank you all for coming\Ntoday to Okano Rika-sensei's
0.5;Anaconda Katagiri-san.\NCould we have a word with you?
0.5;This guy... No, Anaconda-san's been\Nwith his friends the whole time.
0.5;The inspector's in trouble!\NHe says he needs your help!
0.5;But how did they get him\Nto breathe the chloroform?
0.5;Something's not right about\Nthis flower... What could it be?
0.5;Wait a minute!\NWhen he was in the dressing room,
0.5;His dying was the greatest\Ncommemoration gift ever!
0.5;He was nothing but a stepping\Nstone on my way to fame!
0.5;A stepping stone\Nis just a stepping stone!
0.5;Midori-san. You just need to\Nshut up and handle my management.
0.5;Who do you have to thank\Nthat you can make a living?!
0.5;Chloroform, just as I thought.\NAnd this other bottle has...
0.5;Is the killer still going\Nafter someone else?!
0.5;The frozen chloroform slowly\Nmelted in the room's temperature
0.5;She's amazing! She makes\Nflower buds open right up!
0.5;So the closed flower\Nhad a secret hidden inside it!
0.5;The frozen chloroform\Nwas placed inside,
0.5;because all the party guests\Nwere wearing flowers on their chests.
0.5;And then, when the flower\Nwarmed up in the room's temperature,
0.5;it started to re-open,\Nand the chloroform also vaporized.
0.5;upon which he was\Nslowly strangled to death.
0.5;His dying was the greatest\Ncommemoration gift ever!
0.5;If Okano Rika is the killer,\Nwho will she go after next?!
0.5;Thank you for your patience,\Nladies and gentlemen!
0.5;Here is Okano Rika's\NCongratulatory One-Man Show!
0.5;At this temperature,\Nso will the killer's ice!
0.5;All the guests were given flowers at\Nthe reception desk beforehand!
0.5;In which case, the flower\Nwould've opened long ago!
0.5;Was I over-analyzing things?!\NWas the owner the only target?
0.5;No, then there'd be no\Nreason to have cyanide ready!
0.5;The killer must be planning\Nto murder someone with it!
0.5;That's not it! Where is it?!\NWhere could it be?!
0.5;She's amazing! She makes\Nflower buds open right up!
0.5;Yes! That's it! Don't tell\Nme she plans to kill her?!
0.5;You damn kid!\NWhat were you thinking?!
0.5;I'm sorry! I swung it\Nand it suddenly shot out!
0.5;Have you found a\Nclue to solving the case?!
0.5;It was actually I who\Nhad him interrupt the show.
0.5;Why would you do that?!\NYou'll pay for this!
0.5;Inspector. Please seal\Nup all the arranged flowers.
0.5;Double and triple seal them\Nso that no air can leak out.
0.5;Hidden inside the flowers is\Nthe secret to the owner's murder...
0.5;We've bagged them all up,\NMori-kun! Now talk to us!
0.5;was the very theme of Rika-san's\Navant-garde flower-arranging...
0.5;What nonsense is this?!\NWhy would I have to kill the owner?!
0.5;Because you were the\Nnext to die after the owner!
0.5;The person who put\Nthe flower on the owner
0.5;Yes. It was your manager...\NOzaki Midori-san!
0.5;After all, only Midori-san could've\Nrigged the flowers on the stage.
0.5;she would've died from\Nthe flowers she set, too!
0.5;Yes. She intended to enact\Nrevenge and die with Rika-san...
0.5;She made it popular,\Nmore than anything.
0.5;Rika-san probably didn't come\Nup with the flower-opening idea.
0.5;That's right. I had to\Nmake Shiraki and Rika pay.
0.5;My sister Haruka started this\Navant-garde flower-arranging,
0.5;in an attempt to become the\Ntop avant-garde flower arranger!
0.5;In the art world, it's natural for\Nthe skilled to kick down the unskilled.
0.5;But Okano Rika knew\Nshe could never be the best
0.5;So she used dirty tactics and\NShiraki's support to pressure her
0.5;into being unable to\Ntake credit for what Rika stole!
0.5;On top of that, it was\Nmy sister who came up with
0.5;She only used them\Nto gain fame and money.
0.5;after I changed my name\Nand became her manager!
0.5;Through this incident, Okano Rika's\Nplagiarism was made public,
0.5;meaning she'll probably never\Nstep onto a center stage ever again.
0.5;...I wound up being punished by\Nthe old guy, who slept through it all.
0.5;There's still a good chance\Nthe criminal group is nearby.
0.5;You've been asked to\Nkill that Akabane guy, right?

0.5;Yeah! He attacked\NRan in the forest!
0.5;Weren't the three of you\Nin the forest too?
0.5;We didn't see him either,\Nright, Chikako?
0.5;You went and disappeared\Nsomewhere!
0.5;Are you sure you weren't\Nafraid of the lightning?
0.5;I guess it's almost over\Nbetween them...
0.5;I was on the roof\Nthe entire time,
0.5;but I don't remember\Nseeing anyone like that...
0.5;but he was wearing\Na black cape and a hood.
0.5;Yes! That's the person\Nwho attacked me!
0.5;I saw the same guy\Nwhen I got here!
0.5;Same here! But I figured\Nhe lived nearby...
0.5;There are only two or three lodges\Non the other side of the bridge,
0.5;Maybe the phones are down\Nbecause of that lightning strike?
0.5;It was him! That\Nbandaged man cut the line!
0.5;Probably fell on its own.\NIt was pretty old.
0.5;What the hell?!\NIt's been chopped up!
0.5;It was that guy!\NHe did this too!
0.5;He attacked the girl in\Nthe forest, cut the phone line,

0.5;The girl that had something\Nhappen two years ago--
0.5;She killed herself.\NTwo years ago.
0.5;She was a member\Nof our filmmaking group, too!
0.5;Then she suddenly\Nhanged herself in her room,
0.5;and everyone stopped\Nmeeting after that.
0.5;So let's not talk about\Nthat anymore, alright?
0.5;There's someone\Nby the downstairs window!
0.5;Damn! It's too dark\Nto see where they went!
0.5;For now, we covered\Nthe body with my jacket
0.5;Why would someone\Nkill Chikako-san?!
0.5;If only I hadn't\Nplanned this reunion,
0.5;That's not true, Ayako!\NIt's not your fault!
0.5;That crazed murderer\Nwho ran off with Chikako
0.5;We'll be fine if we\Nlock the place down.
0.5;Chikako was careless enough\Nto stroll around outside.
0.5;Anyway, let's forget about this\Nand get some shut-eye.
0.5;Let's make sure everything\Nis locked and get some rest.
0.5;We'll climb down the mountain\Nand get the police tomorrow.
0.5;If she went out the front door,\Nher slippers should be here.
0.5;What if the guy\Nsnuck into the lodge
0.5;Remember? When Conan-kun\Nand the others ran after him,
0.5;you, me, and Ayako-san split up\Nand checked all the locks!
0.5;Chikako-san's room\Nwasn't in shambles,
0.5;and the window was\Nlocked from the inside.
0.5;Her leg had been\Nchopped off, though.
0.5;Hey, does this lodge\Nhave any other exits?
0.5;Here we go! These are definitely\NChikako-san's slippers!
0.5;We didn't leave\Nany spare ones out!
0.5;So that means Chikako-san\Nwent out this way...
0.5;But why did she go out this way\Nand not the front door?
0.5;It's almost like she was trying\Nto sneak out unseen...
0.5;Well, we found her slippers,\Nso let's go to bed now.
0.5;Stop worrying,\Neverything'll be all right!
0.5;If the bandaged man\Nshows up again,
0.5;Yeah, right! When he attacked you in the\Nforest you were too scared to do anything!
0.5;Say, why do you think\Nhe attacked you, anyway?
0.5;I don't know.\NMaybe it didn't matter who.
0.5;Does anybody have\Na grudge against you?
0.5;Like anyone whose face\Nyou injured with karate?
0.5;But there's something odd\Nabout that bandaged man.
0.5;If he took Chikako-san,\Nwho left out the back door,

0.5;"""The Cooking Classroom\NMurder Case (Part 1)."""
0.5;A teacher named Uemori Michi\Nruns it out of her home.
0.5;I've heard of her!\NShe teaches French cooking, right?
0.5;Yeah! Sonoko asked if I'd\Nlike to go with her this Sunday.
0.5;I've always wanted to study\NFrench cuisine, so I told her I'd go!
0.5;Something suddenly came up, \Nso Sonoko couldn't come.
0.5;Something suddenly came up, \Nso Sonoko couldn't come.
0.5;Listen, Ran. I didn't come along\Nbecause I want to eat French food.
0.5;Over there is a student,\Nthe teacher's old high school classmate,
0.5;This is Mori Ran-san,\Nwho's filling in for Sonoko-san tonight!
0.5;Oh, Kaoru-san.\NWhat's with that eye patch?
0.5;No, apparently something\Nurgent came up.
0.5;It's only natural that\Nshe'd want to skip class...
0.5;Don't worry. You won't\Nbe the only one she yells at.
0.5;Ah, so that's why ol' Sonoko ran\Noff and used Ran as a replacement.
0.5;Incidentally, has Uemori-sensei\Ngone somewhere?
0.5;Her French recipe book\Nbecame a best-seller,
0.5;and there's a party\Ntomorrow in celebration of that.
0.5;One-third of the recipes in\Nthat book are hers... Yuko-san's.
0.5;Stop it, Kazue-san.\NThat doesn't matter.
0.5;Oh? Why not?!\NYour own recipes have been stolen!
0.5;while working so hard these\Npast five years as Michi's assistant!
0.5;Yet, you don't complain at all.\NYou must be crazy!
0.5;This is between our teacher\Nand Yuko-san! It's none of our business!
0.5;Michi has been giving you\Nfinancial assistance all this time.
0.5;Oh? I'd love to hear\Nhow they're not related.
0.5;Oh, man.\NThings are getting weird in here...
0.5;She always has her pulse checked\Nlike that after going somewhere.
0.5;but he grew up as an only child\Nand has a terrible mother complex.
0.5;Kaoru-san has it tough,\Nbeing Michi's daughter-in-law.
0.5;I heard the teacher's\Nhusband died of an illness.
0.5;I'm sorry, but you'll\Nhave to smoke outside.
0.5;Through that door and to the left.\NThere's one for men and women.
0.5;Yuko-san. I know\Nwhat I said earlier, but...
0.5;Today, we'll be making mushroom\Nterrine and duck in orange sauce.
0.5;Even if you are good,\Nthat's not very professional...
0.5;That sounds great!\NDuck, huh?! I just love duck!
0.5;I'll make some myself, so watch\Nme and follow my example.
0.5;You're so inept.\NYou haven't changed one bit.
0.5;What's this? Now you can't\Nseparate the white and the yolk.
0.5;I'm sorry. I can only see with\Nmy right eye, so it's hard to tell...
0.5;Yuko-san. I don't see the\NGruyere cheese!
0.5;Yeah. It's no wonder\NSonoko is avoiding her.
0.5;Yuko-san! Go to the electrical\Nroom and check the breaker!
0.5;That's strange.\NWhy is the switch off?
0.5;Mister! Someone set up\Na trick here to cut the power!
0.5;They put the ring around the switch,\Nand the weight on the ice!
0.5;...the ring would be pulled\Ndown and turn the switch off.
0.5;Let's go back to the classroom!\NSomething might've happened!
0.5;It's the teacher! She says her\Nchest hurts and it's hard to breathe!
0.5;Hey! Who opened\Nthe front sliding door?!
0.5;I felt a sharp pain in my\Nback while the lights were out...
0.5;Ran! Call an ambulance right away!\NAnd Inspector Megure, too!
0.5;She needs to get\Nto a hospital right away!
0.5;What gives you the\Nright to give us orders?!
0.5;Pardon my late introduction.\NI am Mori Kogoro, the detective.
0.5;Could you explain\Nwhat's happened here?
0.5;I believe someone stabbed\NUemori Michi-san in the back
0.5;with something with a sharp tip,\Nlike an ice pick or an awl.
0.5;An ice pick or something\Nsimilar would leave such a mark.
0.5;And, even though ice pick\Nstab marks don't look like much,
0.5;they can often pierce lungs\Nand other internal organs.
0.5;So the reason her chest hurt and\Nshe couldn't breathe was because...
0.5;Ran and the others heard the\Nsliding door shortly after the blackout,
0.5;so it's highly likely the\Nperpetrator entered from outside.
0.5;I must ask that none\Nof you leave the room.
0.5;We'll check for\Nfingerprints on the door first.
0.5;Who was the last person\Nto touch the door handle?
0.5;and when Uemori-sensei came,\Nhe opened the door from the inside!
0.5;I believe the attacker snuck into\Nthe electrical room via the back door
0.5;hid in the shrubbery in the yard,\Nand waited for the power to go out.
0.5;She had something shiny on,\Nor something that made her stand out.
0.5;Then the attacker must've\Nused infrared goggles or something.
0.5;Are you serious? Infrared goggles\Naren't that easy to get ahold of.
0.5;Incidentally, the old guy says\Nit was likely an outside attacker,
0.5;but it's strange that there\Nare no shoeprints left on the floor.
0.5;Did the person actually take\Noff their shoes before coming in?
0.5;Right. Only Nishitani-san's\Nfingerprints were on both door handles.
0.5;The attacker was\Nprobably wearing gloves,
0.5;and Nishitani-san touched the\Ndoor last, so that's to be expected.
0.5;But, oddly enough, the outside\Nhandle fingerprints are fully there.
0.5;Only the inside fingerprints\Nare somewhat gone.
0.5;If the attacker opened\Nthe door from the outside,
0.5;Nishitani-san's fingerprints on\Nthe outside handle should be gone!
0.5;The fact the inside\Nfingerprints have rubbed off...
0.5;...means the attacker opened\Nthe door from the inside!
0.5;Someone in the classroom opened\Nit from the inside to deceive us!
0.5;They most likely used a\Nhandkerchief or something to do it!
0.5;In other words,\None of you four is responsible!
0.5;Uemori-san has just passed\Naway due to respiratory failure
0.5;Nishitani-kun. I hear she was\Ngoing to cut off your financial support.
0.5;Yuko-san. You held a grudge\Nbecause she stole your recipes.
0.5;The pitcher who threw a home \Nrun at the start of the game.
0.5;will catch the thief who \Nbroke into your home.
0.5;The jewelry shop by the station \Nwas robbed the other day.
0.5;In that case, Junko-san, perhaps I \Nshould stay at your house tonight.
0.5;So I was hoping you could catch \Nthe thief as soon as possible.
0.5;It sounded like it came from \Nthe apartment parking lot.
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills \Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;While discussing theft prevention, a \Nneighbor experiences a strange fall.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;The deceased is Kitagami \NNaotsugu-san, thirty-two years old.
0.5;He was an office worker who lived in \Nroom 704 of this apartment building.
0.5;Due to the numerous scratches \Non the front of the body,
0.5;There's a weird smell mixed \Nin with the smell of alcohol.
0.5;By the way, who's the woman \Nwho was with you?
0.5;There's nothing suspicious \Nabout our relationship.
0.5;She's a victim of the burglaries that have \Nbeen occurring in this neighborhood lately.
0.5;When I came to this apartment \Nto discuss the matter,
0.5;Coincidentally, she lives in the room \Nnext door to the victim Kitagami-san.
0.5;It looks like he just forgot \Nto lock his front door.
0.5;Inspector, the victim seems \Nto have been drinking.
0.5;But why did the victim \Ncome out on the balcony?
0.5;He was probably drunk \Nand trying to cool down.
0.5;Split up and question the \Nneighbors just in case.
0.5;Kitagami-san was found \Ndead in the parking lot.
0.5;In that case, could you \Nlet us see your balcony?
0.5;Apparently, this necklace \Nbelongs to Miyoshi-san.
0.5;was the resident of this room who \Ngot drunk and fell from his balcony,
0.5;I didn't find any particularly \Nuseful information.
0.5;I'll have Section Three \Ncontact you immediately
0.5;I can't believe the man who \Nfell happened to be the thief.
0.5;While looking at myself \Nreflected on the wall,
0.5;Anyway, this wall sure \Nis glossy like a mirror.
0.5;Since it's quick-drying and glossy, \Nit's often used in elevators.
0.5;The detective badge that was \Nin my pocket is missing.
0.5;Do you have any idea where \Nyou might've dropped it?
0.5;but please leave once you \Nfind what you're looking for.
0.5;Mori-kun, what are you doing \Nin this man's apartment?
0.5;But everyone forgets to \Nlock their door sometimes.
0.5;There was something strange \Nabout the body, too.
0.5;Detective Takagi, how do you \Ndress when you drink at home?
0.5;Kitagami-san's body was dressed \Nin a suit and necktie,
0.5;even though he was supposedly \Ndrinking at home.
0.5;had been left out for a while and \NKitagami-san had been out drinking.
0.5;Doesn't that mean it was poured \Nshortly before we entered the room?
0.5;But what's stranger is the fact that \Nyou're lounging around in this room.
0.5;Detective Takagi, look at the \Nbalcony of this apartment.
0.5;That's when Kitagami-san's belt \Nbuckle scratched the railing.
0.5;Naturally, Kitagami-san's belt \Nbuckle was scratched, too.
0.5;Then you raised his legs and slowly \Nlowered him from the balcony.
0.5;That's when the entire front \Nof his body was scratched.
0.5;You barged into my apartment, and \Nnow you're accusing me of murder?
0.5;He could've scraped against my \Nbalcony while he was falling.
0.5;And there were signs of lock picking \Non the keyhole of this apartment.
0.5;So he ran into the victim as he was \Nburgling his apartment and killed him?
0.5;But, Mori-san, why didn't Sawada-san \Nreport it to the police or run?
0.5;but you don't look like \Nyou could afford to buy
0.5;So Kitagami found the jewels when \Nhe broke into the apartment,
0.5;In addition to the jewels, \Nthere's tear gas inside the bag.

0.5;Detective Chiba, illuminate \Nmy hands and Conan's clothes

0.5;He barged into my apartment \Nand killed himself!
0.5;Since he had his key on him, \NI went to his apartment...
0.5;in a childish attempt \Nto hide what you'd done!
0.5;How long are you going to \Nkeep sleeping, Mori-kun?
0.5;Your reasoning was impressive, \Nbut now you've disgraced yourself.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Just Like \Na 17 Year Old Crime Scene, Part One!"""
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 17 \N""The Missing Fiancée"""
0.5;If we want to make sure she'll never be \Nfound, we'd have to bury her in the mountains.
0.5;No matter how many times I \Ncall her, she won't answer.
0.5;Well, yes. Eventually I'm \Ngoing to take over everything.
0.5;So you're the son of a distinguished \Nfamily whose future is laid out for him.
0.5;I hate to say it, but while it \Nwas love at first sight for me...
0.5;This engagement meant single office \Nworker Kawaguchi Motoko-san
0.5;I can't imagine her giving \Nthat all up and running away!
0.5;Motoko must have gotten involved \Nin some kind of incident!
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Three nights ago, I got a \Ncall from Kawaguchi-san.
0.5;She couldn't tell me where \Nshe was moving to, though.
0.5;In any case, she said she'd have \Nmovers come pick up all her stuff.
0.5;The day after, like she said over\Nthe phone, the movers came.
0.5;The mover gave me this key and said \Nwhoever hired him asked him to return it,
0.5;Even though she hadn't mentioned \Nanything about it during the day.
0.5;Yes. We ran into each other \Nin the city in the evening.
0.5;Kawaguchi Motoko-san has been \Nmissing since that night.
0.5;But when I saw her, she \Nseemed like her usual self.
0.5;She smiled and said she was on her \Nway to see Terakado Shigemi-san.
0.5;She's an older woman who lives alone, \Nand she sometimes goes to check on her.
0.5;Wait, does that mean Motoko went missing \Nafter she visited Terakado-san?
0.5;In any case, we'll try \Nmeeting with Terakado-san.
0.5;Yeah. And how long are you \Ngoing to keep following me?
0.5;I have some questions about \NKawaguchi Motoko-san.
0.5;She's always looked after me \Nsince then. I'm grateful to her.
0.5;I believe a young woman may have visited \Nyour neighbor from time to time.
0.5;I think she came in the \Nevening three days ago.
0.5;That Kawaguchi girl was causing \Ntrouble for Terakado-san.
0.5;Wasn't she helping her? \NShe said she was grateful.
0.5;At first, yes. But she began asking \Nfor money every time she visited.
0.5;Oh, that's right. I was \Ntaking out the garbage.
0.5;When you consider she tried to \Nhide the fact that she visited,
0.5;But transporting a body would \Nbe too hard for an old person.
0.5;That's Terakado-san's friend \Nwho sometimes visits.
0.5;Terakado Shigemi murdered \NKawaguchi Motoko-san
0.5;Then she pretended to be Kawaguchi \NMotoko-san and made a of couple calls.
0.5;That way no one would find it suspicious \Neven if she suddenly disappeared.
0.5;Her friend, the mover, \Nhelped her get rid of the body.
0.5;They probably stuffed the body in a futon \Nbag and carried it out of the apartment.
0.5;Then he pretended Kawaguchi \NMotoko-san hired him
0.5;to transport her things to make\Nit look like she had moved.
0.5;The moment you began your investigation, \Nher friend Suda Kumi-san appeared.
0.5;we met her rather well-informed neighbor,\Nwho kept giving us more information.
0.5;that Terakado Shigemi-san murdered\NKawaguchi Motoko-san,
0.5;But if you don't find the body, \Nyou can't have us arrested.
0.5;The four of you worked together \Nto make it look like she had.
0.5;We wanted to save Motoko-san \Nfrom her fiancé Toriumi-san.
0.5;But she couldn't handle the way he believed \Neverything would go as he wanted,
0.5;so Motoko asked to break \Noff their engagement.
0.5;I already introduced you to my friends \Nand acquaintances as my fiancée.
0.5;What will people think of me if\Nwe break off our engagement?
0.5;I refuse to participate in \Nsomething so embarrassing.
0.5;There was nothing Motoko-san \Ncould do anymore.
0.5;he'd use his money and power \Nto find her and bring her back.
0.5;So you worked together to come \Nup with a way to save Motoko-san.
0.5;I enlisted Ryuji-kun, who helped me \Nalong with Motoko-san one year ago.
0.5;We came up with the idea \Nof faking her murder.
0.5;And Motoko-san would begin a \Nnew life in some town far away.
0.5;Toriumi-san hired a detective \Nto find his missing fiancée.
0.5;Based on the statements of Kumi-san \Nand my neighbor Mitsue-san,
0.5;We don't care if Toriumi-san \Nreports us to the police.
0.5;She's hiding and waiting until \Nwe tell her our plan succeeded.
0.5;I understand how you feel, but what \Nam I supposed to tell my client?
0.5;That Kawaguchi Motoko-san was so \Ndesperate to cut ties with him
0.5;So I should tell him to break \Noff the engagement like a man?
0.5;I'll bring Toriumi Haruki here \Nso you can tell him the truth.
0.5;Then I promise I'll convince him to\Ngive up on Kawaguchi Motoko-san!
0.5;I'll call you once I figure \Nout where I'm hiding.
0.5;You haven't been able to get \Nin touch with her since then?
0.5;Someone was looking for something \Nthere two mornings ago.
0.5;Realizing Kawaguchi Motoko-san \Nwas planning something,
0.5;When you asked her what she was \Nplanning, she confessed everything.
0.5;She hoped you would \Nunderstand her desperation.
0.5;I never saw her! In the first \Nplace, I never followed her!
0.5;Your secretary confirmed that you \Nreceived these special-order cuff links
0.5;Two days ago, you were looking for\Nthem in the street early in the morning.
0.5;Which means you must have lost them \Nthe day before, or three nights ago.
0.5;Yours and Kawaguchi\NMotoko-san's fingerprints
0.5;are on the cuff links, \Nmeaning the two of you met.
0.5;They probably went flying when you \Ntried to drag Motoko-san into your car.
0.5;that you could use her plan \Nagainst her and murdered her.
0.5;Not even you would want to \Nmarry a woman who hates you.
0.5;But you had to keep up appearances, so \Nyou couldn't break off your engagement.
0.5;However, if your fiancée were killed, \Nyou wouldn't have to marry her.
0.5;Then I should've just \Ngone along with her plan.
0.5;No, you needed Motoko-san to \Nactually disappear from this world.
0.5;Someone may eventually have realized that \Nyour allegedly dead fiancée was actually alive.
0.5;After killing her with your own hands and \Nhiding the body, you hired me to find her.
0.5;Knowing I'd find Terakado-san \Nand her friends before long,
0.5;you waited for my call so you \Ncould report them to the police
0.5;and tell them you saw them hiding something \Nthat looked like a body and where to find it.
0.5;Once it was found according \Nto your description,
0.5;Terakado-san and her friends \Nwould be accused of the crime.
0.5;I did see Motoko, but we parted \Nways immediately, and I went home!
0.5;You exited at the Kofu interchange \Nand got on some mountain road,

0.5;Yeah, I'm in the\N4th-floor meeting room.
0.5;I'm checking the show out\Non the monitor.
0.5;Oh, and tell Matsuo-kun\Nsomething for me.
0.5;Tell him to come here\Nright after the show.
0.5;I used to be a police detective,\Nbut I'm not very good with guns...
0.5;Aren't guns your specialty,\NMatsuo-san?
0.5;Didn't you train overseas\Nand become a pro?
0.5;His character is funny\Nand he draws in steady numbers,

0.5;What's gotten into him?\NGo and see if he's there.
0.5;Eh? Why the meeting room\Nand not somewhere else?
0.5;The elevator's in use!\NLet's take the stairs!
0.5;The victim is this TV station's producer,\NMr. Suwa Michihiko, 37 years old.
0.5;The bullet pierced his head,\Nshattered the glass,
0.5;Inspector. There are other\Nbullet holes in the wall.
0.5;Inspector.\NI found shells in the corner.
0.5;That matches the number\Nof bullet holes.
0.5;And there's only one way\Nin and out of here.
0.5;The killer most likely\Nbarged in through the entrance
0.5;then shot wildly\Nand killed Suwa-san.
0.5;The killer tossed the gun\Nby his feet and escaped.
0.5;Has anybody seen someone\Nwho might be the killer?
0.5;Suwa-san drove\Neveryone out, so...
0.5;He said he had something important\Nto discuss after the show.
0.5;See! It looks like\Nhe was on his cell phone!
0.5;If so, then the other person\Nmight've heard something!
0.5;Okay! Figure out who he knows\Nand who he talked to!
0.5;Matsuo-san! What are your\Nthoughts on this?!
0.5;Could one of your fans\Nhave done this--
0.5;Yes, there was talk\Nof me being replaced.
0.5;But Suwa-san said he wanted me\Nto remain the host!
0.5;I will carry on Suwa-san's\Nwishes and continue hosting!
0.5;And I'll put this case on the show\Nand work my hardest to find the killer!
0.5;I won't stop until I find the\Nmonster that killed Suwa-san!
0.5;Yes. He picked up\Nwhen I called at 8:15,
0.5;So the murder took place\Nwithin that 40-minute period...
0.5;I asked him to find out\Nwhere Suwa-san was.
0.5;That reminds me, I hear you're\Nwell-trained with handguns...
0.5;I was hosting a live\NTV show from 8:00 to 9:00!
0.5;No, there was a 4-minute\Nvideo clip during the show.
0.5;Yes, I did leave the studio,\Nbut I went to the restroom!
0.5;Are you sure you didn't take a gun\Nand come into this room instead?!
0.5;Come on, now!\NIf you think I'm lying,
0.5;then try running from the studio\Nto this 4th-floor room and back!
0.5;Six minutes,\Nforty-seven seconds.
0.5;Can't you run\Nany faster than that?
0.5;We checked the security tapes but\Nwe didn't see Matsuo-san on them.
0.5;It would seem my\Ninnocence is clear now.
0.5;But how did he go to that room\Nand back in four minutes?
0.5;Where did you go?\NI was looking all over for you!
0.5;I was with the old man\Nthe whole time.
0.5;TV stations are built all complex-like\Nto prevent guerrilla takeovers.
0.5;A TV station person\Ntold me earlier!
0.5;But there has to be\Na shortcut hidden within it!
0.5;A secret path that takes you from\Nthe studio to that room and back
0.5;Only the stairs\Nfrom the 9th to the 7th floor
0.5;can be used to avoid\Nthe security cameras.
0.5;It would be possible to make it\Nhere and back in two minutes...
0.5;This window's right above that\Nroom!
0.5;No. If the killer\Nentered through the window,
0.5;the victim would have been\Ndriven to the door.
0.5;But the victim was driven\Nto the window.
0.5;Have you still not found\Nwho the victim was talking to?!
0.5;What?! It's been an hour\Nsince the incident!
0.5;Which means there's only\None possibility I can think of...
0.5;The person on the\Nphone was the killer!
0.5;The fact that this is here\Nmeans there's no doubt about it!
0.5;Clear proof that\NMatsuo-san was the killer!
0.5;Hey, now.\NIs Yoko-chan really in here?
0.5;Could I borrow that\Npaint gun and TV camera?
0.5;"The live broadcast of ""Mori Kogoro's\NReal-Life Detective Show!"""
0.5;I wouldn't want\Nthe criminal to leave
0.5;when the detective show's\Njust about to begin...
0.5;And that criminal is you,\NMatsuo-san!
0.5;Detective Mori asked\Nfor an AV feed from in here...
0.5;The culprit fired wildly in this 4th-floor\Nroom and killed the victim!
0.5;But Matsuo-san was hosting\Na live television show
0.5;in the 9th-floor studio\Nat the time of the murder!
0.5;But it would become possible\Nif he used the window
0.5;in this 7th-floor storeroom\Nthat's three floors above you.
0.5;Yes. It is possible to go from the studio\Nand back in under two minutes!
0.5;Camera! You're too close\Nto the Inspector!
0.5;I wonder if they'll get mad that we're\Nusing equipment without permission...
0.5;It's just an internal broadcast.\NThey'll never find out.
0.5;Broadcast this to the\Nwhole country right now!
0.5;Allow me to shed\Nsome light on the subject!
0.5;Matsuo-san most likely stuck\Nhimself out this window,
0.5;aimed down three floors\Nto the room in question--
0.5;The victim was shot\Nin the head here.
0.5;And the window\Nwas practically closed,
0.5;so unless he flew,\Nit wouldn't be possible to--
0.5;How did the killer get the victim\Nto look upwards from the window?
0.5;The caller probably said he was\Ngoing to jump off and commit suicide!
0.5;Troubled by this, the victim\Nquickly opened the window.
0.5;Oh? Does that\Nexpression mean I'm right?
0.5;Then what about the bullet\Nholes and shells in the room?
0.5;Matsuo-san prepared them\Nin advance, of course.
0.5;If you want proof\Nhe shot from above,
0.5;there's a bullet hole on the\Nground beneath the window.
0.5;You left the studio\Njust as the video clip began
0.5;and came to this\N7th-floor storage room.
0.5;After using said trick to kill Suwa-san\Nin the room three floors below,
0.5;you returned to the studio\Nbefore the video clip ended.
0.5;Do you have definitive proof\Nthat I used this trick of yours?
0.5;In your haste,\Nyou most likely forgot to turn it off.
0.5;Yes. Your cell\Nphone is the proof!
0.5;I assume you know that the redial\Nbutton works if you don't turn it off!
0.5;I thought you said you didn't\Nknow Suwa-san's number?
0.5;I put this phone on my desk\Nbefore the show!
0.5;I used that phone\Nduring the show.
0.5;Assuming you hadn't called\Nanybody else afterwards,
0.5;it would've connected\Nwith the bar I called.
0.5;Who else but yourself\Ncould possibly use the phone
0.5;you put in your jacket\Nafter I used it?!
0.5;I guess having you as today's\Nguest was a mistake, Mori-san.
0.5;Matsuo-san!\NSo you really did kill him?!
0.5;I didn't want to give up my role as the\Nhost of the show we thought up together.
0.5;Suwa-san said\Nhe thought it up himself...
0.5;He got credit for coming up\Nwith the show's idea,
0.5;But then he suddenly\Ntold me to step down!
0.5;Looking back,\Nbefore the program began,
0.5;I had the most fun when we were\Nplanning it out together.
0.5;It's like they say--\Ngetting ready for the festival
0.5;is more fun than\Nthe festival itself.
0.5;I guess it's too late\Nfor that now...
0.5;Come with me! You're going\Nto explain everything today!
0.5;I saw your incredible\Ndetective work on the monitor!
0.5;I was in the middle\Nof taping a drama,

0.5;All the windows, but the one\Nwe entered from, are fixed in place.
0.5;It'd be impossible to use\Nstring to lock it from the outside.

0.5;But, Mori-san, how did\Nthe killer get here?
0.5;Only the snow in front\Nof the window was trampled...
0.5;Climbing up the cliff\Nwould be impossible,
0.5;and the rough waves in the lake\Nwould quickly capsize any boat.
0.5;this study room was\Nstill as good as locked...

0.5;That's the movie\NTadokoro-san brought him!
0.5;It was Dorakura-sensei's\Nmost beloved vampire film.
0.5;So, the killer set it up to look\Nlike the movie's last scene?!
0.5;Meaning he's probably\Nbeen dead for at least an hour.
0.5;In short, the time of the murder\Nwas between 9:00 and 11:00 pm.
0.5;He must've been hit with this.\NThere's some blood on it.
0.5;He was strung up and impaled with\Nthe stake after being knocked out.
0.5;Mori-san, that stake came\Nfrom the collection room!
0.5;after Tadokoro-san\Ncame to get the movie.
0.5;Then, after Tadokoro-san delivered\Nthe movie to the study room,
0.5;But all the windows\Nwere locked from the inside.
0.5;There's not a single\Nfootprint outside the window.
0.5;The only one who\Ncould've stolen the stake
0.5;But, Mori-san, how exactly\Ndid I take the stake to the study?
0.5;I would've had to pass through\Nthe living room, where you all were.
0.5;I don't need your help!\NI already knew that!
0.5;If I wanted to leave, I would still\Nhave to go through the living room.
0.5;Your room is above\Nthe collection room, yes?
0.5;Ma'am, you conspired\Nwith Hamura-san, didn't you?
0.5;You could dangle a rope to the\Ncollection room window from here.
0.5;Hamura-san used it\Nto climb up to your room,
0.5;then traversed the corridor\Nroof to reach the study.
0.5;He then scaled the roof there\Nand set down in front of that window.
0.5;Then, he called out to\NMr. Dorakura to let him inside,
0.5;then murdered him\Nwhen he got the chance!
0.5;He used the same course\Nin reverse to get back.
0.5;Why would Hamura-san and I need\Nto conspire to kill my husband?!
0.5;Mr. Dorakura suspected\Nyou of having an affair.
0.5;Ma'am, were you having\Nan affair with Hamura-san?
0.5;The police would find\Nout right away, anyway.
0.5;Dorakura was an old\Nacquaintance of my father's,
0.5;and in exchange for\Nfinancing the business,
0.5;he demanded my hand in marriage\Nafter I had just graduated college!
0.5;so many people, and families,\Nwould be affected!
0.5;We later learned\Nthat the business' downfall
0.5;But, by the time we found out,\Nthe company was already in his name,
0.5;and he threatened to destroy\Nthe company if we divorced...
0.5;If Mr. Dorakura died, his wife\Nwould inherit his company...
0.5;Very well. If that's how\Nyou want it, then I'll show you.
0.5;You left her room, climbed onto\Nthe corridor roof from this window,
0.5;Which is why Hamura-san's\Nfootprints are still on the roof!
0.5;With the corridor unusable, this roof\Nwas the only way to the study!
0.5;Don't tell me the killer actually\Nflew through the air, like a vampire?!
0.5;First, I thought only Hamura-san\Ncould have taken the stake,
0.5;but actually, anyone could\Nhave stolen it from outside!
0.5;There were no footprints because\Nthe killer walked through the air.

0.5;Better watch out, or she'll\Nsteal your Mitsuaki-san, too!
0.5;She's simply upset that\Nshe hasn't found a man yet...

0.5;Hey! Hideomi! Wait!\NWhat're you so mad for?
0.5;Oh? You're not going to\Ncelebrate with us tonight?
0.5;He's still green,\Nbut he's got good intuition.
0.5;I'm sure he'll be of\Nuse to Detective Mori!
0.5;I'd like to use this opportunity\Nto make an announcement.

0.5;Yes. I've been having her stay here\Nso she would grow used to the house!
0.5;He's probably embarrassed.\NI'll go get him.

0.5;This is Mitsuaki.\NCould you put my father on?!
0.5;He's asleep at the moment.\NWe're just about to leave...
0.5;Someone cut the\Nlights and attacked me with--
0.5;Mitsuaki-san!\NWhat's going on?! Mitsuaki-san!
0.5;I'll check around\Noutside with the guards!
0.5;Is it true that the killer is\NMr. Nagato's son, Hideomi-san?
0.5;Hideomi-san didn't do it!\NThere must be some reason...
0.5;He's still a murderer,\Nwhatever the reason!
0.5;Besides, we don't know\Nhe's the person we saw!
0.5;We only saw someone\Nwith bandages on their face.
0.5;Hideomi-san had burn\Nscars all over his face...
0.5;We saw the killer\Nshortly after 10:00 pm,
0.5;when everyone happened\Nto be in the third-story bedroom.
0.5;Me, Heiji, Ran, Conan, Take-san\Nthe butler, and Yasue-san.
0.5;I stayed in the room\Nwith the president.
0.5;To think the killer prepared\Nthat grappling hook to escape...
0.5;There's no question\Nthat the killer used it.
0.5;We looked for him while\Nthe police were on their way.
0.5;At any rate, we've found the\Nkiller's weapon, hat, and bandages.
0.5;What's this on his right hand?\NIt's like he was stabbed by something.
0.5;The exterior security cameras show\Nnobody leaving after the murder!
0.5;I came to see what all\Nthe noise was about.
0.5;I was irritated, so I\Nhad a drink in my room.
0.5;Yes. While complaining\Nto a friend on the phone.
0.5;It must be the alcohol,\Nbut I can't recall who it was.
0.5;Anyway, is it true that\NHideomi killed Mitsuaki-san?
0.5;Those two would fight every\Ntime they saw each other.
0.5;They seemed to be\Nfriends since childhood,
0.5;but they were like cat\Nand dog after the incident...
0.5;Yes. There was a big fire\Nat a nearby inn twenty years ago.
0.5;Hideomi and Mitsuaki-san,\Nhigh-schoolers at the time, passed by it.
0.5;Mitsuaki-san tried to stop him,\Nbut Hideomi plunged into the flames
0.5;Yes, ever since everyone\Nleft the room in an uproar,
0.5;Did anything strange\Nhappen afterward?!
0.5;Nothing at all. Hyuga-kun stayed\Nwith me until Ran-san arrived.
0.5;But this is no time to look\Nfor your first love now...
0.5;Tell me already!\NWhy'd you bring me here!
0.5;Actually, the president said he\Nheard strange sounds last night.
0.5;Someone sprinting through\Nthe hall in the middle of the night,
0.5;and something hitting\Nsomething else, lots of times!
0.5;was doing something\Nfor tonight's murder!
0.5;The killer musta been really\Nconfident with his plan.
0.5;What bothers me are the killer's\Nitems that were lying by the body.
0.5;And the way the killer purposely\Nshowed his face to us...
0.5;The only one who coulda done that\Nis Nobuko-san, who left beforehand!
0.5;We then searched every nook\Nand cranny of the mansion,
0.5;We were all about to give\Nup two evenings later, when...
0.5;So, are you saying\Nhe held back for me?!
0.5;No, I just meant that he\Nthought highly of you...
0.5;But that pen is my father's\Nkeepsake! Without it, I...
0.5;Madam kept carp in it,\Nbut once she passed away...
0.5;He's been dead for\Napproximately 1.5 to 2 days.
0.5;Mitsuaki-san was\Npushed off the veranda
0.5;at 10:00 the night before last,\N44 hours ago.
0.5;but he likely ingested poison\Nbefore entering the pond.
0.5;The body didn't float up because\Nof these rocks in his clothes.
0.5;So, Hideomi-san carried the rocks\Ninto the pond and poisoned himself?!
0.5;He probably didn't want\Nanyone to see him dead.
0.5;Still, as hostile as Hideomi-san and\NMitsuaki-san were with each other,
0.5;It's possible. Hideomi-sama and\NYasue-ojousama were very close,
0.5;so he was vehemently against\Nher marriage with Mitsuaki-sama.
0.5;So, he couldn't stomach the\Nidea of losing his dear little sister
0.5;"""The marks on the knife match\Nthe wounds on Mitsuaki-san's arm,"
0.5;and the blood on the\Nknife matches his, as well.
0.5;"The hair follicles in the hat and\Nbandages belong to Hideomi-san."""
0.5;That reminds me, there was\Na meter-long grappling hook
0.5;Was the cut on his right\Nhand from the knife, too?
0.5;What about the blood type\Nof the saliva on the knife?!
0.5;There wasn't any.\NSeems it was wiped off...

0.5;But the only time\Nanyone got near the pond
0.5;In other words, Hideomi-san had\Nbeen murdered before it happened!

0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Those ladies over there are devoted \Nfans of the Detective Boys.
0.5;We were on a luxurious sightseeing \Nbus tour of Beika City.
0.5;Since then, the Detective \NBoys have become Sakura-sama,
0.5;Sumire-sama, Botan-sama \Nand Azami-sama's idols.
0.5;Since all the members of the \NDetective Boys are here...
0.5;Imagine that the Detective Boys \Nare your own grandchildren
0.5;I had it remodeled in a \NBaroque architectural style.
0.5;It was my dream to sing \Nlullabies to my grandchildren.
0.5;She put herself to sleep \Nwith her own lullaby.
0.5;It was my dream to peel fruit from \Naround the world for my grandchildren.
0.5;I especially like these dentures \Ndecorated with diamonds.
0.5;As soon as we entered \NSumire-baachan's room...
0.5;I guess we can let it slide \Nsince they're our fans.
0.5;and Administration Manager \NTango-san that creep me out.
0.5;Maybe they have to smile because \Nthey're the chief director
0.5;Isn't that what they call \Na customer service smile?
0.5;I understand why other nursing \Nhomes would want them to move in.
0.5;By letting them meet their \Nidols the Detective Boys,
0.5;We need to buy a high-class hotel in \NDubai before those old hags catch on.
0.5;If those old hags learned we're planning \Nto buy a high-class hotel in Dubai,
0.5;A world famous resort \Ncity in the Middle East.
0.5;They said they're planning to buy a \Nhotel using the old women's money.
0.5;They're using their money \Nwithout their knowledge.
0.5;Darling, you're my husband. \NYou should decide.
0.5;I'm sick of taking care of \Nwealthy old Japanese people.

0.5;We'll care for the world's wealthy \Nold people and use their money

0.5;We need to make those old hags \Nsign an exclusive contract
0.5;so they can't be scouted by \Nanother nursing home again.
0.5;Ow. I hurt my teeth biting \Nhim as hard as I could.
0.5;They've installed multiple \Nsolid locks on the door.
0.5;You don't need to smile like \Nthat when you're angry.

0.5;We were on our way back \Nfrom working on a case

0.5;I happened to be walking around \Nthe area when I heard a crash.
0.5;By the time I ran over, \Nit was already like this.
0.5;Which means we'll have to \Nask him what happened.
0.5;So we'll have to wait for \Nhim to regain consciousness.
0.5;His ID card indicates he's Tsutsumi \NNaohiro-san, 31 years old.
0.5;The cause of death was most \Nlikely a brain contusion
0.5;He was probably drunk \Nand jumped into traffic.
0.5;All you ever do is get in \Nthe way at crime scenes.
0.5;So if we wanted to inspect \Nthe scene with him...
0.5;In that case, could you \Ncome this way, please?
0.5;We started around the same time \Nand were relatively good friends.
0.5;We were laughing about \Nleaving the company

0.5;You said you were on your \Nway home after dinner,

0.5;do you have any idea why he \Nmay have wanted to kill himself?
0.5;If I run out of options, \Nmaybe I'll kill myself.
0.5;So he'd been fired from his \Njob and had money troubles.
0.5;I can't believe he was so \Ndepressed he killed himself.
0.5;Well, there's nothing particularly \Nsuspicious about this case.
0.5;that'll depend on the traffic \Ndivision's investigation,
0.5;But I doubt it'll be worse \Nthan forward inattention
0.5;and professional negligence \Nresulting in death.
0.5;The traffic division sure\Nis taking their time.
0.5;there was a multi-car crash \Nat Beika Ohashi Bridge.
0.5;This was a premeditated murder \Ncarried out by Kikuchi-san.
0.5;I was fooled by Kikuchi-san's \Nbrilliant acting.
0.5;Kikuchi-san said a person carrying \Nan umbrella jumped into the street.
0.5;Maybe the umbrella closed when he \Nwas struck during the accident.
0.5;That umbrella is what's known \Nas an automatic umbrella.
0.5;the runner must be \Nslid down the umbrella.
0.5;As you can see, unless you're \Ndeliberately closing it,
0.5;It's hard to imagine he closed \Nit himself after he was hit.
0.5;Tsutsumi-san closed his umbrella \Nso he could get into your car.
0.5;When you returned to your \Ncar to get your umbrella,
0.5;you closed the passenger side \Ndoor, turning off the dome lights.
0.5;someone opened the passenger \Nside door at some point.
0.5;Are you sure you weren't \Ntrying to hide the truth
0.5;because you believed the dome \Nlights would be evidence
0.5;that you tried to get \NTsutsumi-san into your car?
0.5;Kikuchi-san, you called Tsutsumi-san \Nto this deserted street,
0.5;After closing his umbrella so he \Ncould get into the passenger seat,
0.5;He must have received the abrasions \Non his right-hand fingers then.
0.5;The side view mirror bent \Nforward on the passenger side
0.5;The mirror must have hit Tsutsumi-san's \Nbody while he was reversing.
0.5;you exited the car with the suicide \Nnote you prepared in your hand.
0.5;Then you hid it in \NTsutsumi-san's jacket pocket,
0.5;That's not enough to definitively \Nsay I'm a murderer, right?
0.5;it's impossible to pin the \Nmurder on Kikuchi-san.
0.5;Look at the note found \Non Tsutsumi-san's body.
0.5;could you search the dashboard \Nin Kikuchi-san's car?
0.5;It's car wax and a towel he \Nprobably used to wipe it.
0.5;You were probably hoping the rain \Nwould wash away the evidence,
0.5;I just wanted to bring \Nsomeone down with me.

0.5;There's still tons of secret\Ntreasure all over the world

0.5;What if it really is a 100%\Ngenuine treasure map?!
0.5;From this day forth we'll be known\Nas the Junior Detective Club!
0.5;Haven't you seen this\Nsomewhere before?
0.5;Dino Cavane, the Italian crime lord\Nwho was arrested last night
0.5;at an apartment complex near Tokyo Tower,\Nhas so far refused to say anything.
0.5;The police are currently\Npursuing Cavane's accomplices,
0.5;but they have been unable to find any\Nclues leading to their whereabouts.
0.5;The location of the 15,000\NMaple Leaf gold coins they stole
0.5;I thought the Tokyo Tower was\Nsuspicious from the very beginning!
0.5;But what do you think\Nthese letters mean?
0.5;The first O stands for ookii,\Nwhich means big!
0.5;So, that means it's a big treasure\Nthat will make you rich!
0.5;Alright! I'm gonna use that treasure\Nto eat the world's best eel dishes!
0.5;I'm gonna go around\Nthe world 100 times!
0.5;I'm going to buy a space shuttle\Nfrom NASA and go into space!
0.5;But none of the other symbols\Nlook like anything,
0.5;except for the one that\Nlooks like an umbrella...
0.5;and I doubt you could specify exact\Nlocations with such simple drawings.
0.5;I was wondering if the other symbols\Nare abbreviations for things.
0.5;Like this symbol beneath\Nthe tower could be a hat.
0.5;The umbrella beneath that could be\Nan emblem on a sweater or something.
0.5;And the thing that links\Nthem all together...
0.5;There has to be a clue\Nin here somewhere!
0.5;Looks like it didn't have to do\Nwith clothing stores after all...
0.5;Stupid! You can't eat\Nanything at a bookstore!
0.5;Which means this code really\Ndoes show where treasure is!
0.5;The accomplices of the Italian\Ncrime lord Dino Cavane,
0.5;who was caught yesterday,\Nare currently in Japan.
0.5;The whereabouts of the 15,000\NMaple Leaf coins they stole
0.5;These coins, which total over\N600 million in Japanese yen, were...
0.5;600 million, huh? These guys\Nmust know what they're doing.
0.5;If you mean Conan-kun,\Nhe left early this morning
0.5;to go to the art museum\Nwith his friends.
0.5;Come on, Dad! At least help\Nclean up a little!
0.5;three of Cavane's accomplices are on\Nthe run, and one of them is Japanese.
0.5;How should I know? That's all\Nhe's been doing since we got here!
0.5;Do you think maybe he\Nfigured something out?
0.5;It's hopeless!\NI can't figure it out!
0.5;Is it a map? Or is it\Nsome kind of message?!
0.5;See! That sign! It looks\Njust like the 2nd symbol!
0.5;Could these symbols\Nactually represent...?
0.5;It has to be! This shop's directly\Nin front of Tokyo Tower,
0.5;and the next symbol has\Nthe shape of this sign!
0.5;So, if we follow this order of\Nstore signs, we'll find the treasure!
0.5;But which way should\Nwe go from here?
0.5;You're right! It looks\Njust like the third symbol!
0.5;This code is a map from Tokyo\NTower to the Nanbu Aquarium!
0.5;They drew the signs and displays\Nof stores along Moon View Street!
0.5;I didn't see the 5th star-shaped\Nsymbol anywhere...
0.5;Darn! And we were so close\Nto the treasure!
0.5;We never even found the 5th\Nsymbol on Moon View Street
0.5;between Tokyo Tower\Nand the Nanbu Aquarium!
0.5;would use the moon symbol\Nto represent Moon View Street,
0.5;The moon represents night and the\Nthings you can only see at night!
0.5;This is a treasure map comprised\Nof the shapes of various neon signs.
0.5;The neon sign in the\N2nd symbol is over there!
0.5;We just need to find\Nan umbrella-shaped sign!
0.5;I don't see any umbrella-shaped\Nsigns anywhere...
0.5;What're you talking about?\NThat's the sun.
0.5;Rain must've been in the forecast\Nfor the day after they wrote the code!
0.5;Next is a neon sign\Nshaped like a star!
0.5;There's no doubt about it!\NIt's the 5th symbol!
0.5;So, we should see\Nthe 6th sign from here!
0.5;Say, Conan, there's really\Ngonna be treasure here, right?
0.5;"Yeah. This symbol has ""ORO""\Nwritten next to it, after all."
0.5;I've been looking for the\Nlast fish-shaped sign for a while,
0.5;This is a residential street.\NThere's nothing on it.
0.5;The closest fish would probably\Nbe in a nearby river or something.
0.5;Quit yer yappin'! The treasure has\Nto be at the bottom of this river!
0.5;No! This code represents things\Nyou can only see at night!
0.5;So, the fish symbol at the end\Ncan't represent the river.
0.5;If my guess is correct,\Nthen it has to be somewhere nearby!
0.5;Is there really gonna\Nbe a glowing fish here?!
0.5;Hey! It's so dark I can't see anything,\Nmuch less any fish!
0.5;And the fish's eye is the light\Non the building in front of us!
0.5;by looping the rope around part\Nof the ceiling that sticks out!
0.5;Weren't they the ones I saw\Nin front of Tokyo Tower?
0.5;I see. They still don't know\Nwhere the coins are.
0.5;Members of that Italian\Ncrime ring, most likely!
0.5;Come to think of it, I heard\Nabout them on the news!
0.5;That means those coins\Njust now must've been--
0.5;We swiped these coins from\Nan Italian bank a year ago.
0.5;But then he backstabbed\Nus and ran off to Japan.
0.5;With the 15,000 Maple Leaf\Ncoins in tow, of course.
0.5;We tailed him to Japan\Nand paid him a visit!
0.5;He wouldn't tell us where he hid 'em,\Nno matter how much we interrogated him.
0.5;He wouldn't help us out, so we\Ninformed the police of his location,
0.5;The wind blew the paper away\Nwhen we stopped by the art museum.
0.5;But we saw you cracking\Nthe code little by little,
0.5;Never imagined you'd actually\Nfind it for us though!
0.5;The coins are hidden at the\Nlocation where the fish symbol
0.5;and the night view of the bridge\Noutside match up!
0.5;We're as good as dead\Nonce they find the treasure!
0.5;I bet they're gonna stick us in cement\Nand drop us into the ocean...
0.5;No, they're going to burn us to death\Nso there's no proof left behind!
0.5;The moment that they find the\Ncoins and let their guard down!
0.5;Afterward, we went straight\Nto a nearby police station
0.5;To everyone's delight, the gang was\Narrested and the case was closed.
0.5;It wound up being the Junior Detective\NClub's very first accomplishment!
0.5;And I used my reasoning\Nto decipher the code!
0.5;It was Conan-kun who cracked\Nthe code and beat up the gang!
0.5;There's only one way\Nto make her believe me!
0.5;If I tell her that\NI'm actually Shinichi Kudo!
0.5;Ran brought me to the Beika \NAquarium to help prepare for her
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;Cell phone movies in an \Nunderwater passageway.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;She's wearing a miniskirt, reeks of \Nperfume, and is about 160 centimeters.
0.5;So you're the one who came to \Nthe aquarium with the victim?
0.5;But he went to the bathroom during \Nthe show and never came back.
0.5;I was looking for him to give him \Nan earful, but that was a shock.
0.5;Everyone around me said he'd \Nbeen stabbed, so I ignored it.
0.5;I thought the guy who stabbed \Nhim might be coming for me.
0.5;He was having a sketchy \Nconversation on his phone.
0.5;"Something about, \N""I'll definitely get the money."""
0.5;Were you with your\Nboyfriend the whole time?
0.5;It's been ten minutes, \Nbut nothing's happening.
0.5;Ran, go to the entrance\Nand get an employee.
0.5;Maybe he called so he \Ncould introduce her to me.
0.5;And that the man killed here \Ntoday was her ex-boyfriend.
0.5;"You mean the one that said, \N""Contact me immediately?"""
0.5;I've received prank messages from that \Naddress before, so I deleted it right away.
0.5;You're saying they came \Nfrom Naho's ex-boyfriend?
0.5;You seemed to have been filming with \Nher when the incident occurred.
0.5;Ran, go to the entrance\Nand get an employee.
0.5;We were going to upload \Nit to our blogs later.
0.5;We compared Nakagiri-san's dolphin \Nshow video to those of other guests.
0.5;It was definitely taken \Nwhen the incident occurred.
0.5;Most hallways are too dark \Nto see more than silhouettes.
0.5;I thought the tunnel might \Nhave some significance.
0.5;That's because there are \Nfish everywhere you look.
0.5;It feels like you're at \Nthe bottom of the ocean.
0.5;This place that appears \Nsurrounded by the ocean!
0.5;It was shaky, and the sound \Nquality was terrible.
0.5;Compared to yours, Jinbe-san's \Nvideo was fantastic.
0.5;You got a clear shot of a \Nleisurely swimming shark.
0.5;You were going to upload \Nit to your blog, too.
0.5;J-Just that mine's horizontal \Nand hers is vertical.
0.5;Normally if you wanted to shoot \Na long fish like a shark,
0.5;Normally people avoid walking into the \Nshot when they see someone filming.
0.5;It's as though they had \Nno idea she was filming.
0.5;You'd have to look closely to notice \Na white phone in a white hat.
0.5;The video looks like she \Ntook it from behind him.
0.5;With fish on all sides, fish will appear in\Nthe shot no matter which way you shoot.
0.5;When I spoke from your side, you turned\Nyour entire body instead of just your neck.
0.5;While looking at your video, you held your \Nphone directly in front of your face.
0.5;That's how I knew he couldn't look \Ndown because he injured his neck.
0.5;Then while he was filming, \NOjiro-san killed him.
0.5;She found the victim waiting \Nfor her in this tunnel
0.5;She returned to her boyfriend \Nand retrieved her phone.
0.5;and puts on a hat, \Nshe looks like a different person.
0.5;Unfortunately, there was one \Nthing you couldn't change.
0.5;Based on your clothes, \NI knew you took it today.
0.5;You also showed the inspector \Nyour phone with your right hand.
0.5;But you removed your left glove and \Nused your phone with your left.
0.5;and the fact that some blood \Nspilled through the plastic bag
0.5;He threatened to leak embarrassing photos\Nof me online for breaking up with him.
0.5;Inside were embarrassing \Npictures of me he took.
0.5;he used my phone while\NI was in the bathroom.
0.5;"""If you don't want your boyfriend, job, and\Nfamily seeing these photos, give me money."""
0.5;If I hadn't reversed my gloves, \Nyou may not have known.
0.5;In Jinbe-san's video, you were \Nwearing both of your gloves.
0.5;You took one off when you used your left \Nhand, so they're ordinary wool gloves.
0.5;You need to be barehanded \Nto use a smart phone.
0.5;It was proof you'd done something \Nthat required you to wear them.
0.5;After what happened, you shouldn't \Nuse your Romantic Reunion Plan there.
0.5;I was thinking of where \Nthe culprit put her phone.
0.5;Nothing good ever happens\Nwhen I'm with you!
0.5;Things kept happening when \Nwe went to America, too...
0.5;I'm sure nothing will happen \Nat an amusement park.
0.5;Okay, then how about if I \Nwin my karate tournament?
0.5;And if you're buying me a phone, get a sea \Ncucumber strap from the aquarium, too.
0.5;I'm at the Beika Aquarium \Nwe visited together.
0.5;Come to think of it, I've been \Nwondering about that, too.
0.5;You just checked your mom's message \Nand didn't respond to Sonoko's, right?
0.5;weren't dexterous enough\N to write an e-mail.
0.5;Since you didn't remove your glove, \Nyou probably bandaged your hand.
0.5;You were determined to \Nwin your tournament,
0.5;Because you couldn't link \Nthem with your fingers.
0.5;I sat behind you, so I could \Nsee when you leaned forward.
0.5;You'd never let your dad \Nhook your bras for you.
0.5;Sonoko had a cold, and you wouldn't\Ngo see your mom just to put on a bra.
0.5;but when you run without a bra, your \Nbreasts bounce all over the place,
0.5;making your Cooper's ligaments \Nstretch and droop over time.
0.5;you can attach them in front \Nand rotate them around...
0.5;Why would you make me\Nsay that?! You idiot!
0.5;"The car in front transporting ""Scream"" \Nsuddenly drove off course and disappeared!"
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Disappearance of Munch's Scream!"""
0.5;As long as modern-day\Ncrimes involve people,
0.5;there are no\Nunsolvable mysteries!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Don't blame me,\Nblame my hangover...
0.5;He's the one who suggested\Nit in the first place...
0.5;Okay, only two more\Nkilometers to the park!
0.5;It appears something\Nhappened outside.
0.5;It looks like that iron\Ngirder fell on him from above...
0.5;Meaning this\Ngirder fell from the roof?
0.5;We were cleaning the\Nbuilding across the street--
0.5;Sorry to ask, but could you\Ncheck out this abandoned building?
0.5;Someone might have\Ndropped the girder from it.
0.5;It's just my luck that\NI'd run into a big incident
0.5;So Fujii-san was on his\Nway from his office up ahead
0.5;Yes. He was supposed to meet\Nthe company president at 9:00.
0.5;Oh, that's right!\NI need to inform him about this!
0.5;Move the Manbo Mobile away\Nfrom that building right away!
0.5;It'll be in the way when\Nthe police get here! Hurry!
0.5;Now, then. When\Nthe incident occurred,
0.5;and Asagi-san was in\Nthe room next door. Right?
0.5;Is there anyone\Nwho can vouch for this?
0.5;Mori-kun here asked\Nyour employees to inspect
0.5;But they didn't find\Nanyone suspicious, right?
0.5;the iron girder was dropped\Nfrom the roof of this building.
0.5;Floors 3 and up belong\Nto a parent company.
0.5;I hear floors 1 and 2 are\Nbeing rented out to your company.
0.5;And from what\Nthe security guard told us,
0.5;the parent company above\Nyou is closed because it's Sunday.
0.5;There wasn't anyone\Nelse to vouch for us...
0.5;Now I see! The camera's\Nangle changes automatically!
0.5;you use this stick\Nto change the angle...
0.5;Hey, you! Don't touch\Nother people's things!
0.5;This company was originally just me,\NFujii, and my sister Kumiko
0.5;"We originally started it\Nas a ""jack-of-all-trades"" shop."
0.5;because we would actively go\Nto random homes and demand work.
0.5;Two years later,\Nwe took our first step into cleaning
0.5;by creating the\NOjamanbo Cleaning Company.
0.5;I took the role\Nof company president,
0.5;and Fujii oversaw work as business\Ndirector of the eastern region.
0.5;but she died in\Nan accident in January.
0.5;I'll tell you since you'd\Neventually find out anyway,
0.5;there was some\Ntrouble between me and Fujii.
0.5;Fujii was going to start his\Nown cleaning company by himself.
0.5;Because of this, he tried to take\Nseveral highly-skilled employees
0.5;Whenever we met, we always\Nclashed with each other.
0.5;I was supposed to talk\Nwith Fujii again today.
0.5;Nakayama-san was the one\Nwho dropped the girder from the roof!
0.5;The reason being that\Nshe's getting married next month!
0.5;It wasn't much, but we found\Na mark made by an iron girder
0.5;So the girder fell from the\Nroof of the abandoned building!
0.5;His name's on it, so it would\Nseem it belongs to Fujii-san...
0.5;However, we couldn't\Nfind any fingerprints on it at all.
0.5;I just remembered\Nsome unimportant business.
0.5;Would you mind\Nif I leave for just a bit?
0.5;Asagi-san. Contact Fujii-kun's\Nparents and fiancée.
0.5;Yes. Apparently she's the\Ndaughter of a wealthy man,
0.5;and the start-up funds\Nfor his new company
0.5;Say, how did\NNakayama-san's sister die?
0.5;Apparently she had a\Nbig argument with her brother
0.5;But she took a part-time\Njob at a construction company
0.5;That's why I've been thinking about\Nhow terrible coincidences can be...
0.5;Could his sister's\Ndeath have some relevance
0.5;If so, then it's highly likely\Nthat Nakayama-san did it!
0.5;At any rate, I'm going to\Nre-question the employees
0.5;who were cleaning the\Nbuilding across the street.
0.5;After entering this room, Nakayama-san\Nswitched the camera to Auto.
0.5;If he's the killer, then it\Nmust be the key to something!
0.5;I can see the road out front!\NThis is neat!
0.5;to make sure there's no litter\Non the street in front of the building.
0.5;I see. So it's the policy of the\Npresident of a cleaning company.
0.5;Parking it in front of a spotless\Nbuilding makes for great publicity!
0.5;but do you think we could see\Ninside that alley if it was on Manual?
0.5;I'm not sure.\NWhy don't you try and see?
0.5;You know better than to\Nopen other people's drawers!
0.5;The abandoned building next\Ndoor is one floor shorter than this one...
0.5;That must be the mark\Nmade by the sliding iron girder.
0.5;This height difference\Nwould make it impossible
0.5;to return the girder up\Nhere if it had been lowered
0.5;Which means Nakayama-san\Ncouldn't have dropped it--
0.5;Plus, he was in his\Noffice when it happened!
0.5;It's not much, but there's\Na fresh scratch mark here
0.5;Using this method, it would\Nbe possible to drop the girder
0.5;But how did he know\NFujii-san was in the alley?!
0.5;None of the lower floors\Nreflect what's in the alley!
0.5;Was it really impossible for\NNakayama-san to have done it?!
0.5;Move the Manbo Mobile away\Nfrom that building right away!
0.5;That's why the harmonica\Ndidn't have any fingerprints on it!
0.5;Apparently they had\Nfinished their window-cleaning
0.5;and moved on to cleaning\Nthe first floor when it happened.
0.5;that he controlled the\Nonly camera on the roof?!
0.5;Ah, Nakayama-san.\NYou can leave for today.
0.5;I have no choice!\NI'll use my usual method!
0.5;Inspector. You mustn't\Nlet him leave just yet.
0.5;Nakayama-san used to murder\NFujii-san from this room.
0.5;Yes. The key to his trick was\Nthe security camera on the roof.
0.5;Nakayama-san placed an iron\Ngirder on top of the building next door
0.5;and then connected it to the\Nsecurity camera with something thin--
0.5;Afterward, when Fujii-san\Nwalked into the alleyway,
0.5;which had been\Nset to Manual in advance.
0.5;The reason Nakayama-san had\NAsagi-san check what happened outside
0.5;and remove the piano wire\Nfrom the camera.
0.5;And the reason\Nhe went outside just now
0.5;You're not only wrong, but your\Ntheory lacks a vital part, Mori-san.
0.5;From in here,\Nhow could I have known what time
0.5;It would be impossible\Nto drop the girder on Fujii-san
0.5;In order to have Fujii-san\Nstop on a specific spot,
0.5;Nakayama-san stole\Nhis harmonica in advance
0.5;He then used his binoculars\Nto see Fujii-san enter the alley.
0.5;How? The alley\Nisn't visible from here!
0.5;in front of a\Nbuilding across the street.
0.5;Nakayama-san used binoculars to\Nview the reflection of the alley
0.5;That's why you had\Nthe Manbo Mobile moved
0.5;So that the police\Nwouldn't figure out your trick.
0.5;You dropped the girder before\NFujii-san had picked up the harmonica.
0.5;That's why his\Nfingerprints weren't on it.
0.5;Because Ran got in your\Nway at the worst possible time.
0.5;But you have no\Nproof of this, Mori-san.
0.5;According to your theory,\NI've already disposed of the piano wire.
0.5;After you used the security\Ncamera to drop the girder,
0.5;to make it easier to\Nremove the piano wire.
0.5;During that time,\Nthe camera recorded
0.5;the reflection in the glass\Nwindows of the opposite building.
0.5;See the camera in\Nthe glass's reflection?
0.5;and ditched my\Nsister like it was nothing.
0.5;As a result,\Nmy sister quit the company.
0.5;So it wasn't because\Nyou two had an argument?
0.5;Our parents died\Nwhen we were very young.
0.5;so she quit the company\Nto get away from her brother.
0.5;I went to her apartment in\NYokohama to tend to her belongings.
0.5;So then you wiped the\Nharmonica and put it in the alley?
0.5;If Fujii hadn't dumped her,\Nshe wouldn't have died!
0.5;I used the Manbo Mobile's\Nmirror to commit a murder--
0.5;and then I was found guilty because\Nof my reflection in those windows.
0.5;And it was no other\Nthan your own company
0.5;The Ojamanbo Cleaning Company's\Ncleaning techniques
0.5;It looks like the company's still\Ngoing even after the president's arrest.
0.5;I'm Ojamanbo's new announcer,\NKuniko Asagi!
0.5;No! She must have found a clue\Nwe don't know about yet!
0.5;Now that you mention it, Ayako-san\Nwas acting odd this afternoon...
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shooting comet,
0.5;a pop-up doll,\Nand broken ceramic!
0.5;Mystery-solving logic is helpful\Nagainst people's dry hearts!
0.5;Today's a beautiful illustrator!\NHer mischievous streak means death!
0.5;He sees the single truth for what it is,\Nand there's no outwitting him!
0.5;I didn't tell you?\NIt's being released next month
0.5;by painter and president of this\Ndesign office, Hanaoka-sensei!
0.5;I asked both of you to come\Ntoday for an interview
0.5;to put at the end\Nof the collection...
0.5;It's just that Dad said it was\Na collection of paintings of him!
0.5;Isn't it a nice color?\Nlt went on sale today!
0.5;Aren't you supposed to meet\Nsome detective at 5:00?
0.5;I put your pants\Nand socks on for you.
0.5;That way she'd divorce you\Nand we could be together.
0.5;I told you our relationship\Nis business only!
0.5;That's why you're able\Nto paint whatever you want
0.5;She's already vaguely suspicious.\NBut she overlooks it.
0.5;I don't mean us.\NI mean the paintings.
0.5;Sixty percent of your paintings\Nwere actually done by me.
0.5;If word gets out, you can kiss\Nyour reputation goodbye.
0.5;You won't be able to\Nsell a single painting.
0.5;Who'd ever believe\Na new illustrator?!
0.5;Oh, you didn't know?\NI clearly marked each one I drew.
0.5;Take a good look beneath\Nyour signature on the paintings I did.
0.5;I've placed that mark\Non all of my original works.
0.5;Thanks to your increase in work,\Nthey've become rather famous...
0.5;I stayed up all night\Npainting another.
0.5;Be sure to have it delivered\Nto the publisher later.
0.5;Try as you might,\Nthere's no escape from me...
0.5;No luck. He's not at home,\Nand I get his machine at the studio.
0.5;Maybe Chono-kun's place?\NToday was her deadline...
0.5;A new illustrator.\NShe lives in that building right there.
0.5;Hello, this is Chono.\NI'm away at the moment.
0.5;Hello. This is Tanaka\Nfrom Hanaoka Design.
0.5;What are you looking at,\NConan-kun?
0.5;They left their mattress\Nout in the rain.
0.5;This is taking far too long!\NSorry, but I'm leaving.
0.5;Your studio? We called\Nthere several times...
0.5;Sorry to keep you waiting,\NDetective Mori!
0.5;Huh? What happened\Nto your fingernail?
0.5;Oh, Tanaka-kun.\NChono-kun might call.
0.5;This is Hanaoka.\NAre you feeling any better?
0.5;The deceased is Izumi Chono,\N25 years old.
0.5;Hanaoka-san. She was an illustrator\Nfor your design firm, correct?
0.5;Yes. She was still new,\Nbut she had a keen sense.
0.5;But on the phone she said she was\Ngoing to die since she had no talent...
0.5;...the next thing I knew,\Nshe had jumped off the veranda...
0.5;...this man, who tried\Nto talk her out of suicide!
0.5;No, there was no one\Non the veranda when she fell.
0.5;Then how did he push her\Noff from so far away?!
0.5;Look at her eyes.\NShe's wearing contacts.
0.5;But she was wearing\Nglasses when she fell.
0.5;Who wears glasses when\Nthey already have contacts in?
0.5;In other words, someone put her\Nglasses on before pushing her off?
0.5;Detective. You saw\Nher jump off for yourself.
0.5;There was nobody else\Non the veranda at the time.
0.5;So this is the veranda\Nshe jumped off of...
0.5;Slippers, a cell phone,\Nand a broken flowerpot...
0.5;The flowerpot pieces\Nlead to the drain...
0.5;You know you shouldn't\Nsneak around alone!
0.5;In which case,\Nthose glasses are the issue...
0.5;Let's search the place! If this was\Na suicide, there might be a will!
0.5;Those are photos she took\Non a recent company trip.
0.5;She liked drawing on\Npeople in their sleep.
0.5;It looks like they're\Nall the same pattern.
0.5;The butterfly comes from\Nthe 'cho' in her name,
0.5;Her illustrations have\Ngotten popular lately...
0.5;Inspector Megure. There was\Nnail polish on the floor.
0.5;I think that's the nail polish\Nthat went on sale today.
0.5;Everyone at school talked\Nabout its unique color.
0.5;Say, isn't that what's on this\Nsheet?
0.5;But she didn't have any\Non her hands or feet.
0.5;The only person wearing\Nthis color was...
0.5;It just happened to be\Npaint of the same color!
0.5;I was working in my studio\Nuntil this morning.
0.5;He's the killer.\NNo question about it.
0.5;That's odd. Judging from that case,\Nshe had soft lenses!
0.5;There was only\Ndisinfectant in the fridge.
0.5;Inspector Megure.\NWe haven't found a will.
0.5;I forgot to leave a pick-up\Nreceipt when I came earlier.
0.5;No, I was told I could pick\Nit up just inside the doorway
0.5;and to come at exactly 6:30.\NI didn't actually meet anyone.
0.5;It says you were the one\Nwho requested the pick-up.
0.5;She told me over the phone\Nthat she finished a painting
0.5;so I simply arranged for a\Ncourier to deliver it to the editors.
0.5;so I made it so she wouldn't\Nhave to wait on the courier.
0.5;Did anything seem odd\Nwhen you entered the apartment?
0.5;Now that you mention it,\Nthe door slammed right open.
0.5;I thought so myself,\Nbut there was no one there.
0.5;Yeah. And then I heard\Nsomething in the back break.
0.5;I've figured it all out! With this trick,\Nit'd be possible to push her off
0.5;What're you doing?!\NI thought you left!
0.5;And now I put this\NButton Speaker on the old man...
0.5;Yes. Chono-san didn't commit suicide.\NShe was murdered!
0.5;Hold on, Mori-kun. You know\Nhe couldn't have done it.
0.5;Quiet! He most certainly\Ncould have done it!
0.5;He just needed strong\Nfishing line and a nail!
0.5;And a soy sauce bottle\Nand hot coffee.
0.5;First, make a loop\Nthat's long enough to go
0.5;from the veranda's railing\Nto the door and back.
0.5;Pull one end through the belt on\Nthe mattress, which'll be our victim,
0.5;and then loop it around\Nthe railing, from the top.
0.5;Then place that loop\Naround the flowerpot,
0.5;pull the line to the door while\Nkeeping the flowerpot from falling,
0.5;and temporarily place the\Nother loop around the intercom.
0.5;Next, slide the victim along the\Nline and dangle her over the edge.
0.5;Naturally, he covered\Nthe victim with the mattress.
0.5;It disguised the body,\Nlike camouflage.
0.5;Lastly, close the door\Non your way out,
0.5;remove the loop around\Nthe intercom, and tie it to the nail.
0.5;Stop the nail outside\Nthe door, and it's all set.
0.5;The door opener was\NHanaoka-san's courier, of course.
0.5;He would open the door at\Nwhatever time he was asked to.
0.5;Interesting theory, but I don't\Nsee any fishing line at all--
0.5;With extra line and a soy sauce bottle,\Nit disappears like magic.
0.5;First, you tie the extra line\Nbetween the victim and flowerpot,
0.5;pull the other end through\Nthe inner and outer drain caps,
0.5;Then you simply place the\Nbottle and the caps into the drain.
0.5;"The bottle is just a weight;\Nanything will do."
0.5;The saline solution missing\Nfrom the refrigerator, for example.
0.5;Seeing is believing...\NLet us open the door...
0.5;...the door of fate that\Nwill solve this mystery!
0.5;Inspector! We already found\Nfishing line and the saline solution!
0.5;Ridiculous! I was on the phone\Nwith her just before she fell!
0.5;Try redialing the office\Nwith the phone on the veranda!
0.5;Because you used it to call the office\Nafter preparing the previous trick.
0.5;And the voice that Tanaka-san\Nheard was probably
0.5;part of the message on the\Nanswering machine in your studio.
0.5;On your way from here to the office,\Nyou stopped by your studio,
0.5;and took the tape\Nwith her voice on it.
0.5;At the office, you went\Nstraight to the restroom
0.5;and called the office\Nfrom your own cell phone.
0.5;you diverted everyone's\Nattention to the opposite veranda
0.5;to make it appear that the\Ndead woman committed suicide.
0.5;The murder weapon was most\Nlikely the ashtray beneath the desk.
0.5;If you test it, it should\Nproduce a luminol reaction.
0.5;Still, do you have any\Nproof that I killed her here?
0.5;I certainly doubt it.\NAfter all, today is my first time here.
0.5;Detective Mori.\NHere's the hot coffee.
0.5;That's right. She drew it with\Nnail polish while he was asleep.
0.5;There was nail polish on the bed,\Nyet she had none on
0.5;And that nail polish\Nwent on sale today.
0.5;If you're innocent,\Nthen answer this.
0.5;When and where did you get\Nthat mark, and from whom?
0.5;It isn't true, is it,\NHanaoka-san?
0.5;I can't believe you\Nwould kill Chono-kun...
0.5;His motive for murder was\Nprobably his paintings.
0.5;Chono-san's signature\Nappeared many times
0.5;Those were probably works\Nthat she made using his style.

0.5;If I just tell her how I feel someplace with \Nbeautiful scenery, I'll be losing to Kudo.
0.5;If I'm going to beat him,\NI'll have to steel my resolve.
0.5;After all, at the Kiyomizu Temple \Nbutai in front of all those people,
0.5;He should've told me beforehand \Nthat he was going to do that.
0.5;I mean, Conan-kun and the others are meeting \Nus today might be visited by Kaito Kid.
0.5;There was a rumor that Kid was standing on \Ntop of the Tsutenkaku Tower the other day,
0.5;Speaking of excitement,\NI'm excited about Kid's target,
0.5;I wish I could see that thin \Npink-colored pearl now.
0.5;If Ran-chan and the others \Nsee, they'll laugh at me.
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;That rich geezer flamboyantly \Npicked a fight with Kid again.
0.5;Anyway, are we seriously \Ngoing to this museum?
0.5;We probably won't get a good look at the \Njewel because of all the crazy security.
0.5;"that allow the jewel to be \Nseen clearly from all angles."""
0.5;This security will allow \Nthat moonlit magician
0.5;to easily steal the jewel \Nand run off with it.
0.5;I'm willing to ignore \Nhim stealing the jewel.
0.5;But don't you have any better strategies \Nto prevent him from escaping?
0.5;if we increase the number of \Nsecurity guards around the jewel,
0.5;the guests coming to see the jewel \Nwon't be able to enjoy themselves.
0.5;In any case, we have one week \Nuntil the jewel goes on display.
0.5;We have to come up with \Na better plan by then.
0.5;We'll probably end up seeing that smug \Nscoundrel's audacious smile again.
0.5;I came all the way down to the Metropolitan \NPolice Department, but I wasted my time.
0.5;Shouldn't we tighten \Nsecurity around the jewel?
0.5;For example, we could encase the jewel's \Ndisplay box inside a metal cage.
0.5;We have to come up with a way \Nto keep him from escaping.
0.5;Attacking the outside without fortifying \Nthe inside is a foolish plan.
0.5;It's what a famous Chinese \Ntactician once said.
0.5;People always question if I have any \Nintention of displaying the object to guests.
0.5;It certainly allows it to be \Nseen clearly from all angles.
0.5;Heat will melt it, and it \Ncan be drilled through.
0.5;Using a blowtorch to melt this \Nmuch ice would take a long time,
0.5;and it's impossible to extract the jewel \Nwith a drill without scratching it.
0.5;Furthermore, we've enclosed the \Njewel's display area in hard glass,
0.5;and lowered the temperature \Ncompared to other rooms.
0.5;it allows the jewel to be observed without \Nan oppressive air of intimidation.
0.5;It was the good idea of the man who returned \Nto offer his assistance again today,
0.5;Nagano Prefectural Police Section \N1's Inspector Morofushi Takaaki.
0.5;would allow guests to enjoy a \Ncool and refreshing experience.
0.5;It's a famous saying from the \NAnnals of the Three Kingdoms.
0.5;The truth is, I came here the \Nother day to confirm something,
0.5;but the detective on the case was \Nout conducting an investigation,
0.5;so I couldn't meet with \Nhim, so I returned today.
0.5;And there was that female \Nofficer serial murder case...
0.5;To be precise, it's a letter that \Nseemed to be addressed to me.
0.5;The letters are blurred \Nand difficult to read.
0.5;because General Advisor Suzuki \NJirokichi asked me to come.
0.5;Apparently he's childhood friends \Nwith Inspector Yamato Kansuke
0.5;and Detective Uehara Yui, \Nwho you've met before.
0.5;Apparently he's actually \Nas smart as Zhuge Kongming.
0.5;Two high school detectives and a \Ntactician-like cop from Nagano?
0.5;And as the days go by, that block \Nof ice will gradually get smaller.
0.5;It's no wonder the general \Nadvisor invited you.
0.5;I was drawn to the brilliance of \Nthe pearl's unique orient effect,
0.5;I'm honored to be part of \Nthis plan to capture Kid.
0.5;In exchange, I expect to be compensated \Nif it actually is stolen.
0.5;After all, this jewel already \Nreceived a high offer at an auction,
0.5;That's a gift my grandfather received \Nfrom a wealthy Caribbean man
0.5;I let you hold onto it because you \Nsaid you'd determine its value,
0.5;I looked into yours because it \Nlooked similar to my own pearl,
0.5;but as I recall, I already \Nreturned yours to you.
0.5;After swapping the jewel \Nout for a fake pearl!
0.5;That pearl was the wedding ring my \Ngrandfather gave to my grandmother!
0.5;Well? Have we still not \Nreceived a note from Kid?
0.5;Heiji, you've been acting weird \Nsince we returned from Kyoto.
0.5;Come to think of it, Hattori-kun was \Nthere at the Kiyomizu Temple butai.
0.5;Kazuha-chan, this time I might \Nactually sense love in the air.
0.5;Anyway, when did Kid stick this \Ncard on the bottom of my shoe?
0.5;Maybe it's been there \Nsince before you got here.
0.5;You'd already decided that \Nyou'd be coming here.
0.5;Actually, it seems he \Nonly just decided to act.
0.5;Look. The card over here says \Nhe'll arrive tomorrow at 8 PM.
0.5;This card says he'll come \Nthe day after tomorrow.
0.5;He placed cards for various times \Naround the room beforehand.
0.5;by having Inspector Nakamori \Nwalk over, step on,
0.5;regardless of the fact that he'd \Nonly just made his decision,
0.5;he wanted us to think that he'd \Nthought long and hard on his plan.
0.5;Naturally, he probably intended to \Nsecretly collect these extra cards later.
0.5;In other words, the officer who just \Ntold me about the strange ball is Kid.
0.5;That tactician-like cop \Nsaw through everything.
0.5;but since I've already rigged the \Nceiling, it's worth testing it out.
0.5;The question is what to do \Nabout that detective kid
0.5;with the glasses and the high \Nschool detective from Osaka.
0.5;I was thinking we could stay \Nat Ran-chan's place tonight.
0.5;As long as we're here, I've \Ngot to stay here until tonight
0.5;W-Well, if you insist on staying, \Nthen I suppose it can't be helped...
0.5;so I had the ring swapped out \Nfor one with an internal sensor.
0.5;If he passes through that \Nexit while holding the ring,
0.5;Furthermore, next to the \Ndoor is an emergency button.
0.5;Once pressed, the door is \Nlocked for ten minutes.
0.5;Kid's crime can be stopped before \Nit begins, ending in failure.
0.5;Wouldn't it be faster for you to \Nbuy the whole newspaper company?
0.5;Damn it. Our plan is to stop Kid \Nfrom coming instead of catch him?
0.5;A commander without courage \Nis no commander at all.
0.5;It means if the commander of \Nan army is without courage,
0.5;then it's like there is \Nno commander on the field.
0.5;Inspector, the regular guests \Nare entering the museum.
0.5;He's cunning. It's never \Nstraightforward with him.
0.5;I wouldn't mind you showing \Nyou something even better.
0.5;This dress is from that brand the magazines \Nare saying is popular this year.
0.5;In that case, I'm going to \Ngo change in the bathroom.
0.5;I feel bad for putting her \Nto sleep in the bathroom,
0.5;I must've left it there after \Ntaking a picture of the ring.
0.5;I won't be able to take a \Npicture of Kid if he shows up.
0.5;Is he planning to drill a \Nhole in the ice and steal it?
0.5;You'd throw something at the \Nmouse if not for the pot.
0.5;Just as you can't throw something \Nat a mouse to kill it
0.5;Kid shouldn't be able to steal \Nthe ring even if he wants to.
0.5;The ink stained the sheet that \Ncame down from the ceiling black.
0.5;There's a long hole in \Nthe middle of the block,
0.5;Looks like I'll have to cover that \Nridiculous mouth in order to keep you quiet.

0.5;They could be waiting there \Nfor a chance to escape.
0.5;It's the underground casino \Nyou attacked a year ago.
0.5;to determine who killed\Nmy son one year ago.
0.5;Pim... Mr. Pimple was killed by \Nthe men of the underground casino.
0.5;When the time comes, the door \Nwill unlock automatically.
0.5;Let's review the circumstances \Nof one year ago.
0.5;Including Mr. Pimple in the \Njob may have been my mistake.
0.5;Mr. Pimple's unidentified body was \Ndiscovered in the burnt wreckage.
0.5;You disguised yourselves as \Nguests and snuck in, right?
0.5;That's why we sent Pim in first \Nto hide the guns and knives.
0.5;Did you get that cut on your \Nfinger from someone biting you?
0.5;There are bite marks on \Nyour knife's handle, too.
0.5;I was threatening it for fun, \Nand it bit my hand and knife.
0.5;I was bitten by a dog in \Nthe neighborhood, and...
0.5;I'll know if they're dog \Nor human teeth marks!
0.5;It spits out casings when you shoot \Nthat clatter around on the floor.
0.5;But it would've been impossible to \Nget through the metal detectors.
0.5;If it were made of... not ceramic \Nor plastic, but something else...
0.5;If the gun were made of resin, the \Nmetal detectors wouldn't find it.
0.5;because they didn't know\Nthe casino would be attacked.
0.5;First, Mr. Mouth used a knife to make \NMr. Pimple hold still during the blackout
0.5;If Pimple was standing \Nthere before the blackout,
0.5;Hey, why did you close your \Neyes before the blackout?
0.5;But like the other guests,\NPim-san didn't close his eyes.
0.5;so you could escape and\Ndestroy the evidence.
0.5;Pim discovered our plan to kill Mr. \NHead and take the money for ourselves.
0.5;contact Inspector Megure immediately \Nand ask for protection.
0.5;This is footage from the \Nunderground casino's cameras.
0.5;to determine who killed\Nmy son one year ago.
0.5;You recorded your voice\Nand used this remote
0.5;to play it back to portray\Nthe faceless client.
0.5;It was a mistake to put him up for \Nadoption so he could have a better life.
0.5;In the end, he was hired \Nwithout realizing who I was.
0.5;Are you going to die with \Nthem to atone for your son?
0.5;He knew you, Miss. Lip, \Nwere Mr. Head and his mother.
0.5;Perhaps he took the job so you \Nwould end your life of crime.
0.5;If he were alive, he'd probably \Ntry to stop you again.
0.5;After being shot by Mr. Eyes, \NMiss. Lip was rushed to the hospital.

0.5;Apparently, he accidentally\Nkilled someone last night.
0.5;He's wanted to change his ways,\Nand I've been giving him advice.

0.5;Will Dad be all right after\Nhaving all that alcohol?!
0.5;You're worried about him,\Naren't you?! I'll get a taxi!
0.5;What are you saying?!\NThat would put him in--
0.5;So when you tried to get\Nhim to turn himself in,
0.5;he pulled out a gun and demanded\Nyour money and credit cards?
0.5;Yes. It seems he planned\Nto skip the country...
0.5;I put my hands up and\Nwalked slowly toward him.
0.5;I jumped at him and tried\Nto snatch the gun away--
0.5;It was just an unfortunate\Naccident, Inspector Megure!
0.5;I don't know his name,\Nbut he said he was a gambling client.
0.5;They had talked about\Nhim getting out of a life of crime!
0.5;That's why he\Ncame alone to meet him!
0.5;That was another mistake.\NI take full responsibility.
0.5;You've probably already\Nseen on TV or in the papers,
0.5;but Matsuyama's victim was\Nindeed a gambling client.
0.5;The murder happened\Naround 8:00, two nights ago,
0.5;That's right. We still don't\Nknow why he didn't use a gun,
0.5;but it looks like a gambling\Ndebt was at the root of it all.
0.5;A formal decision is forthcoming,\Nbut he did go alone
0.5;and allowed Matsuyama to die,\Naccident or not...
0.5;Which means nobody doubts\NTeraoka-san's testimony...
0.5;Oh, there is one thing\Nwe've kept from the media--
0.5;we found three sets of\Nfingerprints on the gun.
0.5;One is Matsuyama's,\Nand another is Inspector Teraoka's.
0.5;but we don't know who\Nthe others belong to.
0.5;Maybe from someone\Nin Matsuyama's gang?
0.5;No. We got all their prints,\Nbut none matched up.
0.5;We've considered that too,\Nbut we don't have any leads.
0.5;Who does the third set belong to?\NIf that gun's owner is who I suspect it is...
0.5;Now that you mention it,\Nhe seemed extremely shocked.
0.5;No doubt about it!\NMatsuyama was shot by Teraoka-san!
0.5;I'd like to discuss\Nyesterday's incident.
0.5;That was weird for Inspector\NMegure to ask me
0.5;to come to Teraoka-senpai's\Nhouse at this hour!
0.5;And me and Conan-kun!\NI wonder if something happened...
0.5;And I called the inspector\Nusing the old man's voice!
0.5;I didn't know the inspector\Nhad called you here too...
0.5;To be honest, I don't know\Nwhy he called us here, either.
0.5;This room is for when\Nwe have guests over.
0.5;You and Ran should come\Nspend the night sometime.
0.5;Smells of oil. Did he use\Nthe inside of this to--
0.5;You're the one who\Nhad something to say...
0.5;What?! You called me and said\Nyou had something to say!
0.5;Very well. Let us forget the\Ndetails and get down to business.
0.5;But first, please have a\Nseat, madam. You too, Ran.
0.5;Teraoka-senpai. You killed\NMatsuyama, didn't you?
0.5;I never expected you to say that!\NI see you haven't changed one bit!
0.5;When you met Matsuyama,\Nyou hit him with a knockout blow,
0.5;put the gun in his hand, aimed it\Nat his chest, and pulled the trigger.
0.5;Ridiculous! What kind\Nof joke is this, Mori?
0.5;First, when you invited\Nus to the BBQ yesterday,
0.5;you didn't take even\Na single sip of beer.
0.5;Yes. Just as you said,\Neven off-duty officers don't know
0.5;So you refrained from drinking.\NI thought so, too.
0.5;However, you were very\Nintent on checking the time.
0.5;Perhaps because you knew when\NMatsuyama would call you?
0.5;That's why you left your phone\Non your belt and didn't drink.
0.5;I always have my phone on me!\NIn case I get an emergency call!
0.5;It's in my room now,\Nbut normally it's--
0.5;Next, when you spoke with\NMatsuyama on the phone,
0.5;you whispered at first but\Nthen started to shout!
0.5;Where are you?! Alright!\NI'll be right there!
0.5;Almost as if to let us hear\Nwhat was being discussed.
0.5;Then, even though you were in\Na hurry, when I asked you about it,
0.5;you purposely stopped and\Nexplained the call in great detail.
0.5;Apparently, he accidentally\Nkilled someone last night.
0.5;I think he really called you about\Nhis murder the night before.
0.5;One was to call you at\N12:00 the following day.
0.5;The caller had\Nprobably hung up by then.
0.5;Then, anticipating I would\Nsuggest going together,
0.5;he said he would\Nmeet Matsuyama alone.
0.5;So that I would vouch\Nthat you met him unarmed.
0.5;That's why you needed me\Nnear you when he called.
0.5;He suddenly decided\Nlast night and all...
0.5;"At 9:00, he left his room and said,\N""I'm bringing Mori over tomorrow!"""
0.5;In other words,\NI was used as part of your plan.
0.5;when he got out of the car\Nat Kowan Wharf, right?
0.5;He purposely didn't wear his\Njacket to make it seem that way,
0.5;despite having gone through the\Ntrouble of getting it before leaving.
0.5;That's why he ardently refused when\Nhis wife offered to get his jacket.
0.5;No, there is proof. The third\Nset of fingerprints on the gun.
0.5;your wife looked uneasily\Nup at the upstairs room.
0.5;because you were going to\Nmeet Matsuyama without a gun.
0.5;She was worried because you\Nwere going to meet him with a gun.
0.5;In other words, she knew you\Nhad a gun hidden in your room!
0.5;Most likely, she found\Nyour gun by accident

0.5;Would you care to explain your\Nmotive for killing Matsuyama?
0.5;--paying me off. I leaked police\Ninfo to him in exchange for money.

0.5;I told him I'd have the money\Nthe next day and to call me at 12:00.

0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Could you explain the events leading \Nup to you discovering the body?
0.5;This morning as I was going out, my \Nhusband asked me to do something.
0.5;Some work documents should \Narrive before noon.
0.5;I took the documents that were delivered \Nand left home at exactly 12.
0.5;I called to say I was on my way, \Nbut he didn't answer his phone.
0.5;I thought he might be feeling unwell, so \NI had the doorman unlock the door for me.
0.5;She arrived around 12:20 and discovered \Nthe body immediately after that.
0.5;I think he was wearing leather \Nshoes when I saw him this morning.
0.5;He probably scraped his face \Non the ground when he fell.
0.5;Then shouldn't there be \Ngrit stuck to his face?
0.5;Either way, the autopsy \Nmight reveal something.
0.5;And I'm sure an investigation of \NKanbayashi's office will turn up something.
0.5;Yes. We didn't have much \Nmoney when we got married.
0.5;We could barely afford those fox \Nand raccoon dog stuffed animals.
0.5;Was Kanbayashi behaving \Nstrangely this morning?
0.5;He only stepped out for five \Nminutes to buy cigarettes.
0.5;Yes. I have my wife to thank \Nfor the man I am today.
0.5;It doesn't sound like there \Nwas trouble between them.
0.5;your husband must have been working on \Nsomething when he accidentally fell.
0.5;Someone cornered Kanbayashi-san \Nby the window and pushed him.
0.5;Even if someone snuck in, the only way in\Nwas the service entrance, and I was there.
0.5;Perhaps he had writer's block \Nand did it impulsively.
0.5;He was suffering so much, \Nbut I didn't notice.
0.5;You do sometimes hear about writers \Ndoing that when they can't write.
0.5;But if he did it on impulse, wouldn't he have \Njumped from here instead of the hallway window?
0.5;I came by to see how the manuscript was \Ncoming along, and they told me he's dead.
0.5;I know this is a bad time, but I need to \Nfigure out how to handle the situation,
0.5;That's a receipt from a \Nnearby convenience store.
0.5;He bought gloves and a carton \Nof cigarettes this morning.
0.5;But Kanbayashi-san went \Nout to buy some, right?
0.5;He would get so focused on \Nwork, he'd forget that he had some.
0.5;His wife wanted a divorce, but the stingy \Nwriter didn't want to pay alimony,
0.5;After growing tired of him, his wife \Nbecame obsessed with Korean celebrities.
0.5;According to my sources, your \Nrelationship ended long ago.
0.5;I sense the key to solving the \Nmystery of his fall lies there.
0.5;It was rocky at times, but we \Npatched up our relationship.
0.5;None of them make sense, and \Nnothing seems quite right.
0.5;And why was Kanbayashi-san \Nstanding in this window?
0.5;As long as you put it back \Nbefore then, it's fine.
0.5;And regardless of when\Nthe documents arrived,
0.5;he knew his wife would\Nleave home after noon.
0.5;Even in the middle of the day, \Nit's dark with the shadows of the trees.
0.5;But he underestimated the two \Nmeter distance and failed.
0.5;The wife said she left home \Nat exactly 12:00, right?
0.5;But a neighbor spotted her \Nleaving earlier at 11:20!
0.5;If she arrived at 11:40, \Nshe could have pushed him!
0.5;But even if she made it here, she couldn't \Nhave gone inside without the doorman noticing.
0.5;She lied about a fact \Nas critical as the time!
0.5;She'll show her true colors \Nif we question her!
0.5;Damn it, there's still one \Nmore thing I don't know!
0.5;I did leave the house \Nat 11:20 the first time.
0.5;I was in a hurry to deliver the \Ndocuments and forgot to lock up.
0.5;Kanbayashi Nagasaku's death is mysterious \Nindeed, but I've finally solved it.
0.5;Kanbayashi Seiko-san, your \Nhusband nearly killed you.
0.5;His motive was probably \Nbecause he met a new woman.
0.5;First he asked you to bring the \Ndocuments to draw you here.
0.5;Normally he had documents delivered here,\Nbut he had them sent to the house instead.
0.5;opened the window in the fifth floor men's \Nbathroom directly opposite the window,
0.5;jump to the bathroom window, \Nexit through the building,
0.5;Once he closed the window in the \Nmen's bathroom, he would be finished.
0.5;After 11, cleaning services\Ndon't come until 5PM,
0.5;so no one would notice\Nif he did it before then.
0.5;and her time of death would be \Ndetermined to be around noon.
0.5;Kanbayashi-san was inside this \Nbuilding from morning until evening.
0.5;He left for about five minutes, but \Nsince it's not enough time to travel
0.5;to and back from the scene of the \Nmurder, he wouldn't be suspected.
0.5;It was another tool to make us\Nbelieve he wasn't trying to kill me.
0.5;It was all a scheme to get \Naway with killing his wife!
0.5;Kanbayashi-san failed to jump across \Nto the window like he planned.
0.5;I had no idea I was such a \Nbother that he wanted to kill me.
0.5;After leaving your home at 11:20, \Nyou arrived here at 11:40.
0.5;You were already suspicious because \Nhe sent the documents to your home,
0.5;so you followed Kanbayashi-san and \Nrealized what he was planning.
0.5;Then you and the doorman \Ndiscovered the body together.
0.5;Without a third party with you, \Nsuspicion would fall on you.
0.5;A wife benefits most from \Nher husband's death.
0.5;I believe you'll find proof in the \Nneighboring building's bathroom.
0.5;We found Kanbayashi-san's eyebrow \Nhairs in the deck brush.
0.5;My idiot husband had been \Ntrying to kill me for a long time.
0.5;All I did was shove the brush \Nin my idiot husband's face.
0.5;They both wanted to kill each other,\Nbut pretended to be happily married.
0.5;Kanbayashi-san's plan failed because \Nyou left home forty minutes early.
0.5;Why didn't you wait until \Nthe end of the episode?
0.5;A way to kill my idiot husband and \Nmake it look like an accident.
0.5;I wanted to put it into \Naction as soon as possible.
0.5;In that case, this is the \Nbirth of detective Funachi!
0.5;Ah, a young girl dreams \Nof finding her lovebird.
0.5;A trap lurks in a\Nbeautiful woman's shadow!
0.5;You can fool old Kogoro,\Nbut there's always only one truth!
0.5;The Case of the Mysterious\NWoman with Amnesia.
0.5;"""Yuda Hitoshi, the murderer\Nwho was arrested"
0.5;thanks to Mori Kogoro's\Nbrilliant detective work,
0.5;Yuda is an extremely\Ncalculating criminal,
0.5;and has many ingenious\Ntechniques at his disposal.
0.5;He murdered his wife Keiko-san to collect\Non her life insurance policy,
0.5;"and was only arrested because of\NMori's incredible detective skills."""
0.5;I'll get you for this someday!\NMark my words, Mori Kogoro!
0.5;We'll be fine, Ran!\NThere's nothing to worry about!
0.5;I'm probably the one he should\Nbe after, not the old man.
0.5;Therefore you killed her, Yuda!\NGive yourself up!
0.5;He's probably fleeing\Nthe country as we speak.
0.5;Give me a break! Why did I have\Nto come here with them?
0.5;What's he looking at?\NHe's not watching the race...
0.5;Damn. I hit you once and\Nall my luck goes down the drain.
0.5;All she can remember about herself\Nis that her name is Maya.
0.5;Technically speaking, it's a light case\Nof retrograde amnesia.
0.5;Maybe it happened when\Nshe fell off those stairs?
0.5;But it could happen tomorrow, in a month,\Nor even three years from now--
0.5;Alright! This calls\Nfor a great detective!
0.5;I, Mori Kogoro,\Nshall restore Maya-san's memory!
0.5;Hey, now. What does a great detective\Nhave to do with that?
0.5;Can you at least remember\Nwhere you lost your memory?
0.5;In your state, you couldn't\Nhave walked very far...
0.5;My deductions tell me that you must\Nhave lost your memory nearby...
0.5;Is there anything\Nyou can almost remember?
0.5;so maybe you were\Non your way home from the gym!
0.5;You certainly are\Nincredibly proportioned!
0.5;Surely you do some kind of sports,\Nlike body-building or weight-lifting!
0.5;What does she do to get\Nthose kinds of scars?
0.5;Say, does your job involve\Nusing wires at all?
0.5;Ow, my head! I can't\Nremember anything else!
0.5;Hey, did you borrow this\Nfrom the lady at the hospital?
0.5;A puzzle piece and a page\Ntorn out of a book...
0.5;See? There are light indentations\Non it that look like writing.
0.5;Ah, she must've written\Non the previous page
0.5;and accidentally tore this page out\Nalong with the other one.
0.5;It might be fastest to have her look\Nat something that identifies herself.
0.5;Where might she unconsciously\Nuse a Bible to jot down some notes?
0.5;I can see her writing in it while on\Nthe phone, then ripping the pages out.
0.5;Say, hotels have Bibles\Nin all their rooms, right?
0.5;Yes! It would have to be\Nfrom at least a 3-star hotel.
0.5;That narrows down the\Nnumber of possible hotels.
0.5;Yeah, Dad! Let's check\Neach hotel one by one!
0.5;I just want to know\Nwho I am and where I'm from!
0.5;I've determined that this is a page\Nfrom a Bible in a high-class hotel!
0.5;Soon I'll know which hotel\Nyou were staying at!
0.5;There'd be no suffering\Nif everything was that easy...
0.5;Do you know if this young woman\Nhas been staying here?
0.5;Tachibana Maya-sama.\NShe checked in two days ago.
0.5;Here, I'll search her things.\NYou two get out of the way.
0.5;There's nothing really here\Nto identify who you are...
0.5;But there's no mistake that\NMaya-san was staying in this room.
0.5;I'm not even sure\Nif that's my real name...
0.5;Why is the man from the racetrack\Nafter Maya-san?!
0.5;What's going on?\NWhat was with that car?!
0.5;Maya-san! There's someone\Nout to get you!
0.5;And the shock of being attacked\Nmust've caused you to lose your memory!
0.5;This area is full of\None-way streets and dead-ends!
0.5;She reacted almost like\Nshe knows when she's in danger.
0.5;Get out of here, little boy.\NIt's dangerous.
0.5;We found her at the crosswalk\Nnear 5th Street three hours ago!
0.5;Maybe she took the bus from\Nthe hotel, got in an accident,
0.5;Then she walked in a daze\Nto the pedestrian bridge.
0.5;But why did she leave after that\Nwithout getting any medical treatment?
0.5;Maybe because that man\Nwas trying to get her?
0.5;Yeah! You might remember\Nwhere you were planning to go
0.5;Don't rush yourself. You've already\Nremembered a lot in one day.
0.5;But with all the people\Ngetting on and off,
0.5;This is it! I was supposed\Nto get off here!
0.5;What the hell? Are you\Ntrying to kill us all?!
0.5;Judging from the timing, he's not\Ntrying to kill her or even all of us!
0.5;If he's out to kill Kogoro,\Nthen he must be--
0.5;Damn it! Thanks to that woman,\Nmy plan's been ruined...
0.5;I wanted to watch him\Nsuffer and die, but no!
0.5;I remember now! That man's\Nhideout is over there!
0.5;Maybe those numbers written\Nin that Bible were an address!
0.5;"So that's what ""Last Supper""\Nreferred to!"
0.5;So that puzzle piece\Nwas part of this picture!
0.5;Yuda's puzzle piece was the key\Nto information about Kogoro!
0.5;In other words, she came here\Nto get it from him...
0.5;How did you find out where\Nhis hideout was, Maya-san?
0.5;Yuda and Maya-san\Nclearly knew each other!
0.5;I'll get you for this someday!\NMark my words!
0.5;If she used a bus instead\Nof a taxi or rental car
0.5;to hide her tracks\Nlike most professionals do,
0.5;She's a professional killer\Nthat Yuda hired to take Kogoro out!
0.5;Your memory returned when Yuda\Ndropped the concrete on us, didn't it?
0.5;That's right! My memory\Ncame back because of him!
0.5;I should've realized when you tried\Nto hide the marks on your hands
0.5;Realized that you were an assassin\Nwho uses piano wire, that is.
0.5;Just figuring out that I use wire\Nfor a living was impressive enough.
0.5;It seems both he and I chose\Nthe wrong target, little detective.
0.5;Oh, she was saying that Mori Kogoro\Nreally is a great detective
0.5;since he captured\Nthe same guy twice in a row!
0.5;Guess that means I'll be raking it in\Nafter this next G1 horse race then!
0.5;Now then, please explain\Nthe situation during the kidnapping.
0.5;I don't want to think\Nabout Naoko being dead!
0.5;Are you sure you haven't garnered\Na lot of hatred in your time?
0.5;I manage this property now.\NIt used to be some kind of research facility.
0.5;No matter how loudly we shout \Nhere, no one will hear us.
0.5;So, have you figured out \Nwho tried to kill me?
0.5;Of course I know who tried \Nto kill you, Azuma-san.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Azuma-san came to my \Noffice yesterday evening
0.5;I'm sure they were just trying \Nto intimidate me, though.
0.5;so I thought I'd ask you to \Ndetermine who called me.
0.5;My wife who was against it died \Nin an accident the other day,
0.5;I didn't do it, but I \Nunderstand how they feel.
0.5;That Azuma bastard stole the \Nland my dad left to me.
0.5;Is it possible your father \Nsold the property to Azuma?
0.5;My father killed himself after Azuma \Ntricked him out of the property
0.5;Murderers always get their \Ncomeuppance eventually.
0.5;It's like they were waiting \Nfor me to be alone.
0.5;Are you saying you can't solve the case without \Nthe police, you incompetent detective?!
0.5;Hurry up and figure out which \Nof the three of them did it!
0.5;I went to the place where \NAzuma was attacked.
0.5;The security camera in the parking \Nlot was undergoing repairs,
0.5;so I couldn't review the \Nmoment of the crime.
0.5;Later I went to your office and spoke \Nwith a clerk named Suematsu-san.
0.5;But Mori-san didn't ask \Nme about those three.
0.5;You can't conduct business without \Ngetting your hands dirty.
0.5;Your beloved sister was unofficially \Noffered a job at a first-class bank.
0.5;Fearing that, you tried to kill \NAzuma, who knew your secret.
0.5;But you just said you couldn't review \Nit because it was undergoing repairs.
0.5;Later I went to a nearby \Nconvenience store
0.5;He's buying the things \NAzuma-san asked him to get.
0.5;The three of them had nothing \Nto do with this case...
0.5;but there was someone \Nwho ordered him to do it.
0.5;If Kasai-san had always \Nplanned to killed Azuma,
0.5;he would've killed him in secret \Ninstead of threatening him.
0.5;In other words, Kasai-san isn't \Nthe one who made the threat.
0.5;But since Kasai-san attempted to \Nkill Azuma, it's natural to assume
0.5;When you consider Kasai-san recommended \Nhiring me to investigate the case,
0.5;Perhaps Kasai-san was \Nthreatened late last night...
0.5;"""I'll expose all the crimes \Nyou've committed."""
0.5;"""If you want to protect \Nyour sister, kill Azuma."""
0.5;When you threatened him last night, you \Nlikely picked it up after Kasai-san dropped it.
0.5;Surely you don't suspect me because \Nwe happen to have the same pen.
0.5;you manipulated Kasai-san and \Nmade the threatening call.
0.5;By making the threat, you directed \Nsuspicion towards yourselves,
0.5;so Kasai-san could kill Azuma during \Nthat resulting opportunity.
0.5;Our goal this time was for you to find \Nthe culprit behind a fake crime.
0.5;Yamanami-san and Kitao-san's \Nstrange behaviors
0.5;also make sense when you realize they \Nwere playing to hidden cameras.
0.5;This job was given to us by \NNichiuri TV's Tomurai-san.
0.5;so this serious performance \Nwas exciting for us.
0.5;But since you suspected \Nwe were up to something,
0.5;The story about filming \Na prank show was a lie.
0.5;We were never filming or \Nrecording in the first place.
0.5;And naturally, I'm not an \Nemployee of Nichiuri TV either.
0.5;I can't have you escaping \Nand calling the police.
0.5;I'd been searching for the \Nperfect place for two months,
0.5;I installed the same detonator on \Nthe dynamite wrapped around you.
0.5;You said you'll execute me, but \Nwhat have I ever done to you?
0.5;You could've surprised me or thrown \Na bomb into my office, but instead
0.5;you went through the trouble of writing \Na script and having me solve a mystery.
0.5;In other words, you don't \Nhate the ordinary Kogoro.
0.5;If not for your meddling detective work, \NUtsubo wouldn't have gone to jail.
0.5;I had to execute you while you \Nwere the Sleeping Kogoro.
0.5;but killing a detective while he's \Nproudly laying out his reasoning
0.5;Kid, if you don't move, I'll \Nblow up that man over there.
0.5;Once she laughs, I'm sure she'll feel \Nstupid about trying to get revenge.
0.5;In that case, there's that thing \Nfor our next performance.
0.5;No matter how much you \Nstall, I won't give up.
0.5;There's nothing I hate \Nmore than sob stories.

0.5;Remember? We've met in\Nthe Poirot shop below my office!
0.5;Yes! Come to think of it, isn't your\Napartment building near here?
0.5;Say, Mori-san! Would you\Nlike to go for a drive?
0.5;I know a place with\Na beautiful night view!
0.5;But it's no fun unless\Nyou go with someone else!
0.5;You can pull the seat back.\NThere's a lever under the seat.
0.5;but I came back to check on\Nmy roommate, who caught a cold.
0.5;Hearing your exploits as a great\Ndetective would be even more useful!
0.5;I'm so glad he had\Nan emergency come up!
0.5;The deceased is Takenaka\NKazumi-san, a 29 year-old attendant.
0.5;Mori-san and her roommate\NShimamura Sachiko-san found her.
0.5;Judging from the rigor mortis\Nof her lower jaw and neck,
0.5;she died approximately two-and-a-half\Nhours ago, around 9:00 pm.
0.5;Mori-kun! What are\Nthose two doing here?!
0.5;I called to let them know,\Nand they came here on their own!
0.5;It connects to the victim's\Nroom via dining room and kitchen.
0.5;She says she might've\Nforgotten to lock it.
0.5;Meaning the killer entered\Nthrough this window?
0.5;But how would they\Nget onto this veranda?
0.5;See! You can jump onto the\Nveranda from the emergency stairs!
0.5;The intruder probably didn't\Nrealize Kazumi-san was sick in bed.
0.5;So, during a search for\Nthings of value in the kitchen,
0.5;and the thief stabbed\Nher out of surprise!
0.5;And then the intruder\Nescaped through the front door.
0.5;In other words,\Nit was a robbery-murder!
0.5;I'm sorry to ask, but\Nwhere were you at around 9:00?
0.5;At that time, I was\Ntaking a drive with Mori-san.
0.5;But, Dad! Weren't you\Nmeeting a friend tonight?
0.5;I did meet him, but something\Ncame up so we ended early.
0.5;So I returned to Beika Station,\Nstrolled around 2nd Street to sober up,
0.5;and then ran into Sachiko-san\Nbehind Beika Middle School,
0.5;Right at 8:00.\NThen we both went for a drive.
0.5;She knew a nice spot with\Na good view of the Toto Bay Bridge,
0.5;while we drank beer and juice\Nshe bought from a vending machine,
0.5;We stopped by her office\Nfor about five minutes,
0.5;That's when we found\Nthe body and contacted you.
0.5;Still, what were you doing\Nbehind Beika Middle School?
0.5;I run a small import\Ncompany on Akebono Street.
0.5;But I was worried about Kazumi,\Nsince she was in bed with a cold,
0.5;so I left her alone and\Nwent straight back to my car.
0.5;Say. Why did you park your\Ncar behind the middle school?
0.5;Why didn't you use the\Napartment building's parking lot?
0.5;Our parking lot is a two-level,\Ntop-bottom type, so it's a pain to use.
0.5;And I planned to\Nreturn to my office right after.
0.5;Then couldn't you park in\Nfront of the apartment building?
0.5;I would have gotten in the way\Nof the buses that pass by the front.
0.5;Was it here when you came\Nto check on Kazumi-san?
0.5;Understood. We'll check with\Nthe delivery people tomorrow.
0.5;Not that. The reason Sachiko-san\Nparked her car behind Beika Middle School.
0.5;What did you talk\Nabout for an hour and a half
0.5;And why did you go\Non a drive with her, anyway?!
0.5;W-What are you trying to say?!\NI didn't do anything improper!
0.5;I don't remember everything we said!\NBesides, halfway through--
0.5;The truth is, we only\Nchatted for the first half hour.
0.5;Yeah. Drunkenness started\Nto set in while I had those beers.
0.5;That's so funny!\NYou fell asleep during a date!
0.5;But he was awake\Nuntil 9:00, chatting with her.
0.5;The murder took place\Naround 9:00. Her alibi is airtight.
0.5;Hey. You forgot your\Nwatch yesterday, right?
0.5;There was a clock in the bar,\Nand I saw a clock at Shibahama Station.
0.5;It's fifteen minutes from Shibahama\NStation to Beika Station.
0.5;It's ten minutes by foot from\NBeika Station to Beika Middle School.
0.5;Which means you ran\Ninto Sachiko-san at around...
0.5;Now eat your damn\Nfood and go to school!
0.5;He's right.\NI should just forget about it.
0.5;Three laps around the\Nschoolyard is really exhausting!
0.5;Just a little more!\NHang in there, Genta!
0.5;Alright! I'm gonna\Nhave boxed eel lunch tonight!
0.5;Boxed eel lunch!\NBoxed eel lunch! Tonight--
0.5;Oh no. He's too busy thinking\Nabout boxed eel lunches.
0.5;Could you have fallen asleep\Nafter you got on at Shibahama Station?
0.5;A trip around the\NLoop Line takes an hour!
0.5;If you had gone around\Nit once while you were asleep,
0.5;you would've reached Beika\NStation at 8:40 instead of 7:40!
0.5;Nonsense! I only slept for fifteen minutes!\NI couldn't have looped around!
0.5;In the same train and train car\Nleaving Shibahama Station at 7:30!
0.5;Let's just take a\Nfull trip around. Okay?
0.5;This is the furthest\Nstop from Shibahama Station.
0.5;He was sleeping with\Nhis mouth wide open yesterday...
0.5;Which means I arrived at\NBeika Station just before 9:00!
0.5;Yes! You arrived at the Toto\NBay Bridge view point at 9:30!
0.5;Then you chatted for\Nthirty minutes, until 10:00!
0.5;In other words, she turned\Nthe clock back an hour
0.5;Last night, she parked her\Ncar in this out-of-the-way location
0.5;She entered through the window\Nshe had unlocked in advance,
0.5;then killed the awoken victim to\Nmake it look like a robbery-murder.
0.5;After that, she returned\Nhere and ran into you.
0.5;Were they the bloodied clothes\Nand gloves she used in the murder?!
0.5;If so, then she disposed of\Nthem at the view point while you slept.
0.5;She set the car clock an\Nhour ahead before you got in.
0.5;Then, while you were asleep,\Nshe put it back to normal.
0.5;Damn it! How dare she\Ntoy with the great Mori Kogoro?!
0.5;You met Mori-kun behind\NBeika Middle School just after the crime.
0.5;But isn't it possible the\Nchildren mistook Mori-san
0.5;Even if by some chance\Nmy alibi doesn't check out,
0.5;that doesn't mean\Nthat I killed Kazumi-san.
0.5;Oh, geez! Do I have\Nto do it after all?!
0.5;Let us go back to\N8:30 pm two nights ago.
0.5;A deliveryman knocked on the door,\Nand Kazumi-san answered it.
0.5;she decided to sign for it\Nwith a pen in the dining room.
0.5;Supposedly, the deliveryman\Nsaid it might be the ink,
0.5;so he took the\Npen and looked inside.
0.5;Some ink was still left, and when\Nshe tried to write again, it worked.
0.5;When the deliveryman left,\NKazumi-san placed the pen by the phone
0.5;Seeing your own\Npen lying next to her body
0.5;right after you killed her,\Nyou instinctually picked it up and...
0.5;When you did,\Nthe pen in your pocket fell out.
0.5;You didn't seem to notice, but after\NI got into the passenger seat,
0.5;I assume you can guess\Nwhat happened next.
0.5;What I picked up was\Nyour pen instead of mine!
0.5;We found the fingerprints\Nof you and Mori-kun on this pen.
0.5;In addition, the fingerprints of\Nthe deliveryman were on the ink stick.
0.5;These fingerprints mean you\Nentered the apartment after 8:30!
0.5;One year ago, I unknowingly\Nimported and sold outlawed goods.
0.5;Kazumi knew this, and demanded\NI pay her a set amount each month.
0.5;She threatened to tell the banks\Nand cut off my financing if I said no,
0.5;But when I considered being\Nblackmailed for the rest of my life...
0.5;When Mori-san called out to me,\NI thought I was already done for.
0.5;But I realized he thought it was\Nan hour earlier than it really was
0.5;But what did you plan to do\Nfor an alibi if he hadn't shown up?
0.5;I set a video camera\Nin my office window
0.5;I planned to tell the police it\Nwas one of the customers leaving
0.5;You could've killed him after he\Nfell asleep at the view point, right?
0.5;I don't hold anything\Nagainst Mori-san, after all.
0.5;Come to think of it, you're always\Nwearing glasses, Conan-kun.
0.5;Even when sleeping\Nor taking a bath. Why?

0.5;On our way home, a homicide \Noccurred on a lower floor.
0.5;M-Maybe it has something\Nto do with that fax.
0.5;It said we'd regret it if we \Ndidn't fire his assistant.
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;The contents of the novel \Nbring us closer to the case.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;The Romance Novel with the \NUnexpected Conclusion, Part Two!
0.5;There's something I wanted \Nto confirm with you.
0.5;The caps for the shampoo and \Nconditioner are missing?
0.5;They're amenities that \Ncome with the bathroom.
0.5;Then you weren't the ones \Nwho knocked over the table?
0.5;Most of the room was undisturbed, but \Nsomehow just the table was knocked over.
0.5;A can of beer that we believe \Nwas sitting on top of it
0.5;The victim's clothes inside the \Nsuitcase are covered in beer.
0.5;In addition to clothes, we found \Nmakeup, a tablet, and a backpack.
0.5;There was an old postcard in one of \Nthe backpack's inside pockets, too.
0.5;"When I write a story like this, maybe \NI'll name the heroine after you."""
0.5;But it's addressed to Ota \NJun, not Mizunashi Chiaki.
0.5;"That's the heroine's name from Hiura-sensei's\N""The Phone, the Ocean, and I."""
0.5;One day, the heroine finds an old \Nscratched up cell phone on the beach.
0.5;the phone is a new, unreleased model she\Nwas planning to buy the following week.
0.5;While she's looking at the phone, she \Nreceives an e-mail asking how old she is.
0.5;"the heroine responds, ""I won't tell \Nyou my personal information, idiot!"""
0.5;"She receives the response ""You started \Ntalking like that in high school."
0.5;The sender correctly guesses \Na bunch of other things, too,
0.5;like the results of that day's\Nsoccer or baseball games.
0.5;When the heroine learns the world becomes \Na mess a few years in the future,
0.5;she begins changing the future \Nlittle by little to prevent it.
0.5;"""Who are you? What is your \Nrelationship with me?"""
0.5;"But they always answer \N""The phone, the ocean, and I."""
0.5;Huh? What the heck? \NWhat does that mean?
0.5;The heroine thought it was gibberish at \Nfirst, but she finally figured it out recently.
0.5;"She responds to the sender with \N""The phone, the ocean, and I."""
0.5;The answer is finally going to be \Nrevealed in next week's final chapter.
0.5;but he invited the editors watching him \Ninto his room for lunch to win them over.
0.5;I would probably shave my head in \Ndesperation and ask for more time.
0.5;we're having him wait in front of his \Nroom until forensics is finished.
0.5;How long are you going to \Nkeep searching my room?
0.5;The body was found in her\Nroom directly below this one,
0.5;I was in this room at that time, and \NI even have people vouching for me!
0.5;From 3:00 until around 4:30, \NI was eating in Hiura-sensei's room.
0.5;He was taking a bath at the \Ntime and didn't eat with us,
0.5;but there's no way he could \Nhave gotten out of this room.
0.5;We were eating at the \Ntable facing the entrance.
0.5;But if he had a rope, he could climb \Ndown from the balcony to the room below.
0.5;A simple author like myself \Ncould never pull that off.
0.5;Besides, you can see the \Nbalcony from the table, too.
0.5;If you want to take any \Nmore of my personal time,
0.5;when the crime was committed \Nand how I got back up.
0.5;You invited the victim to this \Nroom and killed her here.
0.5;The editors would have noticed \NMinazuki-kun coming to this room!
0.5;There were lots of people \Nbringing delivery food, right?
0.5;I think anyone would be \Nfooled if Minazuki-san
0.5;M-Maybe, but everyone\Nleft once we paid them.
0.5;Then what about the wine\Non top of that desk?
0.5;it wouldn't be strange for the delivery \Nperson to enter the room, right?
0.5;Hiura-sensei asked the person who delivered \Nthe wine to pour it into a decanter.
0.5;It was a bellhop wearing glasses \Nwith her hair tied back.
0.5;you would've checked how many people \Nentered and how many left, right?
0.5;Hiura-sensei may have tried to escape \Ndisguised as a delivery person.
0.5;But once he invited you into the room, \Nyou stopped checking as diligently.
0.5;No matter who entered, you just had\Nto make sure Hiura-sensei didn't leave.
0.5;That's why it didn't bother you that\Nthe bellhop who brought the wine
0.5;While the editors were \Neating in the living room,
0.5;he told the victim to go to the \Nbathroom and killed her there.
0.5;The body was wearing a bathrobe which \Nwould be easy to put on someone.
0.5;B-But why did the victim \Ndisguise herself as a bellhop?
0.5;She's his assistant. She could have \Nstopped by without hesitation.
0.5;If the editors saw her enter, who knows\Nwhat the magazines would write next?
0.5;I'd like to use it if I ever\Nwrite a mystery novel.
0.5;How did I move the body from \Nthis room to the one below?
0.5;thirty minutes before the bellboy \Ndiscovered the body downstairs.
0.5;What were you doing between the time I \Nleft and the bellboy started shouting?
0.5;I-I was reading the manuscript you \Nhad written in front of your room.
0.5;Something just fell on the \Nbalcony from the floor above.
0.5;of a suitcase containing the \Nbody and lowering it is easy.
0.5;You can swing the suitcase \Nonto the balcony below.
0.5;If you don't tie the rope to the handle,\Nyou can pull it back up by one of the ends.
0.5;Which means the suitcase \Nin the victim's room...
0.5;The backpack inside the suitcase \Nwas probably her actual luggage.
0.5;He removed the contents and \Nstuffed her inside the suitcase.
0.5;Hiura-sensei strangled the victim in the\Nbathroom after inviting her to his room,
0.5;stuffed her inside the suitcase naked, \Nwaited for the editors to finish and leave,
0.5;and lowered the suitcase containing her \Nbody to the room below from the balcony.
0.5;Then he handed out the finished \Nmanuscripts to the waiting editors,
0.5;and said he would think about how to finish \Nhis book while buying cigarettes around 5:30.
0.5;He entered the victim's room using \Nthe room key he stole from her,
0.5;dressed her in a bathrobe, and \Nplaced her body near the entrance.
0.5;The bellboy instructed\Nto deliver champagne
0.5;to her room at exactly 6:00 \Ndiscovered her body for him.
0.5;He hastily stuffed the body inside the \Nsuitcase before her hair had dried.
0.5;It was probably wet and\Nsmelled like shampoo.
0.5;Why didn't he dry her hair before \Nputting her inside the suitcase?
0.5;The editors would've thought it strange \Nif they heard the sound of the hair dryer.
0.5;Hiura-sensei took the caps off the bottles\Nin the victim's room for the same reason.
0.5;You had to replace the caps the victim\Nwashed down the drain after she used yours.
0.5;Assuming you didn't throw \Nthem away on your way here.
0.5;a bellhop uniform was \Nfound inside a paper bag
0.5;in the garbage can in the elevator \Nhall on the floor below.
0.5;and threw them away before \Nthe body was discovered.
0.5;and fingerprints from the victim and \NHiura-san on the bellhop uniform.
0.5;I tried to get away with it by\Nsending the threatening fax,
0.5;She was a talented assistant. \NYou said she had revived your career!
0.5;Was she actually your lover and \Ndemanding you get divorced?
0.5;She took a bath because \NI told her she smelled.
0.5;"the final scene of ""The \NPhone, the Ocean, and I."""
0.5;While cleaning, I discovered an old fan \Nletter from a grade school student.
0.5;I decided to write a novel \Nbased on the included story,
0.5;using Ota Jun, the name of the \Nsender, as the name of my heroine.
0.5;She made the novel \Nspectacular, but I didn't
0.5;Then a weekly magazine \Naccused us of being lovers.
0.5;This woman intended to steal my family, \Nmy status, my honor, and my money from me
0.5;I used to be quite the \Nplayboy when I was younger.
0.5;I must have done something \Nto make her hate me.
0.5;I killed her before I could \Nask her what it meant.
0.5;"If you translate the words \N""telephone,"" ""sea,"""
0.5;"and ""I"" into English \Nand read them backwards,"
0.5;Maybe the heroine's boyfriend or \Nhusband was sending her messages
0.5;Th-There's no way a child's \Nexplanation could be...
0.5;After all, it was a child who \Noriginally came up with the code.
0.5;"""minazuki"" is another word for \Nthe sixth month, or ""June""."
0.5;"Once you learned the meaning of \N""The Phone, the Ocean, and I,"""
0.5;Maybe she just wanted you to make \Nher childhood dream come true
0.5;Her boyfriend was sending her \Nmessages from the future.
0.5;Based on the size of its battery, \Nit probably doesn't last long.
0.5;but if he tires of waiting and \Nasks you about me, tell him this.
0.5;You wish to challenge the \Ngreat detective Mouri Kogoro?

0.5;his secretary Hosogai, and \Nher fiancé Ehara arrived,
0.5;Even heaven is watching the \Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills \Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;Armed robbery is followed by a \Nkidnapping at the hot springs.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""The Descent Into Hell Tour \Nof Love, Oita Chapter!"""
0.5;Mori-san, what kidnapping \Nare you talking about?
0.5;Manami-san, the daughter of \NNakadai Electric's president,
0.5;It was a Nakadai Electric's vehicle that \Nwas attacked in the armed robbery, too.
0.5;The culprit seemed to know \Nthere was cash in the car.
0.5;But the sudden impact warped the car \Nso the hatchback couldn't be opened.
0.5;Sato-san, don't do anything \Nuntil I get there!
0.5;I stuck a transmitter on \Nthe bottom of the bag.
0.5;Hiroyuki and I will split the 100 \Nmillion 50 million each there.
0.5;Apparently he has a grudge \Nagainst Nakadai Electric.
0.5;He was laid off after they brought in \Ndrones for deliveries and security.
0.5;Her driving technique is \Nas incredible as ever.
0.5;We need to find the bag \Nwith the ransom money.
0.5;Which means she probably left a \Nnote in her room at the inn, too.
0.5;How could she have left a \Nnote when she was kidnapped?
0.5;But when I saw the news \Nthat you were engaged,
0.5;those six months passed \Nin the blink of an eye.
0.5;But I was determined to finish \Nin time for our anniversary.
0.5;We're going to escort \NOgikubo to the Oita police.
0.5;The culprit behind this case \Nattempted to steal 100 million yen
0.5;However, because of the accident \Nhe was unable to steal the money.
0.5;First he had him attack the \Ntransport vehicle, but he failed.
0.5;Next he made up the fake \Nkidnapping of Manami-san,
0.5;Your reasoning is surprisingly \Non point today.
0.5;did Manami-san ever discuss \Nher concerns with you
0.5;Are you sure you didn't \Nwant to marry Manami-san
0.5;So you plotted to use Hiroyuki-san's \Nname to incite a kidnapping,
0.5;and destroy her relationship \Nwith the real Hiroyuki-san—
0.5;and a man named Hiroyuki \Nwho was working with him.
0.5;The drone he used was equipped \Nwith a camera and mic.
0.5;"and the ""horns"" formed by \Ntheir reflection of the drone."
0.5;Because the sound of the \Nwaterfall is so loud there,
0.5;That's why there weren't any \Nfootprints left outside the window.
0.5;received instructions from Hiroyuki \Nto take the note she left
0.5;Wasn't that because her \Nfiancé Ehara-kun was coming?
0.5;Manami-san couldn't have \Nknown Ehara-san was coming.
0.5;You put on the new shoes \Nbecause you were meeting
0.5;I only agreed to it because you interfered \Nwith my relationship with Hiroyuki.
0.5;A man very familiar with Manami-san \Nand Hiroyuki-san's relationship.
0.5;A man capable of predicting \NManami-san's actions,
0.5;the route of the 100 million \Nyen transport three weeks ago.
0.5;Since you planned to split \Nthe money with Ogikubo,
0.5;Was it to hide the company \Nmoney you embezzled?
0.5;It wasn't Hosogai-san who \Nstole the 100 million yen.
0.5;to use this incident to \Nswipe the 100 million.
0.5;your business has been \Ndoing worse, hasn't it?
0.5;because you were after \NNakadai-san's wealth.
0.5;a fashionable man like you was \Non his way to meet his fiancée.
0.5;in clothes you already \Nwore in a men's magazine?
0.5;And you weren't wearing your several \Nmillion yen watch today either.
0.5;Are you sure you didn't sell it \Nbecause you're short on cash?
0.5;While you were waiting in the rest \Narea with the ransom money...
0.5;If we search underneath the \Nshelves at the rest area,
0.5;Conan, you marked the bills \Nwith a highlighter, didn't you?
0.5;A beer after a solved case \Nsure does taste great.
0.5;I thought I heard something fall \Nwhen I picked up the shoehorn.
0.5;I'm sure you can put it \Nback together with glue.
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shooting comet!
0.5;Conan's logic works great on\Nhearts tired by modern society!
0.5;Today's case is Shinigami\NJinnai and his devious crime!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;Does he usually fall asleep\Nin the first five minutes?!
0.5;We were lucky to see an early\Nscreening and you fall asleep!
0.5;I couldn't help it!\NI was up all night working!
0.5;Well, I guess this\Nseries is getting stale...
0.5;It's Shinigami Jinnai's actor,\NNanjo Hayato!
0.5;Aren't you the famous \NMori Kogoro-san?
0.5;Yes, I'm Mori Kogoro,\Nthe great detective!
0.5;Nice to meet you!\NThat was a great movie!
0.5;There's something I'd\Nlike to talk to you about...
0.5;But, Nanjo-san! Your wife\Nis this worried about you...
0.5;Even if the letter is real,\NI'll protect myself!
0.5;Yoshino-kun.\NYou can leave for today, too.
0.5;Behind me is the\Noffice of Nanjo Hayato,
0.5;who has received a death\Nthreat from Shinigami Jinnai.
0.5;Will Shinigami Jinnai\Nappear as warned?
0.5;The famous Mori Kogoro-san\Nis also present,
0.5;It's obvious that Nanjo did\Nthis just to promote the movie!
0.5;Huh? Isn't that Satomi-san,\Nhis manager?
0.5;So Nanjo-san's the\Nonly one here this late...
0.5;The culprit's still on the 7th floor!\NI just saw his shadow!
0.5;So the killer disappeared\Nfrom the scene, Mori-kun?
0.5;The windows are all\Nlocked from the inside,
0.5;and the elevator and the stairs\Nare the only way off the 7th floor.
0.5;And you're certain\Nthat nobody left the building?
0.5;The emergency stairs here meet\Nup with the 1st-floor elevator
0.5;I watched the emergency stairs,\Nbut nobody used them.
0.5;So the killer just\Ndisappeared like smoke...
0.5;Why did the killer turn the lights\Non after murdering Nanjo-san?
0.5;Why on earth did the killer\Nleave this vinyl tape behind?
0.5;Most likely so we would\Ntrip and get tangled up in it,
0.5;But you're the only\None who tripped on it!
0.5;10:03 pm. Just before\Nhe was murdered...
0.5;Just about the time Shinigami\NJinnai appeared in the park...
0.5;Nanjo-san was waiting\Nfor it to arrive tonight.
0.5;Inspector! This shady\Ncharacter was lurking about!
0.5;I returned from the bathroom\Nto find everyone gone,
0.5;So it was you\Nwho killed my husband!
0.5;Come to think of it, you're\Nthe only one without an alibi!
0.5;Until the accident three years ago during\Nthe filming of Shinigami Jinnai...
0.5;We have no choice.\NWe'll do it without him.
0.5;Kitano-kun had agreed, so filming\Nbegan upon Nanjo's insistence.
0.5;I took full responsibility\Nand gave up the director's chair.
0.5;But there's someone who resented\Nhim much more right there!
0.5;I worked for the same agency\Nas a 2nd-rate action movie actress.
0.5;Yes, it was a terrible accident!\NBut I don't blame Nanjo-san for it!
0.5;Satomi-san was out front with\Nus when Nanjo-san was killed!
0.5;Oh yeah! I caught Shinigami\NJinnai on tape in the park!
0.5;Come to think of it, why did\Nthe killer show himself in the park?
0.5;The same with the window locks--\Nthere must be some reason!
0.5;And when you got off the elevator,\Nthe emergency exit was open.
0.5;Then Shinigami Jinnai came\Nout of the office, fired, and ran off?
0.5;That's odd. It's exactly one\Nhour since Nanjo-san was killed.
0.5;Did he hide in the building and\Navoid police detection the whole time?
0.5;Satomi-san was alone.\NRunning off would've been far safer
0.5;We finished examining\Nthe murder scene.
0.5;No. It probably flew outside\Nthrough the emergency exit.
0.5;In which case,\Nfinding it will be difficult.
0.5;You shouldn't touch\Nother people's things.
0.5;Aha! I've figured out\Nthe killer's trick!
0.5;No question about it!\NThat person is the killer!
0.5;But Conan-kun and the others\Nsaw the killer in the window!
0.5;I'll demonstrate it for you.\NHave everyone come back upstairs.
0.5;Please bring some vinyl\Ntape and fishing line as well.
0.5;the killer cut the lights\Nand placed the vinyl tape
0.5;on the window in a zigzag manner\Nto create the shape of a person.
0.5;Next, he affixed the\Nfishing line to the area
0.5;between the elevator\Nand the outer door.
0.5;He then wrapped the line around\Nthe light switch in the office,
0.5;and tied the end to\Nthe tape roll on the window.
0.5;All that remained was for\Nsomeone to call the elevator down...
0.5;The tape came undone\Nwhen the line was pulled,
0.5;making it look like\Nthe person was crouching.
0.5;When pulled far enough, the tape\Nroll caught on the elevator,
0.5;and then the line snapped,\Nleaving the roll behind.
0.5;Yes. The killer shot Nanjo-san\Nwith a silencer-equipped gun,
0.5;set up the elevator trick,\Ntook the stairs to the 6th floor,
0.5;and put a tape with a\Ngunshot on it in the stereo.
0.5;There'd be no way to make\Ncertain the gunshot was heard below...
0.5;and used that time to appear\Nin the park as Shinigami Jinnai
0.5;Hold on a second!\NDoes that mean the killer is--
0.5;Yes! The only one capable\Nof pulling off this trick...
0.5;The second gunshot\Nwasn't meant to happen.
0.5;Yoshino-san didn't realize the\Nstereo was set on auto-rewind.
0.5;As it was a 60-minute tape, the same\Ngunshot rang out one hour later!
0.5;When you went\Ndownstairs to set up the VCR,
0.5;Surprised, you quickly hid\Nthe tape and came up with a lie.
0.5;One of the pages\Nshould have bloodstains on it.
0.5;That fax came in just as\Nthe murder was taking place.
0.5;is the real time \NNanjo-san was murdered.
0.5;There should be a gunshot\Non that tape you took from Conan.
0.5;To get revenge on him for\Nkilling Hiroyuki three years ago!
0.5;there was talk of him replacing\NNanjo as Shinigami Jinnai!
0.5;I joined Nanjo's agency as a manager\Nto learn the truth about his death!
0.5;And then a month ago,\NNanjo got drunk and divulged everything!
0.5;Hey, Yoshino. Remember\Nthat kid who died three years ago
0.5;I lied to the stuntman\Nso he wouldn't come that day.
0.5;The kid was a beginner but\Nthought he could steal my role!
0.5;A bolt that keeps a\Ncar's front wheels in place.
0.5;That's right! He didn't wait\Nfor an accident to happen!
0.5;I wrote the letter to\Nuse the media as an alibi.
0.5;When I advised using it to promote\Nthe movie, Nanjo readily agreed.
0.5;Shinigami Jinnai versus\NDetective Mori Kogoro.
0.5;Looks like Shinigami\NJinnai lost completely.
0.5;"The word ""unsolvable""\Nisn't in Mori Kogoro's dictionary!"
0.5;And who do you\Nhave to thank for that?
0.5;Darn it! We'll just\Nhave to bust it down!
0.5;The one behind this manipulated\Nthe victim in this empty office
0.5;That attitude is the reason people \Nstopped coming to pick tangerines.
0.5;So this is what he meant when he \Nsaid we were his only visitors.
0.5;My father can get nasty when \Nit comes to tangerines.
0.5;I just haven't seen my mom in \Nsuch a good mood in a long time.
0.5;Inscribing love and cases \Nwith deductive reasoning!
0.5;The aroma of citrus fruit drifts through \Ntangerine fields in perfect picnic weather!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Do we have to hike down the \Nmountain carrying these?
0.5;An agricultural monorail \Nfor transporting crops.
0.5;Yeah. It automatically goes up and down \Nthe mountain when you activate the lever.
0.5;it automatically switches into \Nreverse and returns to the shed
0.5;Of course, it can be \Noperated manually as well.
0.5;Thanks to this thing, transporting \Ncrops has become much easier.
0.5;In that case, have some \Nof more of this and that.
0.5;He's happy because you \Ncomplimented his tangerines.
0.5;Hey, you'd better not be saying \Nthings you shouldn't again.
0.5;Then all the more reason for \Nus to discuss this as a family.
0.5;That's when we first started \Nthe tangerine farm together.
0.5;This is when Naoya told me he'd \Nwork on the tangerine farm.
0.5;It's like your family's \Nhistory. It's truly wonderful.
0.5;I was watching from below, and \Nit looked like my dad fell.
0.5;The deceased is Terauchi Tetsuji-san, \Nthe manager of this tangerine farm.
0.5;Most likely, he hit his head \Non a rock when he fell.
0.5;Come to think of it, how did \Nyou notice Tetsuji-san fell?
0.5;I was making repairs near \Nthe sprinkler control panel.
0.5;Would it be natural to think \NTetsuji-san lost his balance
0.5;when he let go of the monorail to \Nwave to Ran-san and her friends?
0.5;But why was Tetsuji-san \Nheading towards the peak?
0.5;I told Ran-san and her friends \Nto go watch the sunset.
0.5;Since it'd be dark by the time they \Nreturned, I asked him to go get them.
0.5;Hey, it seems like there's \Nblood on the inside of his hat,
0.5;Tetsuji-san died when he hit \Nhis head on a rock, right?
0.5;Then normally wouldn't the rock have \Nleft a mark on the outside of the hat?
0.5;Maybe Tetsuji-san lost his hat \Nbefore he hit his head on the rock.
0.5;Then when did the blood get \Non the inside of the hat?
0.5;So where is the monorail \Nyour husband was riding?
0.5;It should be at the shed at \Nthe foot of the mountain.
0.5;Then let's have the others hold things \Ndown here while we go check that out.
0.5;There's nothing particularly \Nsuspicious about the incident,
0.5;It's our fault for calling \Nout to him and waving.
0.5;He shouldn't have let go of the \Nrailing while riding the monorail.
0.5;It's my dad's fault for \Nnot following the rules.
0.5;It's safe to assume this incident \Nwas an unfortunate accident.
0.5;You're always such a tedious \Nman, Inspector Megure.
0.5;There's something that \NI just don't understand.
0.5;I think he raised his hand high \Ninto the air and waved back at us.
0.5;Someone like that couldn't \Nraise their hand high up.
0.5;Is it true that your husband \Nhad a frozen shoulder?
0.5;Tetsuji-san was probably \Nforced to wave his hand
0.5;That person was probably hiding \Nin the bed of the monorail.
0.5;Detective Takagi, there are footprints on \Nthe front of the monorail bed, correct?
0.5;Judging by the footprints, \Nthey belonged to Tetsuji-san.
0.5;Could you place your feet in \Nthem and try sitting on the bed?
0.5;How was he able to sit with \Nhis feet in this position?
0.5;Perhaps there was an additional \Nrow of containers there
0.5;Even so, I don't think an adult \Ncould hide inside these containers.
0.5;The bottoms and sides of those \Ncontainers can be adjusted.
0.5;If you fold the bottoms, three \Ncontainers can be merged into one,
0.5;creating a space large enough \Nfor a person to hide inside.
0.5;Furthermore, if you leave the right \Nside that we couldn't see open,
0.5;Several similar containers were \Nscattered around the tangerine fields.
0.5;the culprit hid inside the folded \Ncontainers and pushed Tetsuji-san,
0.5;then used the monorail's \Nautomatic return system
0.5;to pass before us and return \Nto the foot of the mountain.
0.5;and pretended they saw Tetsuji-san \Nfall when they ran to the crime scene.
0.5;and pushed him so it would \Nlook like an accident.
0.5;I hid the hammer I used to strike \Nmy husband under the workbench.
0.5;If you examine the fingerprints on the \Nhammer, it should prove that I'm the culprit.
0.5;he accrued fooling around \Nwith other women.
0.5;We wouldn't survive operating \Nthis farm as a single family.
0.5;so it could be revitalized \Nusing new techniques.
0.5;If you'd properly discussed \Nselling the farm as a family,
0.5;I know it was a misunderstanding, \Nbut she killed my father to help me.
0.5;They taste better since \Nwe picked them ourselves.
0.5;Tangerines are low in calories so I won't \Nget fat no matter how many I eat.

0.5;The bathrooms aren't that way!\NReally, now...
0.5;Why is the deal off?! I got the\Nmoney and didn't tell the police!
0.5;I can't say it out loud,\Nbut I think there was a kidnapping!
0.5;Just as you said, there's a good\Nchance they're holding him for ransom.
0.5;Yeah. It sounds like he\Nhasn't contacted the police.
0.5;But we don't know where\Nthe kidnapper is looking from,

0.5;I have a good idea!\NI'll be a patient!
0.5;I'm sorry to bother you\Non your day off.

0.5;Please come into\Nthe examination room...
0.5;Pardon my late introduction.\NI am Detective Mori Kogoro.
0.5;I see. So Conan-kun heard\Nmy phone conversation--
0.5;If the kid's right,\Nthen I can help you.
0.5;Alright. This may be\Nsome sort of fate.
0.5;Just as you said,\Nmy son was kidnapped.
0.5;I let him play by himself in\Nthe front yard this afternoon, but...
0.5;"""Took the kid. Call the police\Nand he's dead. Wait for a call."""
0.5;It was a young man's\Nvoice on the phone.
0.5;He told me to put 30 million\Nyen in used bills in a briefcase
0.5;and to be at Starlight\NHotel's beer garden at 6:00.
0.5;No. All he said was that he would\Ncall again tomorrow morning.
0.5;He probably never intended\Nto get the money tonight.
0.5;He likely watched Endo-san from\Nsomewhere in the beer garden
0.5;to make sure he hadn't\Ncontacted the police.
0.5;When you got the first call,\Ndid you hear Keita-kun's voice?
0.5;"He sounded unexpectedly cheerful;\Nhe didn't seem afraid at all."
0.5;That is odd. You would expect\Nhim to at least miss his mother.
0.5;Perhaps that's why Keita grew\Nfond of his kindergarten teacher
0.5;and the women in the\Nneighborhood.
0.5;The kidnapper is likely working\Nwith a woman good with children,
0.5;Meaning we can't rest easy,\Nbut it's unlikely they'll hurt Keita-kun.
0.5;Endo-san. I think you probably\Nshould call the police now...
0.5;Maybe the kidnappers will be\Ncaught if the police intervene!
0.5;But what guarantee do I have\NKeita will return unharmed?!
0.5;Please! Help bring\NKeita back unharmed!
0.5;Very well! I was\Nthe one who came to you!
0.5;Let's work together\Nto somehow solve this!
0.5;We'll leave for tonight and\Ntalk on the phone from now on.
0.5;You have nothing to worry about.\NI will return Keita-kun safely!
0.5;Now we just wait for\Nthe kidnappers to call!
0.5;They demanded 20 million more,\Nand gave me two hours to get it!
0.5;Yes. I had them put him\Non just like you said.
0.5;Yeah! There's lots\Nof crabs here, Daddy!

0.5;With any luck, I'll have\NKeita-kun back within two hours!
0.5;Dad! You have a clue\Nabout the kidnappers?!
0.5;Yeah! Keita-kun is by lots of\Ncrabs and a bubble-spouting whale!
0.5;Don't be dumb! Whales only\Nspout air deep underwater!
0.5;It wasn't a real whale that Keita-kun saw.\NIt was probably a model.
0.5;No. We do have various kinds\Nof crabs, but no whale models...
0.5;Say... Are you sure the\Ncrabs have to be real?
0.5;When Keita-kun said there\Nwere lots of crabs,
0.5;"the kidnapper said,\N""What are you talking about?"""
0.5;Doesn't that mean the\Nkidnapper couldn't see any?
0.5;So they didn't call\Nfrom the aquarium?
0.5;Oh, yeah! Nichiuri TV's\Nmascot is a whale this year!
0.5;If so, then he was\Nwhere that blimp was visible...
0.5;Got it! The blimp was above\NBeika Park when the kidnappers called!
0.5;Yesterday's deal was\Nat a hotel on Beika Street!
0.5;Let's go back and look\Nfor a place with lots of crabs!
0.5;Damn! Our time's up!\NThe kidnappers might've called.
0.5;They told him to stand at the\Nend of Platform 1 in Karajuku Station.
0.5;Yeah. You keep looking\Nfor the crabs, Conan.
0.5;Even if they did lose to the kidnappers,\Nmy transmitter's on the case!
0.5;They'll probably exchange\Nthe money elsewhere.
0.5;Yes. But Mori-san got the\Nlicense plate number on film.
0.5;It's staying in the same spot.\NTheir hideout should be nearby!
0.5;Darn it! They must've\Nchanged briefcases here!
0.5;Was this the kidnapper's?!\NWas that license plate a fake?!
0.5;Find where there's lots of crabs\Nand where the whale blimp was visible!
0.5;Didn't he say the whale\Nwas spouting air bubbles?
0.5;What does it mean? Was it not\Nthe blimp he saw?! Or maybe--
0.5;Keita-kun saw the smoke\Nfrom that waste incineration facility...
0.5;It would look like that only\Nwhere the park and the tower line up...
0.5;But this is too low. It needs to\Nbe the same altitude as the blimp
0.5;to make it look like\Nit's spouting air.
0.5;No doubt about it! Keita-kun\Nis in some room in this hotel!
0.5;Do you know which room\Nthis boy is staying in?
0.5;Alright! I found you!\NKeita-kun is still unharmed!

0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 985 \N""The Two Faces (Part One)"""
0.5;When detectives are bored, doesn't \Nthat mean the world is at peace?
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!
0.5;and the suspicious behavior \Nof her beloved husband!
0.5;Could you describe the events leading \Nup to your husband's disappearance?
0.5;My husband Muto Issei runs a trading company \Nthat imports and sells goods from overseas.
0.5;I believed our relationship \Nwas nothing short of perfect.
0.5;Last week, I went to a restaurant \Nto have lunch with some friends.
0.5;As I was heading home after finishing \Nlunch and parting ways with my friends,
0.5;I thought he was there for a meeting \Nand tried to call out to him...
0.5;But I saw him speaking intimately \Nwith a woman I didn't recognize.
0.5;I was curious about what their \Nrelationship was and followed them.
0.5;But they parted ways without \Ndoing anything in particular,
0.5;I did my best to chase \Nafter my fleeing husband.
0.5;But I doubt they understood \Neven half of what I had to say.
0.5;I waited at home for a \Nwhile to hear from them,
0.5;but it seemed like they \Nweren't making any progress,
0.5;I swear on my good name that \NI will find your husband.
0.5;By the way, do you have any idea why \Nyour husband might have disappeared?
0.5;Like I said before, I didn't think \Nwe had any problems until now.
0.5;Did you notice anything odd when \Nyou lost track of your husband?
0.5;Stop sticking your nose \Nwhere it doesn't belong!
0.5;but I think a vehicle drove \Naway just as I arrived.
0.5;First, I'd like to investigate \Nyour husband's office.
0.5;Ran-neechan told me to go with you \Nsince she's worried about you.
0.5;There's nothing suspicious among \Nthe documents in his desk.
0.5;No matter how you look at it, this \Nis clearly a first-rate corporation.
0.5;I'd like to meet with Muto-san \Nof the Muto Trading Company.
0.5;Hello? There's a detective here \Nat reception named Mori Kogoro.
0.5;I'm sorry. Muto is currently \Nout of the office.
0.5;It may be imaginary, but there must be \Nsomeone receiving phone calls and mail.
0.5;Why was the husband renting \Nan imaginary office here?
0.5;So this is where Masako-san \Nlost sight of her husband.
0.5;If he fled the moment he \Nsaw Masako-san's face,
0.5;Was he attacked by someone, \Nor did he fall into the river?
0.5;There should be some evidence around \Nhere backing up Masako-san's story.
0.5;These might be from the vehicle \NMasako-san said she saw driving away.
0.5;Judging by the width of the \Ntracks, it might be a microcar.
0.5;You're saying the president of a \Ntrading company ran off in a microcar?
0.5;It was discovered about 400 meters away from \Nthe river where I lost sight of my husband.
0.5;but his cards were still \Nhere, so they contacted me.
0.5;They're all receipts for convenience \Nstores and restaurants.
0.5;You think these receipts are the \Nkey to finding Issei-san, right?
0.5;How are those receipts \Nsupposed to help us find him?
0.5;Mister, you're going to use this map \Nto find the missing husband, right?
0.5;Ran-neechan, could you lay \Nthat map out over there?
0.5;I'll read out the names of \Nthe stores on these receipts,
0.5;But this is nowhere near Muto-san's \Nhouse or the virtual office.
0.5;The husband is secretly doing something in this \Narea other than running a trading company.
0.5;Unless you're buying a product that's \Nonly available at certain stores,
0.5;people generally go to the \Nclosest convenience store.
0.5;around the stores we marked \Na bunch of times...
0.5;It means the missing husband is \Nsomewhere inside these circles.
0.5;Furthermore, it's likely that he's \Nhere where the three circles overlap.
0.5;Mister, haven't you felt like something \Nis off since we visited Muto-san's house?
0.5;Even though he runs an \Nimport trading company,
0.5;They had nothing in common and were all \Ntotally different styles and brands.
0.5;Then there's the microcar \Ntire tracks at the river.
0.5;H-He's supposed to be the president of a \Ntrading company renting a virtual office,
0.5;After conducting an investigation \Nat your wife's request,
0.5;More importantly, Muto-san, I have \Nhonestly no idea why you left your wife.
0.5;In order to make myself look better, I \Nsaid I ran an import trading company.
0.5;I ended up marrying Masako before \NI could tell her the truth.
0.5;So you went as far as renting a \Nvirtual office to maintain the lie.
0.5;Your wife simply saw you \Nspeaking with a woman.
0.5;I thought I couldn't talk my \Nway out of it and panicked.
0.5;If you think it's not too late, \Nthen shouldn't you go back to her?
0.5;Can't you and your wife get \Nalong even after all this happened?
0.5;However, I don't think \Nyou should lie anymore.
0.5;Unbelievable. If he'd just told \Nme the truth from the start,
0.5;But all men want to show\Noff every now and then.
0.5;Missing person and infidelity \Ncases rarely end well,
0.5;Judging by the room's state, it looks like \Nthey were in a hurry to go somewhere.

0.5;I meant surely you didn't invite \Nthe great detective Mori Kogoro
0.5;to an inn deep in the mountains of \NNagano just to eat this slimy stuff!
0.5;A sickle. And speaking of \Nanimals that have sickles,
0.5;there's a demon that rides in on whirlwinds \Nand cuts people clean in half.
0.5;But I thought kamaitachi \Nhave sickles for fingers.
0.5;The background is the outdoor \Nbath here at this inn,
0.5;but this is a photo taken from the same \Nangle by the writer who published the photo.
0.5;He's clearly walking on \Nthe surface of the water.
0.5;Maybe he lined up a couple \Ntransparent platforms in the bath.
0.5;The water here is clouded\Nlike the Shirahone Hot Spring,
0.5;I even had an expert look at it, \Nso it's definitely the real thing.
0.5;Yeah. I'm Nakama Daigo, a \Nwriter for IZUNA magazine.
0.5;I'm here today to take a picture \Nof the kamaitachi myself.
0.5;What does the cold have \Nto do with kamaitachi?
0.5;The kamaitachi legend is \Npopular in snowy regions.
0.5;So if it snows tonight, he might \Ncome riding in on the snow and wind.
0.5;Even if he does appear, we can beat \Nhim up with my aikido and your karate.
0.5;W-We're talking about a creature armed \Nwith a sickle that flies around!
0.5;The kamaitachi never existed \Nin the first place.
0.5;You're here because you received so many \Ncomplaints about your phony photo, right?
0.5;Besides, that photo was mixed in \Nwith a bunch of voyeuristic photos
0.5;of the outdoor bath printed in another \None of your publisher's magazines.
0.5;I write for a rival magazine, so I came\Nto write an article on your hack writing.
0.5;Naturally, I won't let you \Nstage anything, either,
0.5;to make this non-existent \Nkamaitachi seem like it exists.
0.5;I saw the kamaitachi running \Nacross the hot spring.
0.5;Yeah. I tried to chase him, \Nbut I can't walk on water.
0.5;In fact, I almost drowned\Nbecause I couldn't move,
0.5;We're celebrating your birthday \Ntomorrow with your friends.
0.5;Sorry for publishing that \Nweird photo in the magazine.
0.5;No. Thanks to the photo, we've \Nbeen getting more guests.
0.5;Though because of the kamaitachi, fewer \Npeople have been using the outdoor bath.
0.5;Hmph. That monster will only bring \Nin more customers for a while.
0.5;It's not a fundamental solution \Nto our money problems.
0.5;That's the only way to \Nbring in more customers.
0.5;Well, once the fuss dies down and you \Ncan't keep the business open anymore,
0.5;Though it'd be a different story if that \Nkamaitachi actually killed someone.
0.5;He wants you to get naked so customers \Ncan eat sashimi off your body?
0.5;I've only ever seen that \Nin dirty historical dramas.
0.5;If it got out, you'd be charged \Nwith public indecency.
0.5;When we got married, my family and theirs \Nmerged our inns, and business was good.
0.5;there is a large sickle in the \Nstorehouse that a famous swordsmith
0.5;The sickle the kamaitachi \Nwas carrying in the photo?
0.5;Didn't you say you were \Ngoing to wait outside?
0.5;My late husband said it \Nwas worth 10 million yen.
0.5;I don't know what happened, \Nbut something cut my arm.
0.5;But I wonder if they'll believe you \Nwere assaulted by a kamaitachi.
0.5;Either way, they've got three people \Nright here who were cut by something.
0.5;Since we're in Nagoya, the \NNagano police will be coming.
0.5;That super smart one-eyed inspector \Nwill arrest the kamaitachi in no time.
0.5;Haibara mentioned the number two of the \NBlack Organization's special trait...
0.5;While I was in the organization, \NI heard all kinds of descriptions.
0.5;Either his right or left \Neye is an artificial eye.
0.5;And since he walks with a cane, \Nhe might look old from a distance.
0.5;No way. Inspector Yamato \Ncouldn't possibly be...
0.5;Gunma Police Inspector\NYamamura has arrived!
0.5;If the culprit is a kamaitachi, then of course\Nthey'll send me, Demon Hunter Yamamura.
0.5;Though in our scientific age of orbital \Nelevators that will take you to space,
0.5;Now show me to the storehouse where \Nyou were assaulted by the kamaitachi.
0.5;I see. You came here to \Nlook for an antique sickle.
0.5;someone cut the back of \NMori-san's right hand,
0.5;and the left cheek of the \Nwriter Koyanagi Midori-san.
0.5;The light bulb shattered just \Nas I found it and picked it up.
0.5;If he swung that around, we would've \Nbeen cut way worse than this.
0.5;Was there someone standing near the \Nlight bulb who could have broken it?
0.5;Just before the light bulb broke, \Neveryone was looking at the sickle.
0.5;but it wouldn't turn on when we \Nentered the storehouse today.
0.5;Come to think of it, this storehouse \Ndoesn't have a lock, does it?
0.5;All we ever stored in this storehouse \Nwe planned to demolish was rice.
0.5;But you said the sickle \Nwas worth 10 million yen.
0.5;My father-in-law thinks \Nit's just a piece of junk.
0.5;A few days ago, a burglar broke \Ninto the storehouse again.
0.5;I tried to replace the \Ndoor and put a lock on it,
0.5;but my father-in-law said we didn't \Nneed to since we're in the red.
0.5;It looks exactly like something an ancient \Ndemon would use, but don't worry.
0.5;I, Demon Hunter Yamamura,\Nwill catch him immediately,
0.5;When I nearly drowned in the hot spring, \NI was probably saved by the kamaitachi.
0.5;Come to think of it, you really celebrated \Nyour son's birthday every year.
0.5;During a party for my husband's \Nsurvival game friends,
0.5;Well, I'm sure someone \Ndid it in the darkness.
0.5;We still don't know how \Nthey broke the light bulb,
0.5;but they definitely used a piece of a \Ndifferent light bulb that they had all along, right?
0.5;Yeah. By throwing it on the \Nfloor after cutting everyone,
0.5;they could make it look like one of \Nthe pieces that was broken off then.
0.5;After examining the sickle for \Nblood, the results determined
0.5;And? Did you examine the shards of the\Nlight bulb scattered on the floor, too?
0.5;Yes, though there was \Nnothing unusual about them.
0.5;We gathered up all the pieces and \Nreassembled them into their original shape,
0.5;The only unusual things we found were \Ncigarette butts and a piece of chewed gum.
0.5;I believe an old light bulb simply shattered \Nand happened to hit the three of you.
0.5;Then we should've felt \Npain the instant it broke.
0.5;That sounded like something \Nbreaking and bursting!
0.5;Is that building on the other \Nside of the fence the annex?
0.5;The kamaitachi rode the \Nwind across the water!
0.5;It doesn't look like there are any \Ntransparent platforms in the water.
0.5;There's a hallway connecting \Nthe annex to the main building,
0.5;but we could go outside and come\Nback in through the back door.
0.5;Since only our footprints \Nare here, that means...
0.5;It's broken as though \Nsomething cut through it.
0.5;Demons don't bother with breaking \Nwindows or shutting off breakers.

0.5;"Second, ""Shinto Statue"" clearly\Nrefers to the Shinto Shrine."
0.5;...the killer must be you,\NMamegaki Taeko-san!
0.5;Taeko-san. You were gone for nearly\Nan hour during the party, correct?
0.5;Grandfather was out at the time,\Nso I was the only one there...
0.5;But Taeko-san came back just\Nas Anzai-san left the inn!
0.5;After she came back, she stayed\Nin the hall the whole time...
0.5;That means she couldn't\Npossibly have killed him.
0.5;No. But it looks like\Nsomeone wiped them away.
0.5;If the killer had time to wipe\Nthe fingerprints off,
0.5;why not run off with\Nthe murder weapon instead?!
0.5;Did anyone among you leave the inn\Nbetween 10:00 and 10:30?
0.5;I happened to look\Nat my watch just then!
0.5;I hear you were the only one who\Ndecided to stay at the Teitan Hotel
0.5;My pride as a leading man wouldn't\Nlet me stay in such a hovel!
0.5;The killer's someone\Non the filming crew...
0.5;"Our only clue is the phrase ""Shinto Statue,""\Nwhich the victim wrote..."
0.5;Taeko-san is the one most closely\Nconnected to Shinto statues...
0.5;But she returned to the inn\Njust as the victim was leaving it.
0.5;Shimazaki-san went to buy\Ncigarettes at 9:45
0.5;More than enough time\Nto commit the murder.
0.5;But it was 10:30 when we saw\Nthe person at the shrine.
0.5;Nachi-san has no alibi after 10:00--\Nhe could have done it as well.
0.5;It sounded like he was being\Nblackmailed by the victim,
0.5;so in terms of motive,\Nhe's the most suspicious.
0.5;And Nachi-san was most likely\Nthe one we saw in the shadows!
0.5;Inspector! We found these\Nin the victim's room!
0.5;Nachi-san... This is you leaving\Na hotel with a woman...
0.5;I saw Anzai-san trying to\Nblackmail Nachi-san earlier!
0.5;"If I killed him, then what the hell\Ndoes ""Shinto Statue"" mean?!"
0.5;You sure that's not\None of your nicknames?
0.5;No leading man like me would\Nhave a crappy nickname like that!
0.5;"What exactly does this\N""Shinto Statue"" mean?!"
0.5;Why would he go through the\Ntrouble of writing it down?!
0.5;He was killed right\Nin front of a Shinto statue--
0.5;Do you even have any proof\Nthat I was here?!
0.5;This man was an adult, but he\Ncouldn't even write katakana right!
0.5;You're supposed to write\Nthis part here all in one stroke.
0.5;What if these incorrect strokes were\Nactually lines that were added later?!
0.5;The only leading man\Naround here is Nachi Shingo!
0.5;It looks like some definitive\Nproof has shown itself.
0.5;I'll admit that I was supposed\Nto meet Anzai here at 10:30,
0.5;It's the truth! He really\Nwas dead when I got here!
0.5;"I was about to run away, but then\NI saw ""leading man"" written there..."
0.5;So I added some vertical lines like\Nin the matchstick puzzles that I do!
0.5;"If you're not the killer, then why\Ndid the victim write ""leading man""?"
0.5;It's not normal for someone\Nto fake a dying message
0.5;"Maybe the real killer altered\Nthe message to say ""leading man""!"
0.5;Listen to how pathetic you sound,\NMr. Leading Man!
0.5;You can give us the details\Ndown at the station.
0.5;Inspector Megure.\NNachi-san is not the murderer.
0.5;The reason being that the murder\Ntook place before 10:00!
0.5;We saw Anzai-san leave\Nthe inn around 10:00!
0.5;Inspector. Have a look\Nat the victim's wristwatch.
0.5;In other words, someone removed\Nthe watch from the body
0.5;This particular person wanted to\Nmake it look like the murder happened
0.5;and setting the alarm off\Nin the victim's room.
0.5;But it would cause problems if blood\Ndripped off it on the way back,
0.5;That means the person\Nwe saw at the inn was--
0.5;The person who set the alarm\Noff in Anzai-san's room
0.5;"Then the killer wrote ""leading man""\Nto make Nachi-san look guilty!"
0.5;If the killer wanted\NNachi-san to look guilty,
0.5;That would have been a much\Nmore effective way of fooling us!
0.5;The reason being that the victim\Nhad already written something
0.5;"""Leading man"" was actually a\Nsingle word that the victim wrote,"
0.5;Then what was the\Noriginal word the victim wrote?!
0.5;Mamegaki Taeko-san.\NYou're the murderer.
0.5;Taeko-san returned to the inn just as\Nthe person disguised as Anzai-san left!
0.5;Shimazaki-san. You were indeed\Nthe one who dressed up as him,
0.5;See the huge spray of blood\Naround the body?
0.5;The killer must have been covered\Nin a lot of blood as well.
0.5;But there's not even a single\Ndrop on your clothes.
0.5;The only person who had time\Nto change clothes and wash off the blood
0.5;I take it you didn't know Shimazaki-san\Nhad dressed up as him?
0.5;So I was really shocked when\NI saw Anzai-san at the front door...
0.5;Taeko-san. Anzai was blackmailing\Nyou too, wasn't he?
0.5;When I was in high school,\NI turned rebellious for a short time
0.5;I stopped going to school and started\Nhanging out with the wrong crowd...
0.5;Remember when everyone\Nwas in an uproar
0.5;after that expensive statue was stolen\Nfrom the shrine storehouse?
0.5;After I mentioned it to Anzai,\Nhe immediately went and stole it...
0.5;But Sugiyama-san, who was\Nin charge of the storehouse,
0.5;felt responsible for it\Nand killed himself!
0.5;I was too scared to say anything\Nafter seeing that!
0.5;After that, I quit hanging\Naround Anzai and the others,
0.5;and I started taking school\Nseriously again.
0.5;I had nearly managed to suppress\Nthe memories of that detestable event!
0.5;All I wanted was to marry Yuji-san\Nand start a happy family!
0.5;He said that since\NI had been an accomplice,
0.5;I was just as responsible\Nfor Sugiyama-san's suicide!
0.5;I felt that if something wasn't done,\Nhe would ruin our marriage!
0.5;I was supposed to pay Anzai\Nsome money here at 9:30 tonight.
0.5;But instead, I brought a knife\Nand threatened Anzai back!
0.5;I told him never to show\Nhis face around me ever again!
0.5;...and then the knife\Njust happened to--
0.5;You seemed strange when you left,\Nso I pretended to go buy cigarettes.
0.5;"and the word ""Mame"" was\Nwritten in blood next to him."
0.5;I figured you were\Nthe one who killed him,
0.5;so I tried my hardest\Nto alter all the evidence!
0.5;I should've just gotten rid\Nof that writing in blood!
0.5;But then I remembered how he threatened\NNachi-san earlier this evening,
0.5;"so I made ""Mame"" say\N""leading man"" instead!"
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 974 ""Target: MPD \NTransportation Department (Part Four)"""
0.5;Sergeant Momosaki and \NLieutenant Yagi were murdered
0.5;one after another in the \Npolicewoman serial murder case.
0.5;It was determined that the dying messages \Nthey left behind pointed to no parking signs.
0.5;I had no idea Japanese road signs \Nwere based off English ones.
0.5;Japanese road signs are \Nbased off English ones...
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""Target: MPD Transportation \NDepartment, Part Four!"""
0.5;One week ago, there was a \Nwoman who committed suicide
0.5;by jumping from the roof of an office \Nbuilding on Second Street in Haido City.
0.5;Since she worked at the \Nbuilding she jumped from,
0.5;You know who killed Sergeant \NMomosaki and Lieutenant Yagi?
0.5;They were extremely angry when they \Nwere brought into the police station,
0.5;They were Aono, who forgot his license \Nand was using his phone while driving,
0.5;Akamine, who was riding a motorcycle \Nagainst traffic without a helmet,
0.5;and Shiroyama, whose inspection was expired \Nand forgot to wear his seat belt, right?
0.5;And most likely, both the first victim \NSergeant Momosaki was pointing at
0.5;and the second victim Lieutenant \NYagi was facing a no parking sign.
0.5;Do you know why signs prohibiting something \Nare a circle with a diagonal line?
0.5;Because the shape is combination \Nof the letters N and O.
0.5;"No parking signs are a ""no"" \Nlayered on top of a blue sign."
0.5;Do you really think they made a \Nlame pun with their dying messages?
0.5;but if that's the only thing you saw in \Nthe vicinity, wouldn't you do the same?
0.5;Dying messages can't be \Nnoticed by the culprit,
0.5;Most people don't know the \Nhistory of road signs,
0.5;but it's likely an officer of the \NTransportation Department would notice.
0.5;It probably refers to road traffic \Nlaw article 71, section 5-5.
0.5;While operating a vehicle, drivers must \Nnot hold their phone in their hand
0.5;In other words, I think we can \Nassume it refers to Aono-san,
0.5;We've received information \Nidentifying Aono Kengo
0.5;as the suspect in the policewoman \Nserial murder case.
0.5;I'm ordering the emergency \Ndeployment of police forces
0.5;He's a dangerous criminal who \Nhas murdered two of our own.
0.5;For the dignity of the police, \Nwe must arrest him!
0.5;According to his neighbors, they \Nhaven't seen him for several days.
0.5;this afternoon they told a woman who \Ncame to ask about his whereabouts
0.5;that he was probably at his girlfriend's \Nplace if he wasn't at home.
0.5;There are a lot of patrol \Ncars driving around.
0.5;They're looking for the suspect \Nwho murdered two police officers.
0.5;So I recommend you release me \Nimmediately and turn yourself in!
0.5;If you want me to release \Nyou, just tell me already.
0.5;Then I'll push her out the \Nwindow and break her head open,
0.5;Though she might trigger a trap \Nfirst and end up skewered instead.
0.5;Aono Kengo's girlfriend killed herself by \Njumping off the building she worked at?
0.5;Apparently she couldn't take \Nthe power harassment
0.5;"Aono received a text from his \Ngirlfriend that said ""goodbye."""
0.5;He rushed out of work, got into \Nhis car without his license,
0.5;and was caught by Sergeant Momosaki and \NLieutenant Yagi while he was on his way to her.
0.5;He believes he could've prevented his \Ngirlfriend's suicide if that hadn't happened.
0.5;she called Aono immediately \Nafter texting him, right?
0.5;so they were able to confirm the \Nmessage's contents at the scene.
0.5;The officers who came to help \Nquestion them heard what he said.
0.5;Someone might die, and you're \Ntalking about karaoke?!
0.5;The two of them had a mutual friend named \NYumiko who they went to karaoke with.
0.5;Did Aono hear that name then \Nand plan to kill Yumi-san next?
0.5;If you're looking for someone named \NYumi among their acquaintances,
0.5;Due to certain circumstances, \NI'm driving him home right now.
0.5;Is the number I just sent \Nhim Yumi-san's number?
0.5;but I heard four sets of a fingernail \Ntapping a phone seven times.
0.5;"After that, I heard a male voice say, ""Hey, \Nwhat are you doing?!"" before they hung up."
0.5;It's possible the culprit figured \Nout she's a police officer
0.5;and kidnapped her so he can lure \NYumi-san to him and murder her!
0.5;If he plans to call her to him, \Nthen he can't be that far.
0.5;What places are nearby that the \Nculprit would be familiar with?
0.5;a planetarium, a sports \Nfacility, a restaurant...
0.5;The only clue we have is the four sets \Nof seven taps that Detective Chiba heard.
0.5;By the way, Chiba-kun, how \Ndid the sound you heard go?
0.5;Twinkle twinkle little star, \Nhow I wonder what you are.
0.5;Up above the world so high, \Nlike a diamond in the sky.
0.5;The lyrics are four phrases \Nof seven syllables each.
0.5;She could only communicate using \Nsounds because her mouth is covered!
0.5;"The culprit works as a remodeler, and \Nthen there's ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star!"""
0.5;In other words, she's being held in the \Nplanetarium that's being remodeled!
0.5;The planetarium is near the park we were \Njust at that was the scene of the first murder.
0.5;Damn it. You're determined \Nnot to talk, aren't you?
0.5;Aono Kengo, you're under arrest for the \Nmurders of two female police officers.
0.5;The police have been \Ncalling you over and over.
0.5;But since that day, that moment, \NI haven't looked at the screen!
0.5;no matter how often I look at it, \NAiko never says anything to me!
0.5;Because you police wouldn't \Nlet me go, Aiko is...
0.5;Weren't you driving without a \Nlicense while using your phone?
0.5;But they wasted my time by talking \Nabout karaoke on the phone
0.5;I wanted to get to my girlfriend \Nto convince her not to do it!
0.5;It was a coincidence that \Nthey received a call.
0.5;Even if it hadn't happened, \Nthey wouldn't have let you go.
0.5;It was clear from your behavior \Nthat you were out of your mind.
0.5;especially not if their \Nloved ones are involved.
0.5;It's the reason the policewomen \Nyou killed did their jobs.
0.5;who's lost their cool won't take the \Nlife of someone else's loved on.
0.5;Talk all you want, but Aiko still \Ndied because you guys stopped me!
0.5;If that hadn't happened, \NI could've saved Aiko!
0.5;Your girlfriend left a \Nvoicemail on your phone.
0.5;No, you don't even seem to \Nknow that she called you.
0.5;She called you a minute after \Nshe sent that last text.
0.5;it's possible you didn't \Nnotice she was calling.
0.5;But you were looking at your \Nphone while driving after that.
0.5;You were so preoccupied that \Nthe police stopped you.
0.5;This important notification was visible \Nto you, but you didn't notice.
0.5;Just sending a text seems bland, \Nso I'll tell you directly.
0.5;I parked my car far away so \Nthe suspect wouldn't notice.
0.5;You may think no one's \Nwatching, but I'm watching.
0.5;A-Are you really my childhood \Nfriend Naeko-chan?
0.5;Uh, oh! I forgot to return Naeko-san's \Nphone after I picked it up.
0.5;Hey, while I was sleeping at Chukichi's \Nplace, Miwako called me 54 times.
0.5;I've been trying to call her \Nback, but her line's been busy.
0.5;As you said, I gave all the \Ninformation I could to that boy.
0.5;Though my information didn't do \Nmuch to help him solve the case.
0.5;It's better not to have to \Nput out unnecessary fires.
0.5;Try pressing the button \Non the remote control.
0.5;He beautifully dances his \Nmystery-solving steps!
0.5;he takes on cutting-edge technology \Nwith his detective skills.
0.5;It was designed as a \Nself-defense robot for women.
0.5;Why would you use our cutting-edge \Ntechnology to create mischievous products?
0.5;Today's the last day they'll \Nbe making fun of me.
0.5;I already told you not to get \Ntoo involved in online auctions.
0.5;They'd be on their guard if it \Nwere just the famous Mori-san.
0.5;Before coming here, I conducted \Na stakeout at Myojo Technics,
0.5;where you suspect information \Nis being leaked to.
0.5;It was the original components \Nthat were stolen, yes?
0.5;That's right. I have no idea how he \Ngot them out of the plant, though.
0.5;Since they're for precision instruments, they'd \Nbreak if you threw them out a window.
0.5;Direct sunlight is bad for \Nprecision instruments.
0.5;They say if you want to hide a leaf, \Nyou should hide it in the forest.
0.5;There's an important presentation \Nat the other company tomorrow.
0.5;All the rooms here lock from the inside, \Nso we'll have to call a locksmith.
0.5;We found ligature marks on the \Npalms of his hands as well.
0.5;We're still waiting to hear from forensics, \Nbut we believe it's the murder weapon.
0.5;He was also bleeding from \Nthe back of his head.
0.5;I heard something fall before \Nthe gas alarm sounded.
0.5;Judging by the footprints on the \Nfloor and the broken gas pipe,
0.5;By the way, we found this among the \Nobjects in Tanizaki-san's pockets.
0.5;That's a new robot part \Nour company is developing.
0.5;He locked the door from the \Ninside so no one could enter,
0.5;and invited a non-employee \Ninto the storeroom.
0.5;However, there was a problem, \Nand Tanizaki-san was murdered.
0.5;Could you tell us where you \Nwere when the murder occurred?
0.5;but I realized I had forgotten \Nsomething and returned to get it.
0.5;On your way back, did you spot \Nany suspicious figures outside?
0.5;Does that mean the killer \Nbroke in from the outside?
0.5;We may be able to solve this \Ncase sooner than expected.
0.5;Today's the last day they'll \Nbe making fun of me.
0.5;Makita-san belongs to the \Ngeneral affairs department
0.5;that has nothing to do with \Ntechnological development.
0.5;Surely even the general affairs department \Nwould've wanted the information.
0.5;Earlier you said Tanizaki-san was \Nresponsible for the leaked information.
0.5;Tanizaki-san was attempting \Nto catch the leak.
0.5;Tanizaki-san's mouse robot was \Nactually a security device.
0.5;It can identify the culprit \Nusing its sensors.
0.5;The same thing happened to you \Nwhen you snuck into the room.
0.5;You keep the special ink these \Nsensors respond to at home?
0.5;so the culprit couldn't \Nexplain his way out of it.
0.5;No, it was some guy named Hiraguchi \Nfrom their R&D department.
0.5;According to Makita-san, he asked about \Nthe date of their next presentation.
0.5;He needed to know so he could \Nset a trap for the leak.
0.5;That's why I said we should \Npostpone it, but...
0.5;I did hit him when we got into a \Nfight, but I didn't strangle him.
0.5;I would've seen the culprit \Nflee if they were an outsider.
0.5;I wouldn't kill him just \Nbecause I didn't like him.
0.5;You thought Tanizaki was the leak \Nand killed him for his betrayal.
0.5;Before leaving the office, Isshiki-san \Nhid the components in this room.
0.5;He chose this room because it's \Nnot normally used by anyone.
0.5;After unlocking the windows so \Nhe could enter from the outside,
0.5;There's nothing on the \Noutside wall to tie it to.
0.5;between the ventilation fan \Nabove the water heater.
0.5;allowing him to commit countless thefts \Nwithout leaving any evidence behind.
0.5;He secretly returned and \Nwaited beneath the window.
0.5;He waited for the right \Nmoment to climb the wall
0.5;and entered the room through \Nthe window he left unlocked.
0.5;by something else: \NTanizaki-san was in the room.
0.5;Knowing the theft would happen tonight since \Nthe presentation was scheduled for tomorrow,
0.5;Tanizaki-san found the hidden \Ncomponents and hid in the room.
0.5;He locked the room so the \Nthief couldn't escape.
0.5;Then Tanizaki-san and \NIsshiki-san got into a fight.
0.5;He began bleeding from his \Nhead when he was struck.
0.5;I had no idea there was a \Nmurderer in the office, though.
0.5;Your fall was stopped because \NTanizaki-san grabbed the rope.
0.5;The rope became tangled \Naround Tanizaki-san's neck.
0.5;The rust on the water heater \Nand Tanizaki-san's back.
0.5;And more than anything, the \Nblood on the fan proves it.
0.5;Isshiki-san, your series of \Nthefts took Tanizaki-san's life.
0.5;I thought I could find that guy \Nand turn him in to the police.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""A Pair of Crossing Fates!"""
0.5;The old man went to meet a client who had \Nreceived a murder threat in the mail.
0.5;However, Takarada had actually \Nbeen strangled to death,
0.5;Shinkai-san was arrested \Nfor mutilating a corpse.
0.5;fell under suspicion when his \Nfingerprints were found on the letter.
0.5;When the wig that was \Nevidence in the crime was found,
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;with the body of a child and the mind of \Nan adult, his name is Detective Conan!
0.5;and his brother Koji-san \Nwould inherit everything.
0.5;Um, I'd like to talk to \Nyou about Shinkai Haruyuki,
0.5;So what did you want to \Ndiscuss about Shinkai-san?
0.5;Shinkai and I have been friends since \Nwe grew up in the same foster home.
0.5;So if there's anything I can do\Nto lighten his sentence, I want to do it.
0.5;Around one yesterday when \NTakarada-san was murdered,
0.5;you were at a department \Nstore in Shinjuku, right?
0.5;Apparently Shinkai-san is \Nsaying you threatened him
0.5;I've got other people to back up \Nmy alibi besides the secretary.
0.5;It was some guy named Yaginuma \Nwho I'd previously conned.
0.5;The reason I was so composed \Nwhen the police suspected me
0.5;was because I just had to call \Nin Yaginuma as my witness.
0.5;Knowing that he'd beat me \Nhalf to death if I did.
0.5;Isn't that what you call \Nfishing in troubled waters?
0.5;Takarada Yoichi was \Nmurdered by his wife Mika.
0.5;to draw him out of the house \Nso he wouldn't have an alibi.
0.5;If that's true, then don't you \Nthink her plan was too careless?
0.5;Because she didn't, he has a \Nwitness named Yaginuma-san.
0.5;And because the blonde wig was \Nthrown away so offhandedly,
0.5;Are you sure you want to \Nwrite her off as stupid?
0.5;It's not possible for \NMika-san to have done it.
0.5;Now that we know this man \Ndid it, the case is settled.
0.5;But that would mean it was \Nplanned from the start.
0.5;What kind of ridiculous epiphany \Ndid you have this time?
0.5;If you pretend to be me\Nagain, you'll pay for it!
0.5;But no matter what kind of \Nbackground that person has...
0.5;For happily wearing the gaudiest \Nclothes he can get his hands on.
0.5;He's right. I did receive a \Nphone call from a tenant.
0.5;They said a suspicious \Nfigure headed upstairs.
0.5;You're the one who asked me \Nto bring these three here.
0.5;But, Inspector, you said you figured \Nout the truth behind the case.
0.5;It's time to discuss the \Nevents of this case in full.
0.5;then what need was there for him \Nto stab him two hours later?
0.5;Shinkai-san did testify that \Nhe planned to murder Takarada
0.5;since more victims would be created \Nas long as he lived, but...
0.5;Takarada probably told you himself \Nthat he had only six months to live.
0.5;In other words, in six months \NMika-san would inherit the fortune
0.5;Then Mika-san would lose the \Nright to Takarada's fortune
0.5;In other words, you didn't murder \NTakarada-san to kill him.
0.5;You seem determined to paint \Nme as the true culprit,
0.5;I should've put her fingerprints \Non the threatening letter.
0.5;When Koji, the perfect \Npawn, came to the mansion,
0.5;Why aren't you responding \Nto my counterargument?
0.5;Later, you urged Takarada \Nto come to this room alone.
0.5;And you told Mika-san that \Nthe president asked her
0.5;Ma'am, you were asked by Takarada \Nto organize the storehouse, correct?
0.5;You planned this so she would \Nhave no one to back up her alibi.
0.5;You also pretended to be \Nan imaginary person
0.5;The place was crowded with families \Nthere to see the hero show.
0.5;then perhaps you can tell us about \Nthe commotion that occurred.
0.5;You could've learned about the \Nhero show before that day.
0.5;You could also naturally assume the \Nplace would be crowded with families,
0.5;You're accusing me because \Nyou have proof, right?
0.5;and entered this building \Nthrough the rear entrance.
0.5;You left the letter you \Nhad brought in the room,
0.5;You called me so I would \Nwitness that decisive moment,
0.5;since I have the absolute \Ntrust of the police.
0.5;while you waited for your \Nschemes to come into effect.
0.5;Koji fell under suspicion due to \Nhis fingerprints on the letter.
0.5;But before she knew it, \Nthe situation changed.
0.5;the killer deliberately wrote a letter \Nwith Koji's fingerprints on it,
0.5;It was a reversal filled \Nwith hatred for Mika-san.
0.5;And of course, it began when you \Nreversed your alibi testimony.

0.5;But now it's time for the \Ngreat detective to shine.
0.5;she and her phone should've \Nfallen in the river.
0.5;In other words, the selfie stick was \Nplaced to make it look like an accident
0.5;The killer lured her out \Nusing a free texting service.
0.5;Later, she gave her own \Nexcuse and went after her.
0.5;the killer asked her for \Ntips on taking good photos
0.5;Then, she convinced Yuko-san to go into the \Nwatermill after breaking the lock beforehand
0.5;and struck Yuko-san with some \Nnatural ice, killing her.
0.5;In the watermill were traces \Nof sawdust being swept.
0.5;the killer used a cart to transport \Nthe body from the watermill.
0.5;and left the selfie stick on the riverbank \Nso it would look like she fell.
0.5;But Mori-kun, when Yuko-san fell in \Nthe river, weren't they with you?
0.5;You saw Yuko float down the \Nriver with the red water.
0.5;That time is exactly what the killer \Ncarefully calculated as part of their trick.
0.5;Pools are naturally formed when sections of \Nthe river curve and separate from the main river.
0.5;Put a body in one and direct water towards it, \Nand eventually it will flow out into the river.
0.5;The one who planned all of \Nthis was you, Maria-san.
0.5;She probably got them from the thorns of \Nwild roses while being carried to the pool.
0.5;Those same scratches should \Nbe on the killer's body.
0.5;You weren't wearing band-aids \Nwhen you first arrived,

0.5;Inspector, I had forensics \Nexamine the watermill.

0.5;They seem on such bad terms,\Nbut she still pushed the button for her.
0.5;Did you both remember\Nto wash your hands?
0.5;Why's she so worked up about\Nsomeone not answering their phone?
0.5;The elevator Taniguchi-san\Nused is stuck on the 8th floor.
0.5;For now, let's take this elevator up\Nand see for ourselves.
0.5;It would seem they were made\Nby dust from the emergency stairs!
0.5;They snuck in, found Mika-san,\Nand then stabbed her!
0.5;It's almost like she knew this\Nwould happen to Taniguchi-san...

0.5;But the strangest thing is that\NTaniguchi-san is lying on the ground
0.5;If she was stabbed\Nas she got off the elevator,
0.5;In which case, the killer must've\Npurposely pulled her into the hallway.
0.5;You and Taniguchi-san were riding\Nin different elevators, correct?
0.5;And then the one we took just\Nnow stops at the 8th floor,
0.5;then comes back down\Nin single-floor increments...
0.5;Only two elevators can\Ngo to the 15th floor.
0.5;How much time passed from when\NAshiya-san first got into the elevator
0.5;No, a little more\Nthan one minute, I think.
0.5;The emergency stairwell exit\Non the 1st floor was unlocked.
0.5;Did anyone enter or leave\Nthe building afterwards?
0.5;I arrived about an hour ago\Nand was in my office for half an hour.
0.5;I left through the main entrance,\Nof course.
0.5;this was the work of a burglar\Nbreaking into the building!
0.5;The killer unlocked the 1st floor\Nemergency exit from the outside
0.5;Then, just as he passed\Nby the elevators...
0.5;He murdered her,\Nthen escaped back down the stairs.
0.5;Alright! Search the\Nnearby vicinity immediately!
0.5;Also, I'll need to take\Nyour fingerprints, Ashiya-san.
0.5;It's to distinguish between\Nthe killer's fingerprints and yours!
0.5;Besides, there's no way you could\Npossibly have been the murderer!
0.5;Eiko-san and Taniguchi-san got\Nin different elevators at the same time.
0.5;...and there was no elevator\Nto take her to the 8th floor!
0.5;But that doesn't clear her\Nof all suspicion--
0.5;You're just a kid--\Ndon't tell a pro how to do his job!
0.5;What a lost cause!\NCan't depend on him at all!
0.5;If I'm right, the key to solving\Nthis case should be on the 15th floor!
0.5;Wow! The company president's floor\Nsure is nice!
0.5;She wouldn't have passed by here\Nif she went straight to her office...
0.5;Taniguchi-san was killed inside\Nthis elevator on the 8th floor.
0.5;Ashiya Eiko-san was all\Nby herself for just over a minute.
0.5;Taking the stairs to the 8th floor,\Nkilling her, and then coming back up
0.5;Meaning that the question here\Nis where exactly she was killed.
0.5;The way her body\Nwas lying on the ground...
0.5;The blood stain and the unnaturally\Ncrumpled part of her jacket...
0.5;And the tape marks around\Nthe call button for the elevator
0.5;This is an alibi trick\Ninvolving elevators!
0.5;Taniguchi-san's murderer\Nwas indeed Ashiya Eiko!
0.5;Nope. There were none on the knife\Nnor on the 1st floor emergency exit.
0.5;Excuse me, Inspector.\NWould it be all right if I went home?
0.5;Of course. That should\Nbe enough for today...
0.5;Oh no! If she goes,\Nshe'll dispose of the evidence!
0.5;...that you're the one\Nwho murdered Taniguchi Mika-san!
0.5;You were the one who just explained\Nwhy she couldn't have done it!
0.5;But first, allow me to explain those\Nfootprints in the 8th floor hallway.
0.5;Try to remember what\Nthose footprints looked like.
0.5;Normally, someone would run away\Nafter committing a murder, correct?
0.5;This would cause the footprints\Nto be far apart.
0.5;However, these footprints\Nwere made by someone walking
0.5;on both their way into\Nand out of the building.
0.5;I see. Now that you mention it,\Nyou're right...
0.5;You entered the building\Nan hour before the murder,
0.5;and then unlocked the 1st floor\Nemergency exit from the inside.
0.5;After this, you hid the sneakers\Nthat don't fit you inside your large purse
0.5;You came back 30 minutes later,\Nafter you had disposed of the sneakers.
0.5;you headed for the elevator hall\Nwith Taniguchi Mika-san.
0.5;You were the one who\Npressed the call button.
0.5;The reason being that you needed her\Nto use the center elevator
0.5;instead of the one\Nthat was nearest to her.
0.5;Inside the elevator, you started\Ndialing her number on your cell phone.
0.5;It's hard for cell phones to connect\Nwhile inside elevators, you see.
0.5;You told Taniguchi-san to come\Nto the 15th floor right away.
0.5;Meanwhile, you taped a coin to\Nthe call button on the 15th floor.
0.5;You did this to make sure the\Nelevator doors wouldn't close
0.5;Now we come to the\Nmain point of the trick.
0.5;If she had been stabbed by someone\Nas she was getting off the elevator,
0.5;But she was lying outside of the elevator,\Nfacing away from it.
0.5;Eiko-san stabbed Taniguchi-san\Non the 15th floor,
0.5;got behind her, and then turned her\Nin the direction of the hallway.
0.5;Then she pressed the button\Nfor the 8th floor
0.5;and removed the tape\Nfrom the call button.
0.5;She then propped Taniguchi-san up\Nin a sitting position
0.5;I can't believe she\Nwould do such a thing...
0.5;There were two keys to unraveling\Nthe mystery behind this alibi trick.
0.5;It was created when the jacket was\Ncaught between the elevator doors.
0.5;The second key was in the flower petal\Nand pollen left on the carpet
0.5;when Eiko-san put\Nthe bouquet on the floor
0.5;so it wouldn't get in the way\Nof killing Taniguchi-san.
0.5;Besides, if Taniguchi-san rode\Nthe 8th floor elevator a second time,
0.5;her fingerprint should have been\Non the 8th floor call button.
0.5;Indeed. Because you removed\Nher fingerprint yourself.
0.5;In order to close the elevator doors,\Nyou pressed the call button
0.5;and then removed her fingerprint\Nby wiping it off.
0.5;Wait a minute! Does that mean\Nthere's no proof?!
0.5;The bloody gloves she used\Nwhen committing the murder.
0.5;Time-wise, she shouldn't have\Nbeen able to dispose of them.
0.5;And she couldn't dare hide\Nthem inside the building.
0.5;You were more than confident\Nabout your elevator alibi trick.
0.5;The one who stole your design\Nand sold it to that rival company...
0.5;She said she didn't care\Nif I went to the police
0.5;doing so would only damage\Nthe Ashiya Eiko brand name even more.
0.5;I decided to kill her\Nwhile she was still with the company.
0.5;When I heard your father was the\Nfamous detective Mori Kogoro-san,
0.5;but I was telling the truth when\NI told you why I wanted you as a model.

0.5;I only remember Yagi-san, who \Nwent with us, walking me home.
0.5;Karaoke Beika on fourth street, across from \Nthe planetarium that's being remodeled.
0.5;Then maybe she was attacked while \Ntrying to use the park bathroom.
0.5;But if the suspect bludgeoned \Na third dan judoka to death,
0.5;Or they knew she was a cop \Nand planned a countermeasure.
0.5;Maybe it was the work of someone \Nwho bore some financial resentment.
0.5;We'll have to canvas the \Narea to gather information,
0.5;but for now, our only clue \Nis this 100 yen coin.
0.5;but there's a scrape along the first joint \Nof her middle, ring, and pinkie fingers.
0.5;If you flip it over, there's a scrape \Nalong the bottom of her palm, too.
0.5;Which means her left hand was \Nactually shaped like this
0.5;So she was trying to tell us \Nsomething by pointing somewhere?
0.5;Maybe that means she knew the \Nculprit would move her hand
0.5;so she used her own blood \Nto leave a fingerprint.
0.5;There's a stain from where her \Nbloody finger scraped against it.
0.5;In other words, she was actually \Npointing in that direction.
0.5;Who else was with the victim \Nat the karaoke box last night?
0.5;Lieutenant Yagi Shiori also of the \NTransportation Department was with them.
0.5;Since it's still early, \Nshe's probably at home.
0.5;Someone go to Lieutenant \NYagi's place immediately.
0.5;We ran into Yumi-san and Naeko-san in their \Nmini patrol car while on our way to school.
0.5;but you were already \Ninvestigating the crime scene.
0.5;Sato-san and I happened to be \Nconducting a stakeout in the area.
0.5;So you were with Detective \NSato all night last night.
0.5;Last night, Toko, Miike, \Nand I went to karaoke.
0.5;I said I'd walk Miike home since she was drunk \Nand parted ways with Toko in front of the store.
0.5;It looked like she was trying \Nto stop by the park bathroom.
0.5;Toko used the bathroom just \Nbefore we left the karaoke box.
0.5;Last night she said she felt like she was \Nbeing followed starting about a week ago.
0.5;She pointed at that swing \Nset just before she died.
0.5;Well, I need to tell Toko's \Nfriends about what happened.
0.5;The body discovered in the park \Nbelonged to Sergeant Momosaki Toko,
0.5;a member of the Transportation Department \Nlike Yumi-san and Naeko-san.
0.5;The evidence left behind \Nincluded a bent 100 yen coin
0.5;thought to have been placed next \Nto the body by the culprit.
0.5;There's also the park's swing set the \Ndying Momosaki-san indicated with blood.
0.5;The culprit and the victim \Nboth left separate messages.
0.5;we'd learn this was only \Nthe beginning of this case.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Target: MPD \NTransportation Department, Part Two!"""
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 781 \N""The Scarlet Intersection"""
0.5;Investigator Jodie's friend Shibuya Natsuko-san\Nwas attacked and rendered unconscious.
0.5;When we rushed to help, three \Nsuspects were called in, and...
0.5;Later, Bourbon and I determined \Nthe identity of the culprit.
0.5;Shibuya-sensei's condition has \Nworsened, and her life is in danger!
0.5;I'm surprised you knew I \Nregained consciousness.
0.5;It's partially my fault this happened, \Nso I asked them not to tell the school.
0.5;The information didn't make it down \Nto a lowly investigator like yourself.
0.5;I'd never tell him he \Nshot himself in the car.
0.5;Propelled forward by the \Nyears spent together.
0.5;Charging full speed ahead \Nwithout slowing the pace.
0.5;A suspicious pair have a \Ndangerous conversation!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;He didn't sweet talk any \Nsecrets out of you, did he?
0.5;A voice and disguise that \Ncould fool an acquaintance.
0.5;The Jodie-san I saw earlier \Nwas her disguised as you?
0.5;He tried to shake me by saying the info\Nhadn't reached a lowly investigator like me.
0.5;and let something slip\Nwhen Jodie-sensei showed up.
0.5;Everything's gone according to \NBourbon and Vermouth's plan.
0.5;It started with the e-mail you \Nreceived from Shibuya-sensei.
0.5;You said Shibuya-sensei didn't \Nremember sending that e-mail, right?
0.5;Then Bourbon probably sent it \Nfrom Shibuya-sensei's phone.
0.5;Stealing a phone from an FBI \Ninvestigator sounds difficult.
0.5;But taking a grade school teacher's \Nphone unnoticed was probably easy.
0.5;If he'd met with Shibuya-sensei \Nseveral times as a detective,
0.5;So you'd call Shibuya-sensei \Nusing Investigator Camel's phone.
0.5;If something happened to \NShibuya-sensei that night,
0.5;the investigator whose \Nnumber was in her history
0.5;and Jodie-sensei would \Nbe called to the scene.
0.5;From the beginning, they meant to get \Nintel from the agent who accompanied me.
0.5;But Natsuko was injured after Kandachi-san \Npushed her down the park stairs.
0.5;Either way, they meant \Nto injure her outdoors.
0.5;but that doesn't work for the \Noutfit you're wearing today.
0.5;It's easier to see and take pictures of you if\Nyou're outside than in a building or a car.
0.5;they called to say Shibuya-sensei took a turn\Nfor the worse, bringing you to the hospital.
0.5;They drew Camel's attention \Nto separate him from you.
0.5;So Vermouth, disguised as me, \Ncould get information out of you.
0.5;A patient involved in the case could \Nhave information for the police.
0.5;But they're only allowed to tell \Nrelatives about a patient's condition.
0.5;It was possible she was \Ndisguised as Shibuya-sensei.
0.5;It was about Kusuda Rikumichi, their \Nspy who infiltrated the hospital.
0.5;On the way here, Conan-kun drew my \Nattention to it, so it was on my mind.
0.5;If the man they thought was \Ncaptured by the FBI is dead,
0.5;But what does it matter if a man \Nwithout a code name shot himself?
0.5;Yes, leaving a clear bullet hole in \Nyour skull even if your body burned.
0.5;there was another man who was \Nshot in the head and burned.
0.5;The fingerprints from Akai's \Ncorpse that Kir shot in the head
0.5;at Raiha Pass, and burned\Nalong with his car,
0.5;matched Akai's fingerprints left \Non the detective boy's phone.
0.5;I see. But how did you get \Nfingerprints from a charred body?
0.5;Because he burned with his hand stuck inside \Nthe pocket of his flame retardant jacket.
0.5;When he shot me with a shotgun, \Nhe had one hand in his pocket.
0.5;But it's possible the hand was in the \Npocket so you'd find fingerprints later.
0.5;If you doubt me so much, would you like to \Nsee a video of the moment Akai was shot?
0.5;You mean the movie taken by the \Nhidden camera on Kir's neck?
0.5;Yes. You can clearly see \Nhim draw his last breath.
0.5;Even if I leave him, he should \Nonly last about thirty minutes.
0.5;Speaking as a fellow actor, \Nhe hadn't planned to say that.
0.5;But I'm disappointed you \Ndragged me into this farce.
0.5;I'll prove to you whether or not \NI'm right beyond any question.
0.5;But once I get a lead, it'll take \Nme less than a day to investigate.
0.5;He was sneaking around with \Nthe professor last night.
0.5;He called to say he was staying at the \Nprofessor's place so he didn't need dinner.
0.5;We were going to watch the \NMacademy Awards together...
0.5;Who cares about a foreign \Nfilm award ceremony?
0.5;But this isn't the first \Ntime we've met, is it?
0.5;I'm sorry, but could your \Nfriends wait outside?
0.5;But depending on your answers, \Nwe may all end up coming in.
0.5;We're going to the place \Nwhere they killed Akai-san?
0.5;That expression he made when he learned \Nthey'd learned Kusuda shot himself.
0.5;But the dead man touched that \Nphone after the thin man, right?
0.5;You think Okiya-san likes \Nthe Macademy Awards?
0.5;We came to watch Hado Rokumichi's \Nconcert rehearsal...
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills \Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;In the shadow of the case happening on the \Nstage lurk Amuro, Okiya, and Vermouth!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;the paper came from the notebook \Nthe victim used to write lyrics.
0.5;The handwriting matched the lyrics written \Non the other pages of the notebook.
0.5;Which means it's likely the \Nvictim felt indebted to someone,
0.5;I don't know about indebted, but he \Nmay have had an inferiority complex.
0.5;Hado often said he had \Nto work hard to keep up
0.5;with other handsome musicians \Nsince he had an off-putting face.
0.5;I said the way he seemed difficult \Nto approach was part of his charm.
0.5;Come to think of it, Hado-san \Nchanged his image recently.
0.5;That reminds me, there were \Nrumors Hado got plastic surgery.
0.5;Although I think that was around the \Ntime he graduated from high school.
0.5;We worked every day for \Na shipping company
0.5;to make enough money \Nfor him to be a musician.
0.5;But Hado dumped you after \Nyou worked so hard together,
0.5;"And the song ""ASACA"" he was \Nset to announce at this concert"
0.5;I heard Hado asked you \Nafter his previous concert,
0.5;"""Why didn't you say anything \Nfor seventeen years?"""
0.5;"Hado suddenly announced he'd be \Nreleasing his new song ""ASACA."""
0.5;I jokingly told him the real \Nreason I had him debut with us
0.5;But that doesn't sound like a \Nmotive to murder Hado-san.
0.5;Isn't it impossible for anyone \Nto have committed this crime?
0.5;except for the tip of his thumb \Nand the back of his hand.
0.5;You're the one who gave him \Nyour gun and made him do it,
0.5;It's dangerous for me to stay \Nhere very long while in disguise.
0.5;I need to get back to the office and \Nwrite an article about this case!
0.5;We need to check the \Ncontents of your bag first!
0.5;After viewing the images on the \Ncamera that was in your bag,
0.5;it looks like you were secretly taking photos \Nof Hado-san as he entered the concert hall,
0.5;but he discovered you and tried \Nto take away your camera.
0.5;One of the band members scheduled \Nto perform with Hado-san
0.5;at tomorrow's concert was just \Narrested by narcotics agents.
0.5;No, we didn't find anything \Nlike that on the stage.
0.5;The staff said both of those \Nwere missing from the tool box
0.5;Did the staff leave that folding \Nchair next to the tool box?
0.5;I just untied this, and \Nnow I have to retie it?
0.5;But he's taking it back along with \Nthe mic stand for further inspection.
0.5;The suspicious woman who tried to \Nkidnap Conan-kun and Ai-chan said...
0.5;Y-You know how the killer \Nlifted the victim's body?
0.5;but is one person really strong \Nenough to lift him out of the chair?
0.5;from the bar while standing \Nnext to the stage.
0.5;Wrap the bottom loop around \Nthe top loop two times.
0.5;pass the section hanging \Ndown through the loop.
0.5;Hook the resulting large loop \Nonto the armrest of the seat
0.5;Create the same loops as before \Nand pass the rope through.
0.5;on the armrest of a chair \Nabout four meters away.
0.5;Now all you have to do is return \Nto the third set of small loops
0.5;Sonoko-san, you seem like \Nthe weakest person here.
0.5;The small loops created along \Nthe rope function as pulleys.
0.5;Each set of loops doubles, \Nquadruples, and octuples
0.5;the strength isn't actually \Noctupled due to friction,
0.5;but if you use a light \Nand slippery enough rope,
0.5;In other words, the culprit used \Nnot the strength of several people,
0.5;Furthermore, this is \Nknown as a shipping knot.
0.5;Shipping workers use this \Nknot to secure cargo.
0.5;Which means the most likely suspect \Nwho lifted Hado-san's body
0.5;is his manager who worked \Nfor a shipping company
0.5;I can see how she lifted him, but how \Ndid she tie the rope to the seats?
0.5;she temporarily secured the \Nrope by tying it to a nearby seat.
0.5;Then she wrapped a wire around the \Nrope leading upwards around here.
0.5;Once the rope coming from the \Nceiling is secured using the wire,
0.5;the remaining rope can be untied \Nand reattached to the seat,
0.5;The best part of the shipping knot \Nis that it can be untied easily
0.5;since it doesn't actually create any knots, \Nbut if it's done using a brand new rope,
0.5;That's why after retying \Nthe rope to the seat,
0.5;you cut the end using the \Nbox cutter in the tool box,
0.5;and left it coiled next to the tool \Nbox at the edge of the stage, right,
0.5;Shipping workers coil rope \Nby wrapping it like this.
0.5;since the space between the elbow and the \Nwrist is about the size of their foot.
0.5;the manager's feelings for \NHado turned into hate.
0.5;Hado-san was wearing contact lenses \Nto make his irises look larger.
0.5;and comparing it to the images \Nthe magazine reporter took today.
0.5;After supporting him for seventeen \Nyears, why did you have to kill him?
0.5;Where do you think we found \Nthe other circle lens?
0.5;It was under the folding chair \Nleft at the edge of the stage.
0.5;In other words, that chair had fallen \Nunder his feet after he was hanging.
0.5;There's also the baseball \Ntied to the kite string.
0.5;It was used to pass the rope over the \Nbar by tying the other end to the rope,
0.5;throwing the ball so that \Nthe kite string would pass
0.5;over the bar on the ceiling, \Nand pulling on the string.
0.5;but I doubt Enjo-san would have been able to \Nthrow the ball high enough to clear the bar.
0.5;Although Hado-san, known for his strong arm on \Nhis high school baseball team, is another story.
0.5;Then there's the note found \Nin Hado-san's breast pocket.
0.5;and she disguised it to look \Nlike a murder after finding him.
0.5;Were you worried about what \Nwe discussed the other day?
0.5;the freshly debuted Hado locked himself \Nin his studio and wrote music.
0.5;He stayed up so many nights \Nin a row, I thought he'd die.
0.5;When she came to stop him, she \Ncollapsed in front of the studio
0.5;At the hospital, she asked \Nme not to tell Hado about it.
0.5;he held onto it for seventeen years, \Nunable to write the lyrics.
0.5;he felt responsible and attempted to write \Nlyrics for the child and release the song.
0.5;"he left the message ""sorry"" \Nand chose to die instead."
0.5;But why was it necessary to \Nmake it look like murder?
0.5;"So I took his phone with the \Nmessage ""goodbye"" in his outbox"
0.5;What an idiot to make a woman \Ncry even after his death.
0.5;I crawled along the ground day \Nafter day looking for a story.
0.5;And now the story I've found is also \Nthe biggest scandal in Hado's career.
0.5;I like to think I understood \NHado better than anyone.
0.5;Even if you didn't ask me not \Nto, I wouldn't write about this.
0.5;Such an overly sentimental story \Ndoesn't suit a rock and roller.
0.5;Since he heard about the pregnancy at \Na morning café after an all-nighter,
0.5;"if it was a girl, he wanted \Nto call her ""Asaca,"""
0.5;But if you were good enough friends \Nfor him to tell you that story,
0.5;why did you turn on him and \Npush him towards retirement?
0.5;band member who was just \Narrested for possession?
0.5;You took my gun while pretending \Nto be thrown by me.
0.5;but before you shoot me, don't you \Nwant to hear what I have to say?
0.5;It's not possible to pull \Nthe trigger of a revolver
0.5;Like you, I'm a dog trying \Nto sink my teeth into them.
0.5;This cellphone that likely contained \Ndata on his family and friends.
0.5;The store's already packed \Nwith books we can't sell.
0.5;Finding a used book is a once \Nin a lifetime experience.
0.5;Someday these will pass into the \Nhands of the people looking for them.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Whistling Bookstore!"""

0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""The Darkness of the \NPrefectural Police, Part One!"""
0.5;Hey, this place you said \Nyou wanted to stop by...
0.5;We can't leave without stopping at \Nthe the Kawanakajima battlefield,
0.5;But, Dad, have you always \Nliked history that much?
0.5;Come to think of it, the other day \NOkino Yoko played Princess Yu,
0.5;the woman who fell in love with Yamamoto \NKansuke, general of Takeda's army,
0.5;Also, speaking of Nagano, \Nthere's Shinshu soba.
0.5;You know, the one they used in \Nthe battle named after a bird.
0.5;and lies in wait for insects to \Ncome out from the other side,
0.5;one part of Takeda's army \Nattacked Uesugi's forces
0.5;that had taken up position \Nin the mountains at night.
0.5;As they hurriedly descended \Nfrom the mountains,
0.5;the other half of his army \Nattacked and flanked them.
0.5;Supposedly Yamamoto Kansuke suggested \Nthis famous strategy to Takeda Shingen.
0.5;Of course, Uesugi Kenshin expertly saw \Nthrough this disappointing strategy,
0.5;No. We were canvassing the area, \Nso we stopped by on our way back.
0.5;Besides, Inspector Yamato \Nsaid he'd never been before.
0.5;Nagano Prefectural Police \NInspector Yamato Kansuke.
0.5;the number two of the Black \NOrganization that Haibara mentioned.
0.5;You'd better not be on a date with your \Nchildhood friend Uehara while you're on the clock.
0.5;We're on our way to the \Nhideout of a wanted robber.
0.5;We thought we'd pay our respects \Nto Shingen before we go.
0.5;Yeah. He was supposed to meet us \Nhere, but we haven't found him.
0.5;Anyway, if you're visiting \Nthe Kawanakajima battlefield,
0.5;Well, the investigation \Nmeeting isn't for a while.
0.5;The chief said my coffee's \Nbeen getting better.
0.5;You're not one to criticize \Nother people's faces.
0.5;First, this is the Kansuke Shrine where \NYamamoto Kansuke is said to have died.
0.5;Kansuke's servants stole \Nback several of the heads
0.5;of allied generals that were taken \Nby the enemy during the battle.
0.5;But since they were all covered in blood, \Nthey didn't know which was Kansuke's.
0.5;But when one of the heads matched up \Nperfectly with Kansuke's still armored body
0.5;that was left on the battlefield, \Nthey knew it was Kansuke's head.
0.5;with a name as similar as Yamato \NKansuke, it's only natural to be curious.
0.5;I hope he doesn't do anything \Nlike die recklessly
0.5;Of course, you don't seem like the \Ntype to be frustrated by failure.
0.5;Why don't we finish the tour by \Nseeing the Chikumagawa River?
0.5;Come to think of it, I think \Nthere's a poem about the river.
0.5;"conjure images of warriors in\Nthe water of the red river."""
0.5;It's unclear if this was a tributary \Nfeeding the Chikumagawa River,
0.5;but over a thousand men are said to have \Ndied in the battle of Kawanakajima.
0.5;But Asai Retsu wrote this \Npoem based on the legend...
0.5;...that the river in front of the shrine turned \Nred with the blood of the fallen warriors,
0.5;for three days and nights \Nto put their souls to rest.
0.5;Since the battle, the river has been \Nknown as Akagawa, the Red River,
0.5;and the shrine has been \Nknown as Akagawa Shrine.
0.5;There's no way a river could \Nturn red for three days and...
0.5;This is Nagano Prefectural Police\NSection One Inspector,
0.5;Unfortunately, not only was it burned, \Nbut it's been slightly damaged as well.
0.5;Judging from the body, it was \Nburned over half a day ago.
0.5;So why did just the head come down the \Nriver from the bridge we were on earlier?
0.5;Maybe because it was hung \Nfrom the bridge's railing.
0.5;There's something that looks \Nlike a string hanging down.
0.5;The culprit probably put the head \Nand fake blood inside a plastic bag
0.5;and fall into the river after \Na certain amount of time.
0.5;He probably put rocks in \Nthe bag so it would sink.
0.5;We even heard a splashing \Nsound, so that must be it.
0.5;Real blood would have congealed and \Nwouldn't have flowed down the river.
0.5;I spotted it because I happened \Nto be looking at the river.
0.5;But otherwise, it would've just looked \Nlike trash floating down the river.
0.5;U-Um, there was an unnatural \Nbloodstain on his forehead.
0.5;When we sprayed luminol \Non it, a strange mark...
0.5;Woodpeckers need feet that allow \Nthem to cling tightly to trees.
0.5;Whoever did it must have\Nreally hated Takeda.
0.5;Though we can't be sure if \Nthis is really his body.
0.5;From the tip of his shoe that barely \Nsurvived the fire, we found his right big toe.
0.5;Come to think of it, wasn't the Takeda \NSquad supposed to take a warrant...
0.5;He wasn't at Hachiman Shrine where \Nwe supposed to meet him, either.
0.5;We didn't have a choice, so we entered \Nthe robber's house ourselves.
0.5;But he seemed to know we were coming, \Nbecause it was already empty.
0.5;After that, we split up to \Nlook for Squad Leader Takeda.
0.5;You don't think he ran ahead to \Nconfront the robber himself, do you?
0.5;He was willing to kill in \Norder to arrest a suspect.
0.5;Does anyone know what woodpeckers \Nmight have to do with Takeda?
0.5;Apparently there's a group in \Nthe Nagano Prefectural Police
0.5;When I told him I was an \Nex-cop, he clammed up.
0.5;He didn't speak very well \Nof the group, though.
0.5;I see. In any case, if he burned \Nthe body under this bridge,
0.5;Find anyone who may have a grudge \Nagainst Takeda because of a case.
0.5;Like Yamato said, if that woodpecker's \Nfootprint is a kill mark,
0.5;I'm sorry, but I'm going to have you go\Nwith Uehara and the others for a while.
0.5;You're the one of the people \Nwho discovered the body.
0.5;What? He was unconscious for \Nalmost ten years in the hospital?
0.5;Section One Chief Kuroda was apparently \Nin some kind of serious accident.
0.5;I see. No wonder he's been \Ntemporarily transferred at his age.
0.5;Yes. Normally you're transferred from the \NMPD to the local police when you're younger.
0.5;It probably had something \Nto do with the accident.
0.5;Apparently the nurse who removed the \Nbandages on his face was paralyzed with fear.
0.5;The stress from the accident \Nturned his jet black hair white.
0.5;Are you interested in the \Nsection chief, Conan-kun?
0.5;He looks like the head honcho \Nof some organization.
0.5;Yes. I reviewed all the cases Takeda-san \Nworked on the reference room computer.
0.5;The two cases in which Takeda-san shot \Nand killed the suspects stood out.
0.5;A man on drugs was shooting \Noff a gun in the city.
0.5;A man was holed up inside \Na bank with hostages.
0.5;They both died when Takeda \Nshot their brains out.
0.5;And both cases were submitted to \Nthe prosecutor with dead suspects.
0.5;Then maybe someone close to \Nthem resented him for it.
0.5;That's what I thought, but the parents \Nof the man who holed up in the bank
0.5;And the parents of the man who fired \Nthe gun nine years ago died of illness.
0.5;Come to think of it, did you see \Nany suspicious smoke or persons?
0.5;I thought that bridge was on your \Nrehabilitation course for your leg.
0.5;E-mail me if there are any \Ndevelopments in the case.
0.5;"Inspector Yamato called her \N""that grandma"" earlier."
0.5;Yeah. The man who fired a gun \Nin the city nine years ago
0.5;was actually one of Inspector \NYamato's childhood friends.
0.5;I remember him and Kan-chan often playing \Nuntil the sun set when they were kids.
0.5;It's because Takeda shot \Nand killed his friend.
0.5;Kansuke-kun was there at the scene \Nas a member of Takeda's squad.
0.5;Of course, since the incident had produced \Ncasualties, he said he was forced to shoot.
0.5;Saegusa's group discovered something \Nduring their canvassing.
0.5;This morning a witness saw someone who \Nlooked like Yamato near the bridge.
0.5;Rather, Inspector Yamato said \Nhe didn't go there this morning.
0.5;Kano-san said he was going home \Nbecause he noticed something.
0.5;He keeps spare copies of reports \Nof cases he's worked on at home.
0.5;since he received a number of \Nmissed calls from Kano-san,
0.5;Today's the day that shooting \Nhappened nine years ago.
0.5;You understand what I'm \Ntrying to say, don't you?
0.5;The god of war who will \Ndestroy the woodpecker.
0.5;You find surprising elements to help \Nsolve cases and back up his reasoning.
0.5;That's what they said about you \Nat the station, Edogawa Conan-kun.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The Darkness \Nof the Prefectural Police, Part Two!"""
0.5;You were looking forward to seeing \Nthe new movie starring Okino Yoko.
0.5;I don't mind that Okino Yoko-chan's \Nplaying a beautiful and talented lawyer.
0.5;But her boyfriend's a former police \Nofficer and incompetent detective,
0.5;who accidentally becomes \Na suspected murderer
0.5;and clears his name using \Nher detective skills.
0.5;"""You're the only one for \Nme!"" is what he cries"
0.5;as the detective clings to his girlfriend \Nin this moving love/mystery.
0.5;Maybe they based his \Ncharacter off the old man.
0.5;Besides, those movie tickets \Nare for premium seats.
0.5;She's definitely planning\Non showing up so she can tell me
0.5;to reflect on my mistakes like\Nthe detective in the movie.
0.5;Does that mean there are things \Nyou think you need to reflect on?
0.5;If more impertinent women \Nstart appearing in this world,
0.5;Maybe her secretary Kuriyama-san \Nsent a message as a joke.
0.5;Sounds like she was \Nkidnapped from her office.
0.5;They're probably not the \Nsame Eri-san you just added.
0.5;If the person using Eri's \Nusual icon is an impostor...
0.5;And the one without an \Nicon is the real Mom...
0.5;They changed from Eri's \Nusual cat icon to no icon!
0.5;There's something wrong \Nwith these phone messages.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Don't you have a movie date with \Nyour ex-husband after this?
0.5;I'm just going to see a movie because \Nmy daughter wouldn't stop pestering me.
0.5;You don't mind your stomach \Ngrowling in front of your clients,
0.5;but it bothers you if it's \Nin front of your husband.
0.5;Huh? We shouldn't have any \Nmore clients coming today.
0.5;I'll probably have to eat lunch in \Nthe car on the way to the theater.
0.5;Kisaki Eri, we're with \Nthe Victims Association.
0.5;Hey, what should we do with \Nthe unconscious secretary?
0.5;I'll head up there first and \Nhelp set up for the shoot.
0.5;Looks like I'll have to hide somewhere \Nin this abandoned building
0.5;If she escaped, then we now have the \Nopportunity to enjoy capturing her.
0.5;Come to think of it, the \Nother day Ran said...
0.5;The culprit hid a corpse inside \Na dresser in the zombie case.
0.5;so the body wouldn't be found \Neven if the drawers were opened.
0.5;Making this difficult isn't \Nin your best interest.
0.5;The drawers are sticking out \Na bit, but I was able to hide.
0.5;Next I'll use this phone I stole \Nfrom that man to contact the police.
0.5;And if she makes the slightest sound \Nwhile explaining her situation,
0.5;If I can't call anyone, \NI'll have to e-mail them.
0.5;Pretend to be the lawyer and \Njoin the chat to confuse them.
0.5;They changed from Eri's \Nusual cat icon to no icon!
0.5;Now we don't know which messages \Nare coming from the real Eri.
0.5;It's my fault for turning \Nit into a group chat.
0.5;and is contacting us from \Nwherever she's hiding.
0.5;No, I think it's better \Nto leave it like this.
0.5;But she doesn't know where \Nshe was taken, right?
0.5;So wouldn't it be better to keep chatting \Nwith the bad guys so they reveal themselves?
0.5;We don't even know if it's the real \NEri who's claiming she was kidnapped!
0.5;instead of Japanese commas in their \Ndocuments when writing horizontally.
0.5;That habit shows up in \Ntheir normal writing, too.
0.5;The messages I received from Mom \Nbefore all have Western commas.
0.5;"Then check the ""I've been kidnapped"" \Nmessage you received first."
0.5;Okay. I'm going to call the police \Nand have them check her office.
0.5;Looks like she knows which \Nmessages are mine.
0.5;"""Like the Toto Tower or the Metropolitan \NGovernment office building?"""
0.5;If she answers that, the bad guys \Nmight figure out where she's hiding.
0.5;We don't even know if her hiding \Nplace has windows to the outside.
0.5;That's why I doubt Kisaki-sensei \Nwill answer, but the bad guys might.
0.5;"""I can see the government office building, \Nbut I can't see the Toto Tower."""
0.5;I see. So they're someplace \Nwhere the Toto Tower is visible.
0.5;The bell of the church near the \Ndetective agency will ring soon.
0.5;If you can hear it from where you are, could \Nyou tap your phone with your fingernail twice?
0.5;Sound travels at about 340 meters per \Nsecond, and there's practically no wind today.
0.5;Come to think of it, this has \Nhappened a bunch of times.
0.5;Don't. I need to focus on \Nrescuing Mom right now.
0.5;Kuriyama-san just seems to have \Nbeen knocked out with a stun gun.
0.5;Maybe she's using the phone she \Nstole to call her daughter.
0.5;they can't use cell towers \Nto determine our location.
0.5;Besides, you removed the \NSIM card from her phone
0.5;More importantly, apparently the \Ndaughter asked what she could see.
0.5;she's hiding in a closed space where \Nshe can't see out any windows.
0.5;So we need to search all the lockers \Nand drawers in this building.
0.5;"""The crab's only half-boiled, but as a \Nresult, the two swordfish look delicious."""
0.5;"""Since it's light out tonight, \Nwhy don't we eat outside?"""
0.5;we'll just capture her and skin \Nher along with her mother.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""Counselor Kisaki's SOS, Part Two!"""
0.5;Dragged along by Ran, Sonoko, and \NSera so they could buy new swimsuits
0.5;to go to the pool, I arrived \Nat the department store.
0.5;The victim was cosmetics company \Npresident Sashihara Ritsuko-san.
0.5;The index finger and thumb on the \Nbody's left hand were extended,
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""The Blind Spot in the \NChanging Room, Part Two!"""
0.5;The order in which \NSashihara-sama, Yamaki-sama,
0.5;She said she'd forgotten where \Nthe changing rooms were,
0.5;so I showed her the way \Nto the front of the rooms.
0.5;I believe they were already in \Nfront of the room on the right.
0.5;She entered quite a while \Nafter Sashihara-sama,
0.5;and was irritated that none \Nof the rooms were freeing up.
0.5;According to Conan-kun, Sashihara-san \Nsaid something rather harsh to you.
0.5;she'd been told the same thing \Nbefore and not to worry about it.
0.5;that made it sound like you \Nmet for the first time today.
0.5;She was here with Yamaki-sama when \NNitsuka-sama collapsed in the changing room.
0.5;Are the black pumps you're \Nwearing and those white sneakers
0.5;If you think I'm lying, \Nyou can search the store.
0.5;Nanbu-san, could you draw \Nthe white sandals you saw?
0.5;were already there when I \Nentered the changing room.
0.5;President Sashihara entered the \Nchanging room next to yours later.
0.5;are those boxes you had inside \Nyour bag a gift for someone?
0.5;Yes, for the president \Nof the department store.
0.5;President Sashihara told me to have \None of the employees give it to him.
0.5;Also, could you draw us a \Npicture of the white sandals?
0.5;I collapsed in the changing \Nroom here last week
0.5;because of the dog hair that \NSashihara woman left everywhere.
0.5;they found substantial quantities \Nof dog hair in the changing room.
0.5;Do you know when the owner \Nof the white sandals
0.5;That dog-hair-covered \Nwoman was in the middle,
0.5;So you knew the victim \Nentered the middle room?
0.5;Maybe you made those slippers \Nlook like white sandals...
0.5;All three of them are \Nalmost exactly the same.
0.5;It seems there really was a \Ncustomer wearing white sandals.
0.5;But I still don't know how they \Nentered the victim's changing room
0.5;those disposable ones so your makeup \Ndoesn't get on the merchandise.
0.5;You can't see very well \Nwhen you're wearing one.
0.5;A lot of stores keep them \Nin the rooms themselves.
0.5;in front of the right changing \Nroom at the time of the murder.
0.5;who was using the left \Nroom before the victim
0.5;Or the woman allergic to \Ndogs, Nitsuka Tomoyo-san,
0.5;The question is how did the killer \Nget inside the changing room.
0.5;The victim would've said something if \Nsomeone entered while she was changing.
0.5;The killer's reflection should've \Nappeared in this mirror.
0.5;Using one of the face covers on the \Nright side of the changing room.
0.5;but female customers wear them when trying \Non clothes so their makeup doesn't get on them.
0.5;the victim knocked herself out \Nfor the killer by putting on one.
0.5;Actually, I didn't know \Nabout face covers either.
0.5;You melt one end of a \Nstraw using a hair iron,
0.5;To use it, you just have to cut \None end open with scissors.
0.5;So that's what the straw and scissors \Nwe found near the crime scene were for.
0.5;the killer had to know which changing \Nroom the victim would enter.
0.5;She'd enter the middle room \Nif it were the only one free.
0.5;Yeah. The killer made her \Nfirst attempt last week.
0.5;Nitsuka-san entered the \Nroom before the victim.
0.5;In other words, this was her \Nsecond attempt at murder.
0.5;By putting the white sandals \Nin front of the other room.
0.5;This could only have been \Ndone by the woman
0.5;Besides, the sandals were there \Nbefore I entered the changing room!
0.5;Cross the ribbon on the underside \Nof the insole and tape it.
0.5;Tape the ends to the \Nunderside again and there.
0.5;Wouldn't it be obvious since \Nthey're so flat and heel-less?
0.5;But if you raise the heel by \Nplacing a cell phone under them...
0.5;If you made the sandals beforehand \Nand kept them in your bag,
0.5;all that would be left after the murder \Nwould be the tape you used to make the sandals.
0.5;and you could hide the insoles \Ninside your own shoes.
0.5;The bits of tape we found \Nwith the straw and scissors
0.5;Her fingerprints may be on the tape since \Nit's difficult to remove without bare hands.
0.5;After making sure the three \Nchanging rooms were empty,
0.5;you placed the white sandals in \Nfront of the room on the right,
0.5;told an employee you forgot \Nwhere the changing rooms were,
0.5;soaked a face cover in the \Nchloroform you had in the straw,
0.5;put it back in the box, \Nand entered the left room.
0.5;You watched through the curtain \Nfor the victim to enter
0.5;and listened for the victim \Nto inhale the chloroform
0.5;wrapped the rope you brought \Naround the victim's neck,
0.5;Then you waited for Nitsuka-san, who was \Nfrequently checking the changing rooms,
0.5;listened for Nitsuka-san \Nto enter the right room,
0.5;removed the ribbon from the white \Nsandals, tied it around the present,
0.5;You intended to leave the \Nchanging room immediately,
0.5;but an employee found the \Nvictim's body first, right?
0.5;Then what were those shapes the \Nvictim made with her hands?
0.5;The right hand grasping her \Nthumb with lipstick on it was...
0.5;The victim was wearing nails \Nwith five stars on them,
0.5;she was trying to make it \Nlook like the Chinese flag.
0.5;Chinese people count on their \Nfingers in an unusual way.
0.5;I came here to buy clothes a few \Nmonths ago with the president.
0.5;Are you going to wear that \Nto the upcoming party?
0.5;But if you planned to wear it, \NI'll choose something else.
0.5;The president didn't wear \Nthose clothes herself.
0.5;With me and Conan-kun on the case, \Na case like that is a cinch.
0.5;I used to feel them right \Naround the back of my neck.
0.5;I guess I haven't tranquilized \NSonoko in a while.
0.5;Yeah, Mom tried to act cool \Nby mimicking French people.
0.5;No. I saw on TV that even in \NEurope, there are exceptions.
0.5;They count to three using \Ntheir pointer finger,
0.5;Maybe she was thinking of cricket \Nsince that's popular in England.
0.5;Cricket bats are flatter and \Nthicker than baseball bats.
0.5;And according to American manners, \Nafter cutting your food with a knife,
0.5;That's how I know Conan-kun's \Npretty good at football.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NDetective Boys and the Haunted House!"""
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 766 ""Teimuzu \NRiver Kite Flying Case (Part 2)"""
0.5;I think it was one of \NOkino Yoko-chan's songs.
0.5;I did, of course, but she \Nsaid it was a secret.
0.5;It's probably some dumb song \Nthat's popular right now.
0.5;During the kite flying event, a man on the \Nneighboring team fell into the Teimuzu River.
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;You think I drew Renno-san to an area \Nwithout a rope and made him fall into the river?
0.5;But we don't know if \NRenno-san heard his voice.
0.5;The people around them were shouting \Ninstructions to their teammates, too.
0.5;Even if he couldn't hear you, you \Ncould still guide him using gestures.
0.5;you can watch the video the event operators \Ntook to make sure no one was cheating.
0.5;Because I noticed while watching the other \Nkites that the wind seemed stronger higher up.
0.5;I thought we could send our kite \Nshooting up by standing far apart.
0.5;Each team had a limited amount of time to \Nfly their kite, so we had to get it in one try.
0.5;By the way, what's your \Nrelationship with Renno-san?
0.5;I'm an employee at the \Ncafé Renno-san manages.
0.5;I came today so we could win our class \Nevent using a kite with our café's logo.
0.5;The winners' kites are displayed at \Ncity hall, so it's good advertising.
0.5;We'd have pride when we attended\Nneighborhood association meetings, too.
0.5;Yeah, Renno and I talked a little \Njust before he fell into the river.
0.5;He had a relationship with my \Nsister even though he had a wife.
0.5;He drove her to attempt suicide, so I asked \Nto speak with him after the event.
0.5;Then you had motive to make \NRenno-san fall into the river.
0.5;He'd been in love with my \Nsister since high school.
0.5;about him and my sister, must've \Nhad plenty of motive, too.
0.5;Is it true Renno-san was speaking to \Nhis wife on the phone the whole time?
0.5;wouldn't his wife have \Nheard me over the phone?
0.5;I doubt anyone would listen \Nto the advice of a rival.
0.5;But you saw Renno-san fall \Ninto the river, right?
0.5;I thought he had approached \Nthe river to litter.
0.5;He was carrying an empty \Nplastic bottle under his arm.
0.5;By the way, what is your \Nrelationship with them?
0.5;Renno and Yatsukoshi were my juniors \Non our high school baseball team.
0.5;That's how I know Yatsukoshi even \Nthough he's younger than me.
0.5;I was speaking to him over the phone \Nfrom home using my house phone!
0.5;But the person he was \Nspeaking to on the phone
0.5;is the only one who could have \Nled him between the posts.
0.5;If you lived in a tall apartment building \Nand could see this area from there.
0.5;But if you were video chatting, \Nyou could see a little bit,
0.5;Listen, if his wife at home \Ntold him over the phone
0.5;to go farther back or move \Na little to the left,
0.5;Did you hear Kakura-san's \Nvoice through the phone?
0.5;Yes. He's the brother of my \Nhusband's mistress, isn't he?
0.5;I already knew my husband was having \Nan affair with his sister, though.
0.5;I did hear some rustling as my \Nhusband was doing something, though.
0.5;Could he have received \Nan e-mail from someone?
0.5;He had a call on the line. He \Ncouldn't view his messages.
0.5;I threatened to divorce \Nhim if he hung up on me.
0.5;Just like he said, Yatsukoshi-san's \Nnot making any overt movements.
0.5;We can see Kakura-san just after \NRenno-san fell into the river.
0.5;I can't imagine he led Renno-san \Nbetween the posts.
0.5;Then that leaves only \Nhis wife who called him.
0.5;That would mean the culprit may be\Nsomeone other than those three.
0.5;I dropped it in front of the \Nbathrooms, and someone picked it up.
0.5;At first it rang a few times \Nbefore the call ended.
0.5;and we couldn't reach it no \Nmatter how many times we called.
0.5;Since it's off, we can't \Nlook for it by GPS, either.
0.5;Do you remember anyone who was \Nstanding nearby when you dropped it?
0.5;Someone tripped behind me, \Nbut I didn't see their face.
0.5;That's why I think they mistook it \Nfor their own and took it with them.
0.5;Professor, what time was \Nit when you first called?
0.5;Because of the incident, I had \Nforgotten all about your phone.
0.5;We've been telling you, it was impossible \Nfor any of us to make Renno fall in the river!
0.5;Like you said, it's possible someone \Nmanipulated the rope between those posts.
0.5;But just because my husband was \Nbacking up while holding a kite...
0.5;None of us could have led him between the \Nposts and made him fall into the river.
0.5;But the rope seems to have been \Nmanipulated quite recently.
0.5;I can only imagine it was done to \Nmake Renno-san fall into the river.
0.5;How do you think we led \NRenno-san between the posts?
0.5;but when he fell, I was far enough \Naway that he couldn't hear me.
0.5;You didn't see me make any \Ngestures to guide him, did you?
0.5;his wife on the phone \Nwould have heard it, too.
0.5;I was on the phone with \Nmy husband until he fell,
0.5;but it wasn't possible for me \Nto guide my husband from home!
0.5;They may have been able to do it \Nif they had psychic powers, though.
0.5;F-For today, you can leave after \Nwe conduct a pat-down search.
0.5;Once Renno-san regains consciousness, \Nwe'll know immediately who did it.
0.5;Maybe he'll even tell us how \Nthey led him between the posts.
0.5;Speaking of which, Conan-kun, \Ndid you find your phone?
0.5;Maybe whoever picked it up \Nthrew it away somewhere.
0.5;It would be terrible if they \Nthrew it into the river.
0.5;It'll have recorded the voice \Nof whoever picked it up.
0.5;What are you going to do if they \Ntake it home and destroy it?
0.5;I had the professor install a \Nspecial transmitter in the phone.
0.5;We'll know exactly where it is once \Nwe check the computer at his house.
0.5;It's a four digit code you \Nguys will never crack.
0.5;"Is it ""this is Conan"" \Nwritten in numbers as 5794?"
0.5;"Since you're the ""Kaito Kid Killer,"" \Nit must be his criminal number 1412."
0.5;I'll have to take it home \Nand smash it with a hammer.
0.5;It has a different PIN, and I thought \NI hadn't brought mine today,
0.5;The person who plotted to make \NRenno-san fall into the river...
0.5;I told you, it wasn't possible for me to\Nlead Renno-san between the posts!
0.5;How could I have guided Renno-san \Nwithout any overt gestures
0.5;when he was standing so far \Naway he couldn't hear me?
0.5;We found all the materials \Nfor a string phone.
0.5;A long string to connect the two people \Nand plastic bottles to use as receivers.
0.5;H-How could I tell him to use a string \Nphone if he couldn't hear me?
0.5;Like using the string phone when you \Npulled twice on the kite string.
0.5;He did tell me to hold on and moved \Nthe phone away from his face.
0.5;Because you put my phone in your breast \Npocket, I was able to record everything.
0.5;A voice pattern profile would reveal \Nwhose voice it is immediately.
0.5;It seems Renno-san just \Nregained consciousness.
0.5;He's the reason we were \Nable to solve the case.
0.5;Yoko-chan, we have a special \Nvideo message from someone.
0.5;There's a song I often listen to while warming\Nup, though I won't tell you whose it is.
0.5;This bearded old man actually \Nlistens to idol songs.

0.5;The deceased is\NHida Mitsuhiro-san, 53.
0.5;The cause was potassium\Ncyanide-induced suffocation.
0.5;He died some time\Nbetween 7:00 and 7:30 p.m.
0.5;And the fact that the windows\Nwere locked from the inside
0.5;means this was an impossible\Ncrime and a locked-room murder!

0.5;Like when he counts\Nmoney or something...
0.5;Now that you mention it,\Nhe always spread the bills like a fan
0.5;and then licked\Nhis right thumb like so.
0.5;As Detective Mori said, poison was\Nfound on the victim's right thumb
0.5;However, the poison on the\Nbills was shaped like his thumbprint,
0.5;so it was likely his\Nthumb that put it there...
0.5;That's the coffee I gave him\Njust before I left for the day.
0.5;You probably smeared poison\Nall over the cup handle!

0.5;But if a borrower isn't gonna repay,\Nhe shouldn't borrow at all.
0.5;You found no poison\Nanywhere in the office?!
0.5;It was potassium cyanide\Nthe victim touched.
0.5;It can't be wiped cleanly away\Non such short notice.
0.5;Which means it's\Non one of you three!
0.5;I'll have to ask each of you\Nto empty your pockets.
0.5;A wallet, watch, house key, notebook,\Ntrain pass, and handkerchief.
0.5;Huh? Say, that person's been\Nlike that this whole time...
0.5;You said you checked everything\Nthe victim might've touched, right?
0.5;Yeah! I thought it\Nwas strange, myself!
0.5;They're gonna get mad\Nif you poke around there!
0.5;The spill-off is fresh!\NThe killer used this!
0.5;and the time they\Nentered the restroom!
0.5;They manipulated and poisoned\Nthe victim in this otherwise empty office!
0.5;Yes. The killer's aim\Nwas a locked-room murder.
0.5;Ran. Return to my office and\Nget the iodine from the first-aid kit.
0.5;The killer got the victim to leave\Nthe room halfway through his counting
0.5;and got him to touch\Nsomething with poison on it.
0.5;It was after he returned and locked\Nthe door that he was poisoned.
0.5;The killer used the victim's\Nhabit of licking his right thumb
0.5;In which case, the killer was\None of you three employees
0.5;who knew of his habit\Nand what he was doing tonight.
0.5;Hold on! No poison was\Nfound outside this room!
0.5;Besides, how did the killer\Nget him to touch it?
0.5;A certain something would make\N10 out of 10 people do the same thing.
0.5;Anyone would pick up\Na ringing phone!
0.5;I bet you called from outside so he'd\Npick up your poison-covered phone!
0.5;Yet, when he came to get his phone,\Nhe picked it up with his bare hands.
0.5;Had there been poison, he'd have\Nbeen too afraid to do such a thing
0.5;because there'd be no telling\Nwhere it had been touched.
0.5;Iino-san! You had him turn it on\Nto check some data, didn't you?!
0.5;There was a way to make him\Ntouch something with his right thumb
0.5;The demonic call the killer\Nused to lead him to his death!
0.5;The killer put poison\Non the knob here!
0.5;Gas stoves on the market are\Nusually for right-handers.
0.5;Poison left on the left side of the\Nknob would be touched by a thumb.
0.5;As proof, only this door's\Ninside knob had poison on it.
0.5;Which means he rushed out\Nwithout closing the door,
0.5;touched the poison\Nin his flustered state,
0.5;So who used that trick\Nto poison the president?!
0.5;The only one who got\Nnear the stove afterwards...
0.5;Yes. Just before you left,\Nyou put the teapot on the stove
0.5;so the whistle would sound\Nwhile he was counting the money.
0.5;You planned to wipe\Nthe poison away tomorrow,
0.5;but his body was found earlier\Nthan expected and the police showed up.
0.5;Afraid the poison on the\Nstove knob would be discovered,
0.5;you entered the break room and\Nwiped it off with your handkerchief.
0.5;How's that? You said yourself it\Ncouldn't be wiped away so soon.
0.5;Yes, it is impossible. Assuming\Nit was an ordinary handkerchief.
0.5;Now, then, Inspector. Please put\Nsome iodine on her damp handkerchief.
0.5;A single drop will shed\Nlight on everything!
0.5;It's just going to\Nmake a brown stain...
0.5;Yes. Soaked into her handkerchief\Nis neither water nor sweat!
0.5;A bleach used to remove color\Nfrom disinfectants like iodine.
0.5;It's also an antidote that neutralizes\Nthe effects of potassium chloride!
0.5;There's still some\Nin the restroom cabinet!
0.5;After the police found out,\NFujii-san likely went straight to the restroom
0.5;and soaked her\Nhandkerchief in the bleach.
0.5;I can't believe I was\Nfound out so quickly.
0.5;That's right. I killed\Nthat devious money-fiend.
0.5;then hung himself\Nwhen he couldn't pay it back.
0.5;But you were always saying\Nhow borrowing money is wrong!
0.5;Yeah. I wouldn't have\Nbothered with revenge
0.5;had he borrowed money for a car,\Na house, or gambling,
0.5;but it was for my sake,\Nso I had no choice.
0.5;and I was in the hospital between my\Ncollege graduation and three years ago.
0.5;My parents died early on and I had\Nno friends because of my attitude,
0.5;He said he'd pay the\Nhospital bills somehow.
0.5;When I finally got better\Nand went to his apartment,
0.5;I found him dead with a\NHida Financial loan form at his feet.
0.5;So you joined the\Ncompany to get revenge?!
0.5;Yep. I waited for my\Nchance this whole time.
0.5;But, Detective.\NHow did you know I did it?
0.5;That'd be because of the left hand\Nyou kept in your coat the entire time.
0.5;You used your left hand\Nonly once to turn the stove knob.
0.5;You're a heavy smoker.\NYou touch your lips when you smoke.
0.5;Afraid of that, you purposely\Nturned the knob with your left hand.
0.5;so you wouldn't accidentally\Nsmear the poison on anything.
0.5;And to think my man\Ngot me to stop smoking...
0.5;He must be laughing\Nin the next world...
0.5;Nobody'll play with me 'cuz it\Nreminds them of what happened.
0.5;So you bring a kid with you\Nto play Strip Mahjong?
0.5;A riichi, ippatsu tsumo,\Nhon-itsu, and four doras!
0.5;Even an ura-dora!\NHurray! A sanbaiman!
0.5;Who in the world\Ntaught you Mahjong?
0.5;Kaitou #1412, who toys with\Npolice the country over...
0.5;This is insane! No one can\Njust disappear like that!
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 993 ""Kyogoku \NMakoto the Understudy (Part One)"""
0.5;Thanks to you, Case Closed \Nhas been airing for 25 years.
0.5;We'll work together again this year \Nto produce an entertaining product.
0.5;No matter the time or place, I, \NYaiba, shall defend justice...
0.5;Superhero Team Azengers \Nwas as good as they say.
0.5;although I was a little dumbfounded by \NKamen Yaiba's reason for joining them.
0.5;"After all, it was, ""We want to \Nincrease our Japanese audience."""
0.5;If that movie were real, I bet \Nthey'd recruit Makoto-san first.
0.5;I think Ran-kun and I \Nwould be pretty good, too.
0.5;When you think about it, \Nit really is a waste.
0.5;After all, you're Kanto's \Nstrongest karate practitioner.
0.5;And a young martial artist with \Na 400-0 undefeated record.
0.5;But you're just watching movies \Nand strolling around town.
0.5;You can't expect incidents to \Noccur at your own convenience.
0.5;I expect you to fulfill the \Nthree demands I'm about to list.
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!
0.5;Solving mysteries at a \Nfilming location with Sera!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Well, we were just watching \Nthat kind of movie.
0.5;It's your fault for not \Nkeeping an eye on the crowd.
0.5;I didn't think anyone would come running \Nfrom the other side of the street.
0.5;Since the role involves \Nwearing a full face helmet,
0.5;But finding an actor who can do action \Nscenes on such short notice will be difficult.
0.5;Now that I get a better look \Nat you, you're pretty fit.
0.5;Was that something special \Nthat you did earlier?
0.5;Anyway, I was hoping I could get \Nthis famous actress' autograph.
0.5;It produces an electrical current \Nwhen you press the button.
0.5;I bet you're the one who planted that whoopee \Ncushion on my chair in the makeup room.
0.5;It's what you get for leaving \Nthose things lying around.
0.5;He might be talking about \Nyour false eyelashes.
0.5;When two of them get stuck together, \Nthey look like a centipede.
0.5;Isn't it kind of pathetic for \Nyou to be scared of bugs?
0.5;It's like you don't even realize \Nyou're a famous actress.
0.5;This only happened because \Nhe jumped to conclusions.
0.5;Have we actually unearthed an \Nunbelievable diamond in the rough?
0.5;Maybe I'll scout him to play \Na new police detective.
0.5;It's about time your character \Ndied in the line of duty.
0.5;But even we could handle \Nthose fight scenes, right?
0.5;In that case, maybe I'll have one \Nof you do Jinmei-chan's stunts.
0.5;That's why it doesn't matter \Nmuch if they swap one out.
0.5;But doesn't that mean I might eventually \Nbecome the wife of an action star?
0.5;That's where the carpenter flipped \Nhis toolbox over earlier.
0.5;This is why the previous \NAD died in an accident.
0.5;And give some thought to playing \Nthe new police detective.
0.5;I'll explain how the safety \Ntether works later.
0.5;He's supposed to kick our \Nfuture star off the building.
0.5;He said he couldn't find \Nhis main girl's phone.
0.5;He's probably already up there talking \Nto his main girl on the phone.
0.5;He keeps a different phone for each girl \Nbut leaves them lying around all the time.
0.5;Come to think of it, he asked me \Nearlier if I'd seen his phone.
0.5;Because I just filmed a fight scene \Nwith the culprit on the fourth floor.
0.5;If you yell too much, your \Nfake wounds will come apart.
0.5;The deceased is actor Tokuzono \NSaiya-san, 34 years old.
0.5;the only person on the fourth \Nfloor with him was you,
0.5;Tokuzono-san came in while I was \Nvisualizing the action scene by myself.
0.5;But I think I heard a strange \Nnoise other than a ringtone.
0.5;There's no way Makoto-san \Nwould do something like that!
0.5;Do you have any idea what \Ncould have made the noise?
0.5;We'd finished filming the \Nscenes inside the classroom.
0.5;All we had left to film \Nwas the culprit falling
0.5;from the fourth floor shot \Nfrom inside the schoolyard.
0.5;Could Tokuzono-san have accidentally fallen \Nwhile playing around with his harness?
0.5;He was looking for a phone \Nthat was important to him.
0.5;Although it is true that he \Nfrequently pulled childish pranks.
0.5;Hideka-chan, you've been his \Nvictim a few times, right?
0.5;He often pranked me with jack-in-the-boxes \Nand whoopee cushions.
0.5;The AD who fell for it \Nscreamed like he was dying.
0.5;It made everyone in the studio \Ngather in the bathroom.
0.5;He got into a car accident on \Nhis way to a filming location.
0.5;But weren't there staff members who \Nresented Tokuzono-san for his pranks?
0.5;And actors who quit after getting \Ninto arguments about it.
0.5;Tokuzono-chan himself was \Ntrying to break the ice.
0.5;that guy playing the culprit got into an \Nargument with Tokuzono-san just before he fell.
0.5;In any case, let's head to \Nthe fourth floor classroom.
0.5;After a fight, the culprit is kicked \Nout the window in this scene.
0.5;Could you call the last number the \Nvictim called using his phone?
0.5;Isn't it possible that something made \Nhim drop it there after he found it?
0.5;But look. There isn't a \Nscratch on this phone.
0.5;It was carefully placed there by \Nsomeone other than Tokuzono-san.
0.5;Because of us, we now know that someone \Nmay have used this phone to do something.
0.5;After Tokuzono-san entered the classroom \Nand said he'd call his phone,
0.5;That narrows down the time \Nwhen the phone was placed.
0.5;We filmed the fight scene \Nin the classroom first.
0.5;So anyone could've taken advantage of that \Nto leave the phone outside the window.
0.5;so nobody was keeping an eye \Non the window from the outside.
0.5;Sounds like we should ask who \Nwas last to leave the classroom.
0.5;Please don't pick anything up until \Nforensics has a chance to examine the room.
0.5;What? Who left the fourth \Nfloor classroom last?
0.5;People were eating their \Nlunches all over the place.
0.5;From down here, the fourth \Nfloor is a blind spot.
0.5;to return to the fourth floor \Nduring that break and lay a trap.
0.5;Come to think of it, Jinmei-chan, you \Nwere oddly short of breath earlier.
0.5;Though it would make sense if you ran \Nup to the fourth floor at that time.
0.5;I haven't done an action scene \Nin a while, and I'm out of shape.
0.5;In any case, someone placed the phone \Noutside the window during the break
0.5;and when Tokuzono-san and Kyogoku-san \Nreturned to the fourth floor.
0.5;It's possible they were lurking nearby in \Norder to retrieve whatever trap they set.
0.5;Is there anyone who was \Nmissing during that time?
0.5;I was looking through the \Ncamera to check the angle.
0.5;Only four people besides \NRan-san's group are visible.
0.5;Anyway, what are we going \Nto do about the shoot?
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is, ""Kyogoku \NMakoto the Understudy, Part Two!"""
0.5;Kyogoku-san accidentally knocked \Nout a stuntman filming a TV drama.
0.5;He was recruited to fill \Nin for the stuntman, but...
0.5;While filming, actor Tokuzono-san \Nfell to his death.
0.5;The police arrived, and as their \Ninvestigation progressed...
0.5;This is an inappropriate time \Nfor me to laugh about the past.
0.5;Only four people besides \NRan-san's group are visible.
0.5;Three high school girls demonstrate \Ntheir mystery-solving skills!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;And if we can't figure that out, \Nwe can't make any progress.
0.5;Shinichi-niichan is a high \Nschool student, so he's tall.
0.5;Yeah, that's what an ordinary \Nperson would think.
0.5;And I believed the key \Nto solving that mystery
0.5;If you refuse to admit it, \Nthen it can't be helped.
0.5;Is there a kid who hangs out with Conan-kun \Nwho seems mature for their age?
0.5;Mitsuhiko knows a lot for a \Nfirst-year grade school student.
0.5;He certainly seems smart, but \Nhe's not as smart as you, is he?
0.5;You were nearby when Odori-san was \Npoisoned and collapsed, right?
0.5;Could you give the Inspector a \Ndetailed account of the incident?
0.5;He wants to confirm if \NOdori-san poisoned himself.
0.5;So, do you know any other kinds who \Nare strangely mature for their age?
0.5;First Mitsuhiko-kun was sneezing earlier, \Nand now you're sneezing, Ai-kun?
0.5;I wish I could've gone to see \Na movie with Conan-kun, too.
0.5;Apparently Kamen Yaiba \Nis teaming up with them.
0.5;Sonoko-san was going on a date at the \Nsame time, so it couldn't be helped.
0.5;They used to be famous for their \Ncheap but effective medicines.
0.5;It happened because a larger \Ncompany attempted to acquire them,
0.5;But the company went bankrupt, and my \Nparents were forced to become GPs instead.
0.5;That same group kept trying to recruit \Nthem even after they became GPs.
0.5;I'm actually curious to \Nknow what happened next.
0.5;At that lab, my parents were \Nforced to create the drug
0.5;They intended to discuss who'd \Nfill in for Tokuzono-san,
0.5;but because I interrupted them, \Nthey tabled the discussion.
0.5;I need to keep an eye on them so Sera \Ndoesn't ask any weird questions.
0.5;Odori-san received a message \Non his phone, though.
0.5;What? But there wasn't a phone \Namong Odori-san's belongings.
0.5;But I'm pretty sure the footage of Tokuzono-san's \Nfall captured Odori-san holding a phone.
0.5;I left the cap off, so \Nit won't write anymore.
0.5;Tokuzono-chan fell from the fourth floor \Nbecause of a practical joke device.
0.5;Since poison wasn't found \Nin Odori-san's shake or cup,
0.5;He felt responsible for the \Naccident and committed suicide.
0.5;and Hideka-chan and I need \Nto head to my gravure shoot.
0.5;If they're allowed to leave, \Nthey'll destroy the evidence.
0.5;Apparently a TV station producer wants \Nto talk to him about his acting debut.
0.5;Sera-chan seems distracted, so why don't \NI solve this serial murder case instead?
0.5;When Detective Mori isn't \Naround, he uses her.
0.5;Could you keep people away from me so \Nthey can't interfere with my deduction?
0.5;First, there's actor Tokuzono-san's \Nfall to his death.
0.5;Everyone gathered to film the action \Nscene in the classroom where he fell.
0.5;The crew went on break, and everyone on \Nthe fourth floor returned to the first floor.
0.5;Later, Makoto-san headed up to the fourth \Nfloor ahead of the others for his stunt.
0.5;Tokuzono-san came to the \Nfourth floor before him.
0.5;It was placed outside the window \Nto lure Tokuzono-san out there.
0.5;From the beginning, the police assumed the \Nphone had been tampered with in some way.
0.5;If a loud ringtone were set to \Nsound when a certain number called,
0.5;But that number would remain \Nin the phone's call history,
0.5;was the quiet fluttering Makoto-san \Nheard on the fourth floor.
0.5;The practical joke device found in \NOdori-san's belongings flew then.
0.5;because it had to be place carefully \Non top of the butterfly.
0.5;But Tokuzono-san immediately \Nletting go of his phone,
0.5;which meant it remained \Nunscratched, was unexpected.
0.5;Since Odori-san was hiding it, \Ndoesn't that mean it was him?
0.5;The butterfly flew inside through \Nthe fourth floor window by chance.
0.5;Odori-san entered the classroom after \Nthe fall and secretly took it with him.
0.5;That's how he determined the \Nmethod used by the culprit.
0.5;Odori-san was killed because he tried to use \Nthat as evidence to threaten the culprit.
0.5;You're saying that not only \Nwas it not Odori-kun's prank,
0.5;but it also wasn't the \Nreason he killed himself?
0.5;While checking the footage of \NTokuzono-san's fall, Odori-san laughed.
0.5;Odori-san laughed because he saw \Na certain person from the footage.
0.5;Decisive evidence of the \Ntrue culprit's guilt.
0.5;There's someone behaving strangely \Neven though a person just fell.
0.5;Makeup artist Aburai Hideka-san, \Nyou're the culprit.
0.5;You were watching to see where \Nthe practical joke device went.
0.5;You intended to retrieve it while \Neveryone was distracted by Tokuzono-san.
0.5;No, but I feel like I heard \Nthe fluttering the whole time.
0.5;You decided to kill Odori-san \Nafter he threatened you.
0.5;Odori-san's phone was \Nmissing from his belongings
0.5;because you swiped it to \Nhide your conversation.
0.5;You can't expect me to sit \Nquietly and listen to this.
0.5;If Hideka-chan is the culprit, \Nthen how did she poison him?
0.5;She removed the straw's tip, \Nmade a vertical cut in it,
0.5;Aburai-san coated the cap \Nwith poison beforehand
0.5;and said she couldn't \Ntake her allergy medicine
0.5;Naturally, she had already confirmed that \Nthe nearby shop would have the right shake.
0.5;Then she pretended to help distribute \Ndrinks and swiped the straw she needed.
0.5;All that was left was to give \NOdori-san the straw with the cap.
0.5;After killing him, she waited for \Nan opportunity to remove the cap,
0.5;creating the mysterious murder in which \Nno poison would be found anywhere.
0.5;Aburai-san, did you take \Nyour allergy medicine?
0.5;It's dangerous to carry a poisoned \Ncap around against your bare skin.
0.5;If it were me, I'd roll it up \Nand hide it inside a capsule
0.5;And because you hid it \Namong the other capsules,
0.5;If that capsule were found, \Nthat would prove it was you.
0.5;It would be immediately \Nobvious if one had a cap.
0.5;It was insurance in case I failed to kill \NTokuzono-san using the practical joke device.
0.5;I was lucky that nobody found \Nthe straw type suspicious
0.5;because the director handed \NOdori-san his shake.
0.5;Tokuzono-san's prank reminded \Nhim of how he hurt Jinmei-san.
0.5;But the next day, he said he was \Nheading to the filming location.
0.5;He said he'd cause more trouble \Nif he didn't go and took his car.
0.5;I spent so much time wondering \Nif I should kill him.
0.5;I kept telling myself that more \Nthan one thing caused the accident.
0.5;After hearing those words \Ntoday, I made up my mind.
0.5;I had to make him apologize to \NNishibe-kun in the afterlife.
0.5;Is she trying to kill herself by \Ncrashing into the school building?
0.5;I was trying to kill myself \Nso I could join Nishibe-kun.
0.5;It's something I picked \Nup from my friend's mom.
0.5;He stopped a car from speeding \Ninto a building by himself.

0.5;That's it! That's definitely where\NShinmei-sensei is being held!
0.5;Shinmei-sensei also has dialogue\Nin the eighth chapter we just got!
0.5;If we don't hurry,\Nhe and his wife will be--!
0.5;...and use this Tranquilizer\NWristwatch to knock the old guy out!
0.5;Mori-san. Let me introduce you.\NThis is our chief editor...
0.5;Now to set the Voice-Changing\NBowtie to use his voice...
0.5;Wait a minute!\NI don't know what he sounds like!
0.5;This is bad!\NThere's only one tranquilizer dart!
0.5;I'll have to wait for them\Nto crack the code themselves.
0.5;If we don't hurry,\NShinmei-sensei will...!
0.5;What happened!\NPlease wake up, Chief! Chief!
0.5;"He's snoring. Almost reminds\Nme of ""Sleeping Kogoro."""
0.5;Humor? As always,\Nyou know strange words for a kid.
0.5;"They were saying\Nstuff about ""humour""! Right?"
0.5;He misspelled the word,\Nso I fixed it for him.
0.5;"If they don't say ""h,""\Nthey should remove it from the start!"
0.5;That reminds me, Shinmei-sensei's\Ncharacter lives in France, right?
0.5;Yes... the other key to\Nthis code might be the fact
0.5;"that ""h"" isn't pronounced\Nat the start of words in French."
0.5;Could it mean to remove the\Nh from ha, hi, hu, he, and ho?!
0.5;"If it means you have to drop the\N""h"" letter when combining letters,"
0.5;Using all of this to decipher\NMr. Shinmei's second scene...
0.5;"All together, it's ""watashi\Nga ima i ru tokoro wa""..."
0.5;Alright! When you decipher\Nthe third scene he's in, you get...
0.5;Kido City Hotel? What hotel is that?\NI've never heard of it.
0.5;It could be using\NHepburn romanization!
0.5;"And if you keep the first ""fu,""\Nit would combine to make ""hai."""
0.5;Okay! We go straight to\NHaido City Hotel, Room 2407!
0.5;Look at this manuscript!\NThere's more dialogue!
0.5;Haido City Hotel.\NFollow those police cars.
0.5;It's been barely an hour\Nsince that manuscript was sent,
0.5;But I don't understand\Nwhat the captor wants.
0.5;Is a crazed fan anxious for the new\NDet. Samonji series behind this?
0.5;Was it an abduction to\Nget a popular writer's money?
0.5;No, Room 2407 is a suite.\NThat doesn't fit.
0.5;What is the plan of the person\Nwho's forcing Shinmei-sensei to write
0.5;Wait a minute!\NIf he can't sign his name...
0.5;...that means he's dictating\Nhis story to someone!
0.5;Then he's having\Nsomeone else type it all out,
0.5;even when one misplaced\Nletter could ruin the code?!
0.5;Adding and removing for no\Nreason would make anyone suspicious!
0.5;Even if his wife was typing,\Nthe person watching would notice!
0.5;Wait! Hold on! Could\Nthis incident actually be--?!
0.5;The captor may have\Na weapon! Everyone stay sharp!
0.5;Your father passed\Naway just moments ago.
0.5;I called your home many times,\Nbut I couldn't get a hold of you.
0.5;There is no kidnapper.\NIf there was, it'd be Shinmei himself.
0.5;I, of course, feel happiness\Nwhen I receive praise for my works,
0.5;but in my forty years of writing,\Nthere's a happiness I've yet to have.
0.5;Just once, I'd like to\Nsee with my own eyes
0.5;the face of a reader who solves\Na mystery before I give the solution.
0.5;He said he wanted\Nto do so before he died,
0.5;so his physician and\NI helped him write his story here.
0.5;He lost use of his arms two\Nweeks ago, due to terminal cancer.
0.5;Your father told me not to tell you,\Nto give believability to his code.
0.5;Forgive your father, and consider\Nit his last selfish act, Kaori...
0.5;that he wanted to see the proud\Nlook of one of his readers.
0.5;He was probably waiting for a\Nreader who figured everything out
0.5;And now that he's gone,\Nthe novel will stay unfinished.
0.5;Kaori-san spectacularly\Ncompleted her father's novel
0.5;"and ""Halves at the Top""\Nmanaged to become a bestseller!"
0.5;Although this was because\Nshe was as skilled as her father,
0.5;the dimwitted detective, tomboy girl,\Nand the cheeky boy in glasses
0.5;who assisted Samonji in the\Nlast half of the story also helped.
0.5;"...but I could do\Nwithout the ""cheeky"" part."
0.5;I get a bad feeling that\Nthe killer is playing with us...
0.5;"Inside ""Mokujin,"" a trick box \Nmade by Samizu Kichiemon,"
0.5;"is the big jewel and Kaito \NKid's target ""Luna Memoria."""
0.5;can be found in one of ten thousand \Nbooks donated to the Suzuki Library.
0.5;Is it possible your husband \Nhid the page somewhere else?
0.5;My husband died last month in \Nan unfortunate traffic accident.
0.5;He couldn't have foreseen that \Nand hidden the page elsewhere.
0.5;Then maybe it's in a book \Nyou wouldn't normally read.
0.5;and trick box will probably prevent \Nhim from taking the moonstone.
0.5;Not even that pretentious \Nthief could manage that.
0.5;I'll see through the disguise of the thief \Ncoming after the trick box full of memories!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Akai-san seems more interested in \Nhis surroundings than his book.
0.5;The only ones who aren't suspicious \Nare Jirokichi and the old woman.
0.5;he'd have plenty of opportunities \Nto swap out the box.
0.5;And Kid wouldn't get so upset \Nover the box getting wet.
0.5;Kid's disguised himself \Nas them before, hasn't he?
0.5;There's a book up there \Nthat I'm interested in,
0.5;Since they're both about \Nas tall as the professor...
0.5;You may look like a child, but you're \Na dirty old man on the inside.
0.5;I was just observing her to \Nsee if it was Kid in disguise.
0.5;He's the only one who's been \Nin this room the whole time.
0.5;It's possible he's been disguised as Okiya \NSubaru all along and snuck in that way.
0.5;my husband and I kept an exchange \Ndiary when we were students.
0.5;or how I felt about my \Nhusband on a single page.
0.5;But my husband only ever \Nwrote a few sentences.
0.5;I found the exchange diary \Non my husband's desk.
0.5;As I was reading the awkward \Nwriting of my younger self
0.5;with feelings of embarrassment \Nand nostalgia,
0.5;My husband took it from \Nme immediately after that.
0.5;Perhaps it's related to the \Npiece of paper we can't find.
0.5;Your husband may have been eating \Nrice balls while reading that page.
0.5;you should be able to find \Nthe true contents of the box.
0.5;Looks like you've figured \Nit out, too, Detective.
0.5;Both where that paper is and \Nthe true contents of the box.
0.5;You figured out where the written \Ninstructions to open the box are?
0.5;On the front and back of the \Ntorn page, we'll draw a circle.
0.5;There. Now study it carefully \Nand remember what it looks like.
0.5;Once you've memorized it, can you \Nput it back inside the notebook?
0.5;By flipping through it, \Nit should instantly...
0.5;See how the bottom edge of the page \Nis slightly torn where the paper is?
0.5;That makes it so it doesn't \Nget caught on your finger
0.5;when you flip through it \Nso you skip over that page.
0.5;If you flip through the pages \Nwhile holding them from the top,
0.5;I tore the edge of the page while \Nyou were all looking at the paper.
0.5;the same trick in the exchange \Ndiary she mentioned.
0.5;The old woman was able to find \Nthem because she was carefully
0.5;unless we know which of these ten \Nthousand books uses the same trick...
0.5;Even if you make the \Ninstructions hard to find,
0.5;you'd eventually find them if you turned \Neach page like the old woman did.
0.5;But your husband said you'd \Nnever find them, right?
0.5;But Subaru-san and Ai-chan \Nexamined the mystery novels
0.5;and monster stories the old \Nwoman didn't like, right?
0.5;She doesn't have to read \Nthem to look for the paper.
0.5;It's a book with pages \Nshe'd never need to turn.
0.5;because she'd learned \Nsomething even better
0.5;meat and potatoes \Nrecipe in a cookbook, isn't it?
0.5;I see. She learned the recipe \Nfrom her mother-in-law.
0.5;And if it were between the \Npages of any other recipe,
0.5;even if he used the trick \Nyou described earlier,
0.5;If we all search for it, it \Nshould take only a few minutes.
0.5;We agreed not to enter this time \Nuntil we've received the signal.
0.5;he won't be able to open the \Ntrick box in the darkness.
0.5;Didn't she say the box plays \Nmusic when it's opened?
0.5;Are you saying he opened \NSamizu Kichiemon's trick box
0.5;in the darkness in such \Na short amount of time?
0.5;The security shutters linked \Nto the cage are closed.
0.5;I'll find him, even if it means pulling \Nthe faces of everyone in here.
0.5;I'd allow you to display the \Ntrick box here on the condition
0.5;While searching the books \Naccording to what that boy said,
0.5;"Anyway, the professor doesn't call me \N""Conan-kun"" when we're alone together."
0.5;The professor had one on the second \Njoint of his pointer finger,
0.5;couldn't reach while standing on \Nher tip toes on top of a chair?
0.5;Probably because you were using the \Nthickness of the professor's legs
0.5;to bend your knees and \Nmake yourself look shorter,
0.5;A mid-19th Century tinkerer \Nwouldn't have known the song.
0.5;Are you sure you don't need \Nto check out that moonstone?
0.5;I thought you were looking \Nfor a special jewel.
0.5;after a thief stole it \Nfrom that woman's husband.
0.5;I'd like you to return those \Nphotos you took of me.
0.5;Come to think of it, he had some \Nkind of device on his neck.
0.5;as the search for Kaito Kid \Nenters its twelfth hour.
0.5;They're hoping to arrest Kaito \NKid as soon as possible.
0.5;This is Wakasa-sensei. She'll be my \Nassistant homeroom teacher starting today.

0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The New \NTeacher's Skeleton Case, Part One!"""
0.5;Ten years ago while visiting the beach \Nwith my family, I met another family.
0.5;it would be strange for only the \Npassenger window to be open.
0.5;So, they abandoned their \Nfriend and fled alone.
0.5;This man wasn't wearing his seat \Nbelt at the time of the accident.
0.5;I'm saying he struck his \Nhead on the windshield
0.5;It broke his cervical vertebrae, \Nkilling him instantly.
0.5;It's probably safe to assume the \Npassenger determined he was dead
0.5;when they received no response \Nafter calling out to him,
0.5;But why would they pretend \Nto be one of the crowd here?
0.5;If they were a victim of an accident, \Nthey wouldn't need to hide.
0.5;He beautifully dances his \Nmystery-solving steps!
0.5;The family on the beach and the car's \Nfall are both deeply shrouded in mystery!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;We did receive a report about \Nan hour ago that two thieves
0.5;entered a watchmaker's shop about \Na kilometer from here.
0.5;How do you know about an incident that \Nhasn't been reported by the news yet?
0.5;There was a bag in the back \Nseat of the sunken car.
0.5;Only a thief concerned \Nwith stealing the watches
0.5;and escaping would so casually \Nstuff them into a bag.
0.5;I brought all the customers who went \Nshopping after the car fell into the ocean.
0.5;This chubby man bought a \NT-shirt and swim trunks.
0.5;that fell into the water \Nhad someone with him.
0.5;When she suddenly brought up marriage \Nwhile we were on a rubber boat,
0.5;So she pushed me into the ocean, \Nand my clothes were soaked.
0.5;By the time I returned to \Nthe boat, she was gone.
0.5;She was pretty angry, so she probably \Ntook the car home without me.
0.5;On top of that, the straps \Non my sandals broke,
0.5;so I bought some new ones \Nand was on my way home.
0.5;I had no choice but to buy a three \Nthousand yen shirt from that beach hut.
0.5;Do you use those watches you have \Non both wrists to hit on women?
0.5;This one's on Japan time, and \Nthis one's on New York time.
0.5;I told you not to call since \NI'd be writing until dinner.
0.5;A car fell at the beach, \Nand the driver's dead?
0.5;and they've blended in with \Nthe crowd on the beach.
0.5;She may be curious, but I can't \Nfigure it out based on photos alone.
0.5;I already told you that when \Nthe car fell into the ocean,
0.5;A nearby watchmaker was \Nattacked by a pair of thieves,
0.5;at the beach hut after the \Ncar fell are our suspects.
0.5;bought new sandals since \Nthe strap on hers broke.
0.5;The flashy guy who came to hit \Non women had his clothes stolen,
0.5;so he bought a three thousand \Nyen Hawaiian shirt.
0.5;The culprit is most likely the \Nwoman who bought the sandals...
0.5;You were riding in the car \Nthat fell, weren't you?
0.5;A young man on the beach \Njust said the same thing.
0.5;If what you're wearing is \Nactually a swimsuit, that is.
0.5;When she escaped from the sinking car, \Nshe was wearing pants or a skirt.
0.5;She found herself on a public \Nbeach when she surfaced.
0.5;If she exited the water \Nin what she was wearing,
0.5;she was wearing. and wrapped her \Nscarf around her waist like a wraparound.
0.5;Then she tied up the hem of her shirt \Nso she could pretend to be a swimmer.
0.5;Actually, it's more accurate to \Nsay she could only buy sandals.
0.5;her wallet was submerged, \Nand her bills got wet.
0.5;So I thought the woman who \Ntook off her wet shoes
0.5;As you can see, unless you're \Nright on the water's edge,
0.5;but the beach hut employees would've \Nremembered someone like that.
0.5;And I doubt the beach hut \Naccepts credit cards.
0.5;On top of that, the robbery \Noccurred just before the car fell.
0.5;is explaining exactly the \Nsame reasoning I told you.
0.5;I can't see too well since \Nhe's wearing sunglasses,
0.5;Come to think of it, they \Nwere all wearing them.
0.5;You're wearing a watch \Nyou stole from the store.
0.5;Your watch is exactly \Nlike it was in the store.
0.5;Oh, it probably broke \Nwhen I went in the water.
0.5;Watches sold in stores are \Ngenerally stopped around 10:10,
0.5;I asked my dad about it at the \Nwatch area in a department store.
0.5;Once we sell the watches, should \Nwe head to a tropical island?
0.5;We broke through the guardrail \Nand fell into the sea.
0.5;This must be what it \Nmeans to hit rock bottom.
0.5;You said something about \Njoining the FBI earlier.
0.5;Don't tell me finding the thief \Nwho blended in with the crowd
0.5;If things go well, I might even find \Nthe people who killed my father.
0.5;and be a father figure \Nto Shukichi and Masumi,
0.5;But in exchange, if you leave any \Nhaze behind, I won't forgive you.
0.5;He wants to ask you about the \Ncase again at the station.
0.5;You're the one who identified \Nthe truth about the watch.
0.5;After all, you're the apprentice \Nof my country's greatest detective.
0.5;And then there's the brother \Nbetween Sera and Akai-san.
0.5;the face of the woman \NHaneda Meijin called Mary.
0.5;as the Sister From Another \NDomain Sera mentioned.

0.5;A news photographer\Nwho chases incidents,
0.5;Those were amazing photos!\NHow did you take them?
0.5;I just happened to pass\Nby that fire at the time.
0.5;Yanase-san will be helping\Nme quite a bit from now on.
0.5;Yeah, this is Nakai.\NGet the detective.
0.5;I got something important\Nto tell him! My life is in danger!
0.5;What is this about\Nyour life being in danger?
0.5;If anything happens to me,\Ninvestigate it.
0.5;Nakai-san! What happened?!\NNakai-san!
0.5;I already told you,\NI can't drink any more...
0.5;Hurry here, Driver!\NMy daddy ran out on me!
0.5;It was just sheer luck.\NI have God to thank, yet again.
0.5;For a news photographer,\Nhe is incredibly lucky.
0.5;...but the examiners believe he\Nslipped and hit his head while drunk.
0.5;As a result, the police have\Ndeemed this an accident, not a crime.
0.5;I don't know the details, but apparently\Nit started in the kitchen sink.
0.5;Sink? Maybe a thrown-out\Ncigarette lit something on fire?
0.5;Anyways, that was where\Nthe fire burned the most.
0.5;Doing questioning first thing\Nin the morning has me starved!
0.5;The call meant for the old guy\Nlast night was at 10:30 p.m.
0.5;Judging from how the fire was,\Nit must've started right after the call.
0.5;Yanase, the photographer,\Nwas taking pictures from there...
0.5;It's the same height as\NNakai-san's apartment!
0.5;It's too perfect for someone\Nwho just happened to pass by!
0.5;Plus, it's only three minutes\Nbetween here and there!
0.5;They really are\Nfrom the decisive moment!
0.5;This one in particular!\NSee the mirror far in the back?
0.5;Think you can zoom in\Non it and make it clearer?
0.5;The fire's heat had\Nabout this much effect...
0.5;Did you figure\Nsomething out, Shinichi?
0.5;But this is still\Ncircumstantial evidence.
0.5;This Yanase guy is going to be\Non TV tomorrow. I saw an ad for it.
0.5;People in the spotlight\Nthese days all get their own shows.
0.5;I must've gone over the speed\Nlimit when I saw smoke from the fire.
0.5;A photographer out\Nto get a decisive moment

0.5;Hello? Metro Police?\NThis is Mori Kogoro.
0.5;There's something on\Nyour collar. I'll get it for you!
0.5;The button speaker\Nis attached! All set to go!
0.5;Hello, everyone.\NI'm Yanase Ryuichi.
0.5;Our guest for the first\Nepisode of Yanase World
0.5;is the great detective,\NMori Kogoro-san!
0.5;You're also known as Sleeping Kogoro,\Nwhich I'd like to ask about.
0.5;but I think I'd rather\Nfocus on the incident.
0.5;You know, the one\Nwhere you committed arson
0.5;and murdered Nakai-san,\Nthe investigative reporter?
0.5;This certainly comes\Nas a surprise, but sure.
0.5;But your accusation\Nwas completely off, Mori-san.
0.5;There's a happening\Nin the very first episode!
0.5;Yeah! This is great!\NThe battle of the century!
0.5;First of all, I was taking\Nphotos of the highway at the time.
0.5;How could I have possibly lit\Na fire inside Nakai-san's apartment?
0.5;Using the exit point for\Npassengers getting off the highway bus,
0.5;you could travel between the\Nphoto spot and the scene in three minutes.
0.5;You used that to enter his apartment\Nand attack and knock him out.
0.5;You then set up an ignition\Ntimer and returned to the highway,
0.5;where you waited for the fire\Nto start so you could photograph it.
0.5;Oh? But no timing devices\Nwere found in the remnants of the fire.
0.5;when quicklime and water are combined,\Na chemical reaction occurs
0.5;There are cases in which bags\Nof quicklime left at construction sites
0.5;have ignited and caused fires\Nafter rainwater leaked inside.
0.5;With some paper and\Nflammable objects all around it,
0.5;This is probably how you took\Nyour award-winning photos as well.
0.5;But your victim found\Nout and blackmailed you!
0.5;It may be true that such a trick\Nis possible, but you have no proof.
0.5;Now, then! Let me\Nshow you the definitive proof!
0.5;First, the kitchen faucet.\NHave a look at the handle.
0.5;I don't know.\NIt might've just been left on.
0.5;What happened to the watch\Nyou received for winning the contest?
0.5;Apparently, there's only one\Nwristwatch like it in the world.
0.5;to keep it from getting wet,\Nbut then accidentally left it there?
0.5;As it was quite close to the source\Nof the fire, it was rather burned.
0.5;I just realized now that it\Nwas the late Nakai who stole it!
0.5;So you intend on\Nplaying innocent to the end?
0.5;It's from 10:20 p.m.,\Non the night of the incident.
0.5;In other words, it's from ten\Nminutes before the victim called me.
0.5;Doc, can you display\Nit on the computer monitor?
0.5;You claim your wristwatch\Nwas stolen right after the ceremony.
0.5;So why do you have it on\Nright before photographing the fire?
0.5;The fact that wristwatch\Nwas in Nakai-san's apartment
0.5;A photographer out to\Ncapture a definitive moment
0.5;was caught at a\Ndefinitive moment himself.
0.5;It seems you forgot the most\Nimportant fact for a photographer.
0.5;"""Photograph"" is written as\N""displaying the truth"" in Japanese!"
0.5;The staff said the ratings\Nwere through the roof!
0.5;Your sister was killed\Nand buried in the yard?!
0.5;But it's illegal to enter\Nothers' yards without permission.
0.5;But is there really a\Nbody buried in this yard?!
0.5;High school student Shinichi was\Nforced to take a drug that shrunk him!
0.5;Although smaller, my mind\Nremains that of a sharp detective!
0.5;Today's case is the continuation\Nof a reunion murder case!
0.5;"Let's listen to ""Mune ga Doki Doki""\Nas we review the last episode!"

0.5;the high school gym instructor,\NAyashiro Yukio,
0.5;the Chiba Prefectural police\Ndetective, Nakamichi Kazushi,
0.5;and then me,\NRan, and the old man.
0.5;who was still in her room\Nafter the fireworks show ended,
0.5;only to find that she\Nhad committed suicide
0.5;A makeshift autopsy showed\Nthat she had died seven hours earlier--
0.5;at around 3:00 p.m., when\Neveryone was playing ping-pong
0.5;before leaving\Nfor the fireworks show!
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nshe did say something...
0.5;Say, how did Yumi-san\Nshoot herself in the head?
0.5;She put the gun up\Nto her head like so and--
0.5;Normally when someone\Ncommits suicide with a gun,
0.5;they stick the barrel\Nagainst their head, right?
0.5;Then her bullet wound\Nis missing something vital.
0.5;a stream of hot air\Naccompanies the bullet!
0.5;If you shoot with\Nthe gun against your head,
0.5;it would have to\Nleave burn marks behind!
0.5;The fact that there\Nare none here means...
0.5;Someone shot her and then\Ntried to make it look like a suicide!
0.5;You don't think\None of us did it, do you?!
0.5;Now, now.\NDon't get ahead of yourself.
0.5;I just said the murder\Ntook place at approximately 3:00.
0.5;That was right after\Nshe went off on her own.
0.5;We were all in the ping-pong\Nroom from 3:00 to 6:00,
0.5;was when Omura\Nwent to the restroom.
0.5;and he came back\Nin less than a minute.
0.5;the killer could have gone\Nanywhere along the roof,
0.5;It's very conceivable that\Nsomeone entered from outside.
0.5;At any rate, let's hear\Nwhat the employees have to say.
0.5;Someone might've\Nseen a suspicious character.
0.5;We were all out\Nto lunch at three o'clock,
0.5;and even after we came back,\Nthere was no one that suspicious--
0.5;I believe that was around 6:30,\Njust when the fireworks started...
0.5;so she wouldn't\Nmiss the fireworks!
0.5;We went to her room\Nand were about to go in, but...
0.5;She gets grumpy\Nwhen people wake her up,
0.5;so I figured it\Nbest that they didn't.
0.5;Yeah. I had worked up\Na sweat playing ping-pong
0.5;so I took a quick\Ndip in the public bath.
0.5;I felt bad for making you and Omura\Ngo on ahead and save our spot,
0.5;but you two were\Ntaking a bath too, correct?
0.5;Yeah. We were in\Nthe open-air bath, though...
0.5;If only we had gone to\Nwake her up, she might still be--
0.5;Yumi died while\Nwe were playin' ping-pong!
0.5;We would've been\Ntoo late no matter what...
0.5;You've been acting\Nstrange since this evening!
0.5;That can't be!\NYumi was already dead!
0.5;Don't be stupid!\NThat's impossible!
0.5;Get serious!\NThere's no such thing as ghosts!
0.5;Your mind was just confused\Nbecause you were tired!
0.5;What's all this about\Nghosts and dying?
0.5;Then they need medical\Ntreatment right away!
0.5;The police are on\Ntheir way as we speak.
0.5;Why did that person\Nsay that at that time?!
0.5;Don't tell me the\Nmurderer is one of you?!
0.5;The murderer was\Nsomeone else! Don't worry!
0.5;Say, isn't it too early to tell\Nthat this was an outside job?
0.5;After all, the way\NYumi-san was killed was--
0.5;Quiet! I don't need\Nany of your babbling!
0.5;Would someone\Nwho snuck in from outside
0.5;kill somebody and\Nmake it look like a suicide?!
0.5;In other words,\Nit was one of my best friends!
0.5;I don't know\Nwhy or how they did it,
0.5;but I won't let them\Nget away with this!
0.5;I'll expose them for\Nwhat they are! This I swear!
0.5;It's most likely the person\Nwho said that one odd thing.
0.5;But that person\Nhas a perfect alibi--
0.5;they were in the ping-pong\Nroom with everyone else!
0.5;I checked Yumi-san's estimated\Ntime of death for myself,
0.5;In which case,\Nhow did that person kill her?
0.5;is the fact that Yumi-san's\Nfinger wasn't on the trigger
0.5;You would expect the\Nkiller to put her finger on it
0.5;It also bothers me that she\Ndidn't have any undergarments on
0.5;and that she had\Nchanged into a large yukata...
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nthat's the name of this inn, too...
0.5;The fact all these\Narrows are stuck in him
0.5;must mean this is from\Nwhen Benkei died standing up.
0.5;I've finally figured\Nout the trick the killer used!
0.5;I'll just put the old\Nman to sleep like always
0.5;In other words,\Nit was one of my best friends!
0.5;I won't let them\Nget away with this!
0.5;I'll expose them for what they are!\NThis I swear!
0.5;Perhaps the killer\Ncame to steal her things
0.5;but shot her\Nwhen she spotted him.
0.5;Why didn't we hear the shot\Nwhen we were playing ping-pong?
0.5;The killer has to be in here,\Nso why do they all have alibis?!
0.5;Judging from the\Nstate of her rigor mortis,
0.5;Yumi's estimated time\Nof death was around 3:00 p.m.
0.5;Which means she was murdered\Nimmediately after she left us
0.5;The rest of us were in the\Nping-pong room from 3:00 to 6:00.
0.5;She was glaring at the ping-pong\Nroom from an upstairs window!
0.5;Omura went to\Nthe bathroom just after 5:00.
0.5;Conan-kun! What are\Nyou saying at a time like this?!
0.5;My shakehand grip\Nis pretty good, you know!
0.5;That reminds me, Yumi-san\Nused the shakehand grip too, huh?
0.5;Remember? She was holding a racket\Nwith a shakehand-style in that picture.
0.5;Yeah, but you can't\Nplay right now! Okay?
0.5;I'd have to change\Nclothes if I got all sweaty.
0.5;Come to think of it,\NYumi had changed into a large yukata...
0.5;you hold the racket\Nwith your index finger out.
0.5;Could Yumi have been\Nplaying ping-pong with the murderer
0.5;I could swear they mentioned\Nsomething at the police academy--
0.5;Say, didn't Benkei\Ndie while standing up?
0.5;and then died on his feet when\Nthey showered him with arrows!
0.5;Hey, Mori.\NWhat's the shouting about?
0.5;I've finally figured\Nout who killed Yumi!
0.5;I was in the ping-pong\Nroom with everyone else
0.5;Assuming she really\Nwas killed at 3:00 p.m.!
0.5;What are you talking about?\NWe checked her time of death together!
0.5;Yumi's toes were\Nindeed beginning to stiffen,
0.5;so I estimated that she\Nhad died over seven hours prior.
0.5;sudden deaths during\Nintense physical exertion.
0.5;So Benkei's death\Nwhile standing up--
0.5;that it's possible to\Ndie while standing up.
0.5;What kind of exercise\Nare you saying I made her do?
0.5;No, she wasn't forced\Nto exert herself in her room--
0.5;You made her play ping-pong\Nright up until you killed her!
0.5;You were most likely\Nsupposed to meet her all alone
0.5;But then you invited us\Nall into the room!
0.5;Oh yeah! What do you say\Nwe play some ping-pong now?
0.5;Naturally, Yumi grew angry\Nand returned to her room.
0.5;After 6:00,\Nwhen everyone had left,
0.5;Yumi went by herself to the\Nping-pong room, where you were waiting.
0.5;It must've been quite\Nthe secret rendezvous.
0.5;You then invited her\Nto a game of ping-pong.
0.5;you got her\Nto return to her room...
0.5;...at which point\Nyou shot her in the head.
0.5;All to skew the estimated time\Nof death and create the perfect alibi!
0.5;Yumi rushed back to her\Nroom still holding the racket.
0.5;That's why her right\Nhand which held the gun
0.5;had stiffened\Nin the shakehand grip!
0.5;So the Yumi\NI saw right after 5:00 was--
0.5;She was watching\Nthe ping-pong room
0.5;from the 2nd floor and waiting\Nfor Nakamichi to be all alone!
0.5;The gunshot would seem inconspicuous\Nwith all the fireworks exploding about!
0.5;of wiping off the body's sweat\Nand changing the clothes--
0.5;there was a chance\Nthe trick could be discovered
0.5;if we learned that\Nshe had been sweating.
0.5;He had no choice but\Nto remove her undergarments,
0.5;But in the middle of his work,\Nan unforeseen obstacle appeared:
0.5;Ran and Conan,\Nwho came to wake Yumi up.
0.5;You stopped your\Nwork halfway through,
0.5;exited onto the\Nroof through the window,
0.5;and stopped Ran\Nfrom entering the room.
0.5;You then went with\Neveryone to see the fireworks,
0.5;That's when you put the gun in\Nher hand to make it look like a suicide.
0.5;had already stiffened\Ninto that peculiar grip,
0.5;But do you have\Nany proof that I did it?
0.5;The only person besides\Nme who could've pulled that off
0.5;And besides, anybody\Ncould learn that from a book.
0.5;This great policeman\Ncouldn't possibly be the killer.
0.5;He knew that Yumi-san was dead\Njust by seeing her covered in blood!
0.5;You said the following\Nwithout ever touching Yumi...
0.5;Nobody but me and Mori are to\Ncome in here, since we're detectives!
0.5;For some reason you\Ncalled not for an ambulance,
0.5;You did this because\Nshe would hinder your marriage?!
0.5;That's when her\Nthreatening letters and phone calls
0.5;Finally she said she was going\Nto send photos of just the two of us!
0.5;I told her that if she brought\Nthe photos to the reunion
0.5;That was the day\Nyou caught the bank robber.
0.5;I was struggling over\Nwhat to do about her...
0.5;The deal was to take\Nplace in the ping-pong room,
0.5;"""The photos have been\Nremoved from your things."""
0.5;So that's why Yumi\Nrushed back to her room,
0.5;I shot the demon\Nwho screwed up my life!
0.5;Seems you're still\Nas strong as ever...
0.5;Don't be stupid.\NYou've just gotten weaker.
0.5;"You can't blame him;\Nthose were his friends..."
0.5;That reminds me,\Nif he's that strong,
0.5;why didn't he ever\Nwin any matches?
0.5;Apparently, in actual\Nmatches he gets so tense
0.5;So he had a\Nknack for being outdone...
0.5;Oh, Inspector Megure!\NGood morning!
0.5;For someone who died while\Nsweating, there's too much here!
0.5;If his heart attack\Nwas intentionally caused,
0.5;then Tokito-san\Nis the prime suspect!
0.5;But how exactly\Ncould he have done it?!

0.5;As usual, Ran won the \Ngrand prize in a lottery,
0.5;Nope. We'll have lunch after \Nwe've done some more sightseeing.
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;"""The Young Kaga Lady's \NMystery Tour, Part One!"""
0.5;Because it's embarrassing to wear \Nthe same outfit over and over.
0.5;How rude of you to ask a lady \Nabout the contents of her bag.
0.5;We're here sightseeing and don't \Nknow exactly how to get there.
0.5;If you tell them where you're going, \Nthey'll probably take you there.
0.5;Where can I get a taxi? I've \Nnever ridden one before.
0.5;If we had that 10 thousand yen, we \Ncould've eaten a luxurious lunch today.
0.5;She's even more of a \Npampered lady than Sonoko.
0.5;He said he'd get something \Nlight to eat on his own.
0.5;By the way, why are you \Ncarrying so much cash?
0.5;I'm sure it's not uncommon for her \Nto carry around a few million yen.
0.5;Good. Now Manabu-san \Nwill be returned safely.
0.5;They'll release the hostage because \NI gave them the money, right?
0.5;It's possible the culprit has \Nno further use for the hostage,
0.5;It was sent to the office \Naround 10 this morning.
0.5;And you received the \Nkidnapping call then, too?
0.5;Two hours have passed since the \Nransom money was handed off.
0.5;It's hard to be optimistic \Ngiven the circumstances.
0.5;I'm having the police review the security \Ncamera footage from the parking lot.
0.5;Even if we find evidence that leads \Nus to the culprit, by that time...
0.5;I see. Is the hostage a \Nprinted silk maker as well?
0.5;Yes. He used to be a famous \Nartisan around here.
0.5;Recently he had an accident \Nin the storage shed.
0.5;Unfortunately, for now we can \Nonly pray for his safety.
0.5;Manabu ran to a nearby police box \Nand was taken into their custody.
0.5;He'll return here after being \Nquestioned by the police.
0.5;Sir, I'm sorry for the \Ninconvenience I caused.
0.5;How could you inconvenience us? \NYou're a plague on this company.
0.5;The president can't talk back to \NMari-chan because he adores her.
0.5;Although it's a different story \Nwhen it comes to boyfriends.
0.5;Excuse the interruption, but Manabu-san, \NI'm glad you're all right.
0.5;No. They used some kind \Nof device to modify it.
0.5;So we have no clues to \Nthe culprit's identity.
0.5;Manabu-san, where and \Nwhen were you kidnapped?
0.5;Maybe that means the culprit was \Nfamiliar with your regular routine.
0.5;If that's true, then it's possible \Nthe kidnapper is an acquaintance.
0.5;because Manabu-san would've been \Nvery familiar with their voice.
0.5;By the way, where were you \Naround nine this morning?
0.5;Her door was open while I was cleaning \Nthis morning, and I caught a glimpse of her.
0.5;Which means you're able to \Nverify each other's stories.
0.5;In other words, you have no \None to verify your alibi.
0.5;Maybe so, but we were right here when \Nthe ransom money was handed off.
0.5;Which means the culprit is \Nsomeone not currently present.
0.5;You're the one who kidnapped Manabu \Nand took my 30 million yen!
0.5;You're accusing me of \Nkidnapping? Give me a break.
0.5;You only approached Mari for my money, \Nand you're still playing dumb?
0.5;Kondo-san, where were you \Nthis morning at nine?
0.5;I'm so glad Manabu-san didn't \Nhave a single scratch on him.
0.5;Since he was tied up, I was \Nworried he'd been assaulted.
0.5;I noticed you were lying \Nabout the kidnapping.
0.5;Why aren't there any rope \Nburns on your hands?
0.5;They just disappeared because \Nsome time has passed.
0.5;No. You were never tied \Nup in the first place.
0.5;If you look closely at this photo, you \Ncan see your back reflected in it.
0.5;You're just holding your hands \Nbehind you. You're not tied up.
0.5;It's too bad, but you can't \Ndeceive the eyes of Mori Kogoro.

0.5;The security cameras caught the culprit \Ncarrying off the ransom money.
0.5;Their face is disguised, \Nbut their ears are visible.
0.5;If their shape matches yours, then \Nwe'll know if you're the kidnapper.
0.5;Thank you for treating us \Nto such a luxurious meal.
0.5;By the way, Manabu-san mentioned something \Nabout his retirement pay when he ran.
0.5;He was probably talking about how my dad \Nreduced Manabu-san's retirement pay.
0.5;I'm the one who suffered \Nlosses from his injury!
0.5;Let's go home, get some sleep, and \Ngo sightseeing again tomorrow.
0.5;But before returning to the hotel, let's \Nget some ramen to round off the night!

0.5;Aside from Mori-san's, they didn't find \Na single fingerprint on the phone.

0.5;Mori-kun, you were supposed to \Nmeet the victim at six, right?

0.5;Time to get up!\NMasked Yaiba is about to start!
0.5;It's pain medicine-- your mouth might\Nhurt once the anesthetic wears off.
0.5;Masked Yaiba!\NThanks for protecting me!
0.5;Thanks to you,\Nthat barely hurt at all!
0.5;I thanked him\Nand put the card back.
0.5;Don't look so down!\NI'm sure someone taped it!
0.5;Oh, Conan-kun!\NI've been waiting for you!
0.5;I'm here to double-check\Nsomething about last night.
0.5;Why did Sawaki Yoko\Ntake the apartment manager
0.5;she had complained about\NNakamoto's TV being on too loud
0.5;when she came home\Nfrom the clinic at around 8:30.
0.5;When he didn't hear anything,\Nhe opened the door
0.5;only to find the victim's\Nbody lying there.
0.5;then Dr. Yoko must\Nhave a big motive!
0.5;Twenty-six years ago,\NNakamoto Katsuhiko
0.5;But Nakamoto was\Nreleased on lack of evidence.
0.5;The boy had a seven year\Nold sister at the time,
0.5;So basically, she had\Nplenty of reason to kill him...
0.5;Right. But she says\Nshe had no idea that Nakamoto
0.5;was the prime suspect\Nin the old murder case.
0.5;Seems too good\Nto be a coincidence...
0.5;I bet you're actually here to hear\Nthe great detective's opinion, huh?
0.5;No, uh, it's my duty as an\Nofficer to work with citizens...
0.5;Is that so? In that case,\NI'd be glad to assist you!
0.5;The question is the alibi\Nthat Ayumi-kun testified to.
0.5;By car, it takes fifteen minutes\Nto go from the clinic
0.5;and then drove back to the clinic,\Nit would take approximately fifty minutes.
0.5;In other words, without Ayumi-kun's\Ntestimony that Sawaki Yoko
0.5;woke her up at 7:30 and\Nwatched Masked Yaiba with her,
0.5;Say, are you certain the murder\Ntook place around 7:30?
0.5;Yes. Nakamoto's employee was on\Nthe phone with him just before it happened.
0.5;The autopsy also confirms\Nthat he died at around 7:30.
0.5;In other words,\NSawaki's alibi is airtight.
0.5;That's it!\NI've figured it out, Inspector!
0.5;Let's go to the Sawaki Dental\NClinic right this minute.
0.5;Are these the cards\NAyumi-chan mentioned?
0.5;We don't need any coffee,\Njust listen to my theory.
0.5;Inspector. The Masked Yaiba\Nthat she woke Ayumi-kun up to see
0.5;and it wasn't 7:30\Nwhen she played it-- it was 8:00!
0.5;and played the Masked Yaiba\Ntape you had the VCR record.
0.5;Then you tricked her\Ninto taking a sleeping pill,
0.5;then woke her up ten minutes later\Nand showed her the next-episode preview.
0.5;Naturally, you also changed the clock,\Nthereby distorting Ayumi-kun's sense of time!
0.5;There doesn't seem\Nto be a VCR here.
0.5;I'm sorry to say this,\Nbut your theory is wrong.
0.5;The reason being\Nthat it was exactly 8:00
0.5;And we arrived at\Nher house just after 8:05.
0.5;I'm sure you'll find\Nthis to be true if you check.
0.5;The old guy's theory\Nmissed the mark...
0.5;You should get home\Nbefore it gets dark out.
0.5;...but she insisted\Non having me leave!
0.5;Was it because having me around\Nwould prevent her from faking her alibi?
0.5;If she purposely made herself the first person\Nto discover the body right after coming home
0.5;to give the police\Na precise time of death,
0.5;then everything was\Ndone to verify her alibi!
0.5;then her alibi must\Nhave some sort of trick to it!
0.5;Alibi tricks can only be pulled off\Nby using people, places, and time.
0.5;People-wise, I doubt\NAyumi-chan's testimony is wrong.
0.5;The death and the dentist\Nappointment are fixed in time.
0.5;An under-construction\Napartment building?
0.5;Did they stop construction\Nbefore it was done?
0.5;...you could use the emergency stairs\Nto enter the apartment building unseen!
0.5;the curtains in her\Nclinic have the same pattern...
0.5;"If I'm right, then ""it""\Nshould be in her apartment!"
0.5;Conan-kun. \NWould you like some juice?
0.5;Did you throw your\Nrefrigerator away?
0.5;I guess it'd be suspicious if\Nyou dumped your furniture so soon,
0.5;but shouldn't you have\Nat least changed the curtains?
0.5;You made this room look exactly\Nlike the one in your clinic
0.5;to fool Ayumi-chan's\Nsense of location.
0.5;I'd love to hear your theory,\NMr. Detective.
0.5;put her in the car,\Nand left for Haido at 7:05.
0.5;At around 7:20, you stopped\Nthe car at the construction site,
0.5;carried Ayumi-chan up the emergency\Nstairs and into the building,
0.5;Then, at 7:30,\Nyou went next door
0.5;You then turned\Nhis TV up really loud,
0.5;in the hopes of having\Nsomeone discover his body.
0.5;then your alibi would\Nbecome suspect.
0.5;You returned to your room,\Nwoke Ayumi-chan up,
0.5;and showed her Masked Yaiba,\Nwhich had just started.
0.5;Ten minutes after\Nshe took your sleeping pill,
0.5;you drove her back to the clinic,\Narriving at around 7:54.
0.5;Then you woke her up again and\Nshowed her the next episode preview.
0.5;but when you came home, Nakamoto-san's\Nbody still hadn't been discovered.
0.5;"You had no choice but to get the manager\Nand just happen to ""find"" him together,"
0.5;fully aware that\Nyou would be a suspect.
0.5;But you don't have\Nany proof to back it up.
0.5;that Ayumi-chan put one\Nof these cards in her pocket
0.5;for good luck before\Nhaving her tooth pulled:
0.5;She put the card back\Nafter her tooth was pulled.
0.5;If she had done so in this room\Nand not at the clinic,
0.5;One of these cards should\Nhave Ayumi-chan's fingerprints on it.
0.5;Conan-kun. Have you\Ntold anyone about this?
0.5;I lose, Conan-kun.\NIt's exactly as you said.
0.5;You remembered\NNakamoto-san, didn't you?
0.5;As if I could ever\Nforget that face!
0.5;Twenty-six years ago, I saw\NNakamoto drive off with my brother!
0.5;The police couldn't trust\Nthe testimony of a seven year old,
0.5;If only someone like you\Nhad been on the case back then,
0.5;they would've found some other\Nevidence to prosecute Nakamoto.
0.5;I don't get it.\NWhy'd she turn herself in?
0.5;The police didn't have\Nany evidence at all.
0.5;Not just that, they hadn't even\Nseen through her trick.
0.5;Maybe she wanted to\Nbe caught from the very start.
0.5;Maybe that's why she used\NAyumi-chan to vouch for her alibi?
0.5;She heard about\Nyou from Ayumi-chan.
0.5;You're saying she\Nwanted me to find proof?
0.5;That, or the Sawaki Yoko-san\Nfrom twenty-six years ago
0.5;The old man was hired by \Nthree suspicious people
0.5;to protect the racing horse White Spirits, \Nwho had received several death threats.
0.5;The old man escorted the \Nhorse trailer, but...
0.5;At some point White Spirits was \Nswapped out for an impostor.
0.5;Horse owner Tokuyoshi received a ransom \Nnote demanding 100 million yen.
0.5;Tokuyoshi followed the \Nkidnapper's instructions alone
0.5;The two cases are connected \Nin a surprising way!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""The Thoroughbred Kidnapping \NCase, Part Two!"""
0.5;This is the horse blanket \NWhite Spirits was wearing.
0.5;Inspector, according to a local who \Ntook their garbage out an hour ago,
0.5;And there seems to be blood on it, \Nso they wanted us to investigate.
0.5;The blood on the horse blanket \Nmatched White Spirits'.
0.5;He's an extraordinary and \Npopular racing horse.
0.5;We should prepare for a press \Nconference immediately.
0.5;More importantly, we're still not \Nsure White Spirits was killed, right?
0.5;Kogoro-no-ojisan asked me \Nto do something for him.
0.5;This is the trailer the \Nreal White Spirits was in.
0.5;Which means we might know where it went if \Nwe follow it on the other security camera.
0.5;Are we sure the real White \NSpirits was in this trailer?
0.5;Well, we can't see inside the \Ntrailer from here, but...
0.5;But there's something \Nbothering you, isn't there?
0.5;Come to think of it, it must \Nbe since three days ago.
0.5;I couldn't find White Spirits' \Nspare riding or grooming gear.
0.5;So it disappeared along \Nwith the horse trailer.
0.5;I was working with another horse \Nthat day, so I was out at the track.
0.5;White Spirits rubbed against \Na splinter that formed there.
0.5;But the vet said it \Nfortunately wasn't serious,
0.5;I need you to convey a message \Nto the inspector immediately.
0.5;I thought I said I was through \Nwith detectives and the police!
0.5;Takagi, it better be true that you discovered \Nthe culprits and the truth behind the case.
0.5;Mori-san, you told me to tell the inspector \Nthat you uncovered the culprit's identity
0.5;Either way, it doesn't matter. \NHurry up and explain the situation.
0.5;Allow me to explain the culprit's \Nidentity and the truth behind the case.
0.5;and the stolen ransom money—used \Nfundamentally the same trick.
0.5;In other words, solve one, \Nand you've solved the other.
0.5;First, how was White Spirits \Nswapped out for another horse?
0.5;in the other identical trailer \Nparked on the side road.
0.5;Since his wife and child were kidnapped, he \Nwas forced to follow the culprit's instructions.
0.5;There was a convenience store at the \Nroad leading to the crime scene.
0.5;At Mori-san's direction, I investigated \Nthe security camera footage.
0.5;I found footage of a horse \Ntrailer exiting that side road
0.5;and passing in front of \Nthe convenience store.
0.5;But more importantly, the footage \Nwas from three days ago.
0.5;Which means it's possible \Nthe trailer and tire marks
0.5;were a camouflage created \Nthree days earlier.
0.5;In other words, the other trailer \Nwasn't on the side road that day,
0.5;The culprit did this to make us believe \Nthe horses were swapped, and...
0.5;No, but White Spirits was actually \Nswapped out for the impostor, so...
0.5;Wait. Which means they were swapped \Nnot there, but someplace else.
0.5;"That's what makes this case similar to \N""The Adventure of Silver Blaze."""
0.5;I actually investigated another \Nstable at Mori-san's direction, too.
0.5;It's that horse that looks \Nexactly like White Spirits.
0.5;In other words, the horses \Nweren't swapped there.
0.5;The disguise placed on White \NSpirits' brother was removed.
0.5;According to forensics, one is White \NSpirits' hair used in the disguise.
0.5;They probably both fell out \Nwhen the disguise was removed.
0.5;setting me up to fail, and made \Nhorse owner Tokuyoshi-san shun my
0.5;You think you've used the great Mori \NKogoro, but you haven't at all!
0.5;I thought I'd let the old man handle \Nthis one since he loves horses, but...
0.5;It's true that the three of \Nyou committed this crime.
0.5;that you have no alibis for when \NWhite Spirits was being transported.
0.5;when White Spirits and a horse trailer \Ntemporarily disappeared from the stable.
0.5;White Spirits was probably already swapped \Nout for White Legion at this time.
0.5;Trailer driver Shiomi-san, \Nyou're also their accomplice.
0.5;If there wasn't a second \Ntrailer on that side road,
0.5;Or were your wife and child \Npretending to be kidnapped, too?
0.5;However, there's a ringleader—a \Nmastermind behind this plot.
0.5;When did you become the \Ngreat confused detective?
0.5;to pay a 100 million \Nransom for a mere horse.
0.5;especially when you haven't \Nactually paid a single yen.
0.5;if there was actually 100 \Nmillion yen inside that back.
0.5;The bag Tokuyoshi-san took was \Nfilled with worthless stuffing.
0.5;Just as it was a different horse \Ninside the trailer all along,
0.5;You stuffed the magazines in the rack in \Nyour living room inside the bag, didn't you?
0.5;If there are any ripped \Nmagazines inside the bag,
0.5;Someone requested a payout \Nof the life insurance policy
0.5;on White Spirits with a major \Nforeign insurance company.
0.5;The problem lies in the date \Nthe money was requested.
0.5;It was the day before White \NSpirits' horse blanket was found.
0.5;B-Because they threatened \Nto kill White Spirits.
0.5;Surely you didn't really think \Nyou'd be paid the insurance money
0.5;It's actually because your \Nemployees reported to you
0.5;It's within my rights to \Nrequest the insurance money.
0.5;While acting according to Tokuyoshi's \NWhite Spirits kidnapping and murder plot,
0.5;in the end, you hid White Spirits in \Na safe place rather than killing him.
0.5;And to increase the credibility \Nof your report to Tokuyoshi,
0.5;you left an anonymous tip with the police \Nso they'd discover the horse blanket
0.5;White Spirits bled on when he \Nscratched himself at the stables.
0.5;White Spirits and White \NLegion were born there.
0.5;The trailer I used to transport \NWhite Spirits is there, too.
0.5;You must've raised White Spirits \Nsince the day he was born.
0.5;Tokuyoshi, who was under financial strain \Ndue to some reckless foreign investments,
0.5;planned to fake the kidnapping of \Nand ultimately kill White Spirits
0.5;in order to fraudulently obtain \Na huge insurance payout.
0.5;He used the debts his employees owned \Nto force them to carry out the crime.
0.5;they disguised themselves and hired \Nthe old man to protect White Spirits.
0.5;With a great detective on the case, they \Nassumed Tokuyoshi would cancel his plans.
0.5;having a famous detective nearby \Nwould help him play the victim
0.5;They pretended to follow his plan \Nand hid White Spirits instead,
0.5;hoping to reveal the truth and \Nthat White Spirits was safe
0.5;once Tokuyoshi requested \Nthe insurance money.
0.5;Tokuyoshi was arrested and his \Nemployees were questioned,
0.5;Later, White Spirits returned \Nto racing under a new owner.
0.5;Then the detective Mori \NKogoro might know something.
0.5;While these three are suspicious, \Nthe culprit isn't one of them.

0.5;Yes. On that night, he stole 30 \Nmillion yen from a bank in Beika.
0.5;I'm sure you know already, but \Ntwo hours after the robbery,
0.5;the culprit Shishido Takashi \Ndied in an accident,
0.5;but the 30 million yen he \Nstole is still missing.
0.5;What are you doing, mister?\NDid a new pachinko parlor open?
0.5;You idiot! I've been summoned \Nto Dongaraji Temple.
0.5;Someone sent Dongaraji\NTemple a phone threat?
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Yes. Construction started just yesterday, \Nbut late last night, we got a call.
0.5;Just the threat of a curse isn't \Nenough to make the police act.
0.5;It'll be too late if we wait \Nuntil something happens,
0.5;and were hoping you could \Nfind whoever made the threat.
0.5;I'm kind of curious. I wonder what \Nkind of threat the temple got.
0.5;How could a single person \Nappear in two places at once?
0.5;Toratani-san who lives down the street, \Nwas lying in the sun at Chuo Park.
0.5;Toratani Eisaku-san was at \NNishiguchi Park at the time.
0.5;It was from far away,\Nbut we greeted each other.
0.5;So two men suddenly became flustered \Nwhen they saw construction had begun?
0.5;Yesterday evening, I saw two men when I \Npassed by the gate of Dongaraji Temple.
0.5;So they made a phone threat to \Nmake them stop construction.
0.5;It could have been them. \NDo you know who they were?
0.5;They're Toratani-san's \Nsons, from second street.
0.5;There seems to be some reason the \Nconstruction at Dongaraji Temple
0.5;There are two people who claim \Nto have seen him at the same time
0.5;I'm not sure what's going on, \Nbut we'll know once we meet him.
0.5;Our dad is full of energy, \Nso he's always going out.
0.5;I'm more interested in \Nyou two than your dad!
0.5;In any case, we've got nothing \Nto do with Dongaraji Temple!
0.5;the Toratani family and Dongaraji Temple \Nhave nothing to do with each other.
0.5;There's three of them living \Nthere, but nobody works.
0.5;but the brothers Kinta and Ginsuke have no \Nmotivation and never keep a job for long.
0.5;but the brothers didn't report \Nit to the public office.
0.5;And they hid the body somewhere \Nin Dongaraji Temple.
0.5;But since construction started, \Nthe body might be unearthed,
0.5;That's insane. You don't \Nhave a shred of evidence.
0.5;Wait. If he suddenly fell ill, \Nthey would've called an ambulance
0.5;The two of them killed \Nhim with their own hands!
0.5;Why are you layering delusions \Non top of delusions?
0.5;But if you assume they're hiding\NEisaku-san's death, it does explain that.
0.5;Apparently Eisaku-san would \Nalways go sit in the sun
0.5;at Chuo Park and Nishiguchi \NPark on sunny days.
0.5;It would be suspicious if \Nhe didn't keep up the habit,
0.5;One of the brothers appeared here, \Nwhile the other went to Nishiguchi Park.
0.5;they ended up appearing in two \Ndifferent places at the same time.
0.5;When you look at it that way, \Nit does explain their actions.
0.5;If you wanted to see Eisaku \Nand he's not around anymore,
0.5;they had to trick you \Ninto thinking he was out.
0.5;Our dad is full of energy, \Nso he's always going out.
0.5;so you could continue to \Nillegally live off his pension!
0.5;I'm always telling him not to irresponsibly \Nsuspect people, but you know how kids are.
0.5;Although he was asking about breakfast \Nwhen it's already afternoon.
0.5;Those brothers must be the \Nones who stopped construction.
0.5;They're looking for the 30 million \Nyen that vanished, right?
0.5;Did they get a tip that \Nsomeone saw the culprit here?
0.5;We don't get papers delivered. \NThat was a special day.
0.5;They were probably curious about \Nhow the investigation was going.
0.5;Apparently, the culprit Shishido \Nfled this way after the robbery.
0.5;so he wouldn't get caught \Nby the security checkpoints.
0.5;Shishido didn't trust others, so \Nit's unlikely he had accomplices.
0.5;you're working on to the 30 million, \Nbut you don't always get what you want.
0.5;instead of going through the trouble \Nof stopping the construction,
0.5;Their dad's pension wasn't \Nenough for them to have fun,
0.5;so they stole the money from him \Nand hid it at the nearby temple.
0.5;They've got guts to steal from \Na robber, but I'll catch them!
0.5;But those brothers didn't seem \Nbold enough to commit a robbery.
0.5;Isn't that the day Eisaku-san \Ndisappeared again?
0.5;At night he sometimes \Nwanders around the city.
0.5;His sons went looking \Nfor him that night, too.
0.5;So they did it while they were looking for \Ntheir father and hid it at Dongaraji Temple.
0.5;It's fine. I'm glad you \Nwere able to find him.
0.5;So those brothers had nothing \Nto do with it from the start.
0.5;Then he buried his treasure \Nsomewhere in Dongaraji Temple.
0.5;He wanted to go get it, but \Nsomething was stopping him,
0.5;so he made a phone threat \Nto stop construction.
0.5;he wouldn't be telling \Neveryone about the backpack.
0.5;People start saying things they \Nshouldn't have as they get older.
0.5;Think. I probably already have \Nall the necessary pieces.
0.5;But why did they have to \Npretend to be their father?
0.5;I, Mori Kogoro, shall identify the \Nculprit who left the phone threat
0.5;and find the missing 30 million \Nyen in one fell swoop!
0.5;Both of these crimes were \Ncarried out by Tora—
0.5;when Toratani Eisaku witnessed a \Ncertain sight while wandering around.
0.5;He saw a man burying a backpack \Nhere at Dongaraji Temple.
0.5;No one knew what he meant until the next day \Nwhen his sons realized what he was saying.
0.5;The backpack the robber \Nstuffed the money in...
0.5;Dad, this guy was burying \Nthis last night, right?
0.5;We just have to wait for \Nhis memory to return.
0.5;Eisaku might tell anyone that he \Nsaw the backpack being buried.
0.5;And if he did, it might reach \Nthe ears of the police.
0.5;Fearing this, you kept him inside \Nso he wouldn't see anyone.
0.5;So no one would find \Nout you imprisoned him,
0.5;you pretended to be Eisaku \Nand went to the park,
0.5;though it's amusing that you ended \Nup in two places at the same time.
0.5;However, construction at \NDongaraji Temple began,
0.5;and your treasure was in \Ndanger of being dug up.
0.5;Mori-san, you were right. \NThe two cases were connected.
0.5;He thought he would bury the \Nmoney he stole to hide it.
0.5;Naturally, he chose a place \Nwhere no one would see him.
0.5;Shishido thought no one would see \Nhim there, but Eisaku-san did.
0.5;But Eisaku wouldn't have been \Nable to see him behind that tree.
0.5;While wandering around that night, Eisaku \Ndidn't come directly to Dongaraji Temple.
0.5;he did mention that the view of the \Nsunset from up there was exceptional.
0.5;He'd go up there all the time, \Nso he must've that evening, too.
0.5;The head priest said he wouldn't mention the \Nphone threat if they agreed to work for him.

0.5;Here it is, Dad!\NYou can take us tomorrow!
0.5;Why did I have to rent a car\Nand drive you around again?!
0.5;Hey, he's a detective, right?\NSo why doesn't he have a car of his own?
0.5;It sounds like he doesn't\Nusually drive much.
0.5;You're crazy if you think the shape\Nof the river will match a street.
0.5;What? You were the one who said\Nthe river flowed like a flow of cars!
0.5;Conan-kun wants you\Nto tell Inspector Megure.
0.5;Because you have a good track record,\Nplus he trusts you!
0.5;A good track record? You sure know\Nabout hard-to-understand things!
0.5;Come to the police headquarters\Nright away!
0.5;We've learned that one of our officers\Non vacation and his girlfriend
0.5;The fingerprints on the calculator\Nmatched his own when we checked.
0.5;The kidnappers probably took\NYamabe and his girlfriend, Eri-san,
0.5;and are threatening to kill her\Nif he doesn't shoot someone for them.
0.5;So what Conan-kun and the others\Nsaw was target practice for that?
0.5;But our hands are still tied since we\Ndon't know the most important facts:
0.5;It looks like this is the place.\NExcellent work!
0.5;Um, don't forget that I was\Nthe one who drove them here!
0.5;But we still don't know\Nwhen the attack will be...
0.5;It was around 1 pm\Nwhen the balloon burst, right?
0.5;Is that so? Then 1:00 must\Nbe the time of the attack!
0.5;They're keeping two people captive!\NThey don't have time to waste!
0.5;The sniper attack will\Nprobably be tomorrow!
0.5;If it were me, I would make sure to put\Nthe place and time in the message...
0.5;No matter how I look at it,\Nthe 3135134 still makes no sense!
0.5;Alright now. Don't make a move\Nuntil I give the order.
0.5;We have police snipers and a\Nhelicopter on standby at the river.
0.5;then the criminals should\Nappear by 12:00 at the latest.
0.5;Something's not right!\NWhy aren't they showing up?!
0.5;It was a mistake to\Nlisten to some stupid kid!
0.5;You can read the numbers even\Nwhen you flip the calculator over! Cool!
0.5;Heisei E? Wait, I could swear\NI've seen that somewhere before...
0.5;It was in the magazine\Nyou were looking at yesterday!
0.5;Wait, then that means this message\Nwas meant to be read upside-down!
0.5;Meaning that the 162 actually\Nmeans the 29th at 1:00!
0.5;Yamabe-san must have realized\Nthis upside-down trick
0.5;and tried to leave us this message\Nwhen he got the chance!
0.5;Heisei Express will be departing\Nfrom Platform 2 shortly.
0.5;He's sitting in the\Nvery front of the first car!
0.5;We still haven't found a curve\Nthat looks like the river!
0.5;Try any funny business\Nand the girl's dead.
0.5;There's no wind! The helicopter's speed\Nis 5 meters per second!
0.5;What're you doing?!\NThat's dangerous!
0.5;What a stroke of luck that\Nthis helmet just happened to hit him!
0.5;Here you are. Don't drop it\Non the way back, now!
0.5;Hey, Conan! That wasn't fair,\Nyou get all the fun!
0.5;Conan! No more sneaking off\Nwithout permission!
0.5;The men we arrested were former\Nmembers of the Oni Tora crime ring.
0.5;were all put behind bars\Nby a skilled public prosecutor.
0.5;The remaining members\Nwere forced to disband.
0.5;So it was that prosecutor\Nthey were after?
0.5;He was on his way home\Nfrom a trip with his family.
0.5;They're acting like\Nhe solved it all by himself.
0.5;But I'm sure he'll take us\Non vacation somewhere now!
0.5;Boy, it sure is hard to\Nconstantly act like a kid!
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shooting comet!
0.5;Conan's logic is the tonic for\Nhearts tired by modern society!
0.5;Today's the Kaitou Kid special!\NDetective and thief square off!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;I'm high school student\NKudo Shinichi.
0.5;I went with Mori Ran,\Nchildhood friend and classmate,
0.5;where I witnessed a suspicious\Ndeal involving a man in black.
0.5;I was so engrossed with watching\Nthat I didn't see his partner hiding!
0.5;I was knocked down\Nand given a poison.
0.5;When I woke up,\Nmy body had shrunk!
0.5;If they learned\NKudo Shinichi was alive,
0.5;After following Prof. Agasa's\Nadvice to conceal my identity,
0.5;Then, to uncover\Ninformation about them,
0.5;I moved in with Ran\Nand her detective father.
0.5;Your dad's a detective\Nand you never heard of him?!
0.5;That doesn't mean\NI love following crimes.
0.5;So you want my\Ndad to catch this thief?
0.5;Daddy submitted our family gem,\Nthe lucky Black Star pearl,
0.5;But why ask my\Ndad and not the police?
0.5;But if your dad catches him,\Nhe might let us see his face!
0.5;Yeah! Don't you\Nwonder what he looks like?!
0.5;It'd be nice if he\Nwas like Brad Pitt!
0.5;And besides, I haven't\Neven changed bodies!
0.5;Anyway, do they really want me to\Ncatch this Kaitou something-or-other?
0.5;No one's really\Nsure where it comes from.
0.5;According to Sonoko, he steals art\Nand jewels from all over the world,
0.5;"""International Criminal Number""\Nor Interpol number was 1412."
0.5;The leading theory is that people\Nlearned the number and it just stuck!
0.5;Apparently he has a different\Nname in Japan, though.
0.5;I don't think it was\Nanything that old man-like.
0.5;Oh, yeah. I have a\Ncopy of a weird warning letter
0.5;that Kaitou #1412\Nsent to Sonoko's house.
0.5;It doesn't make any sense!\NIt's like a code!
0.5;When the moon splits the two,\NI shall enter upon waves
0.5;Yeah, Sonoko's father tore\Nit up in anger when it arrived
0.5;"All I do get is that ""April Fools""\Nmeans he'll show up on April 1st..."
0.5;It's like all the police in\NTokyo have been mobilized...
0.5;I guess he really is\Na big international thief!
0.5;All that work and\NI still didn't break the code...
0.5;I truly appreciate your\Nlistening to my daughter!
0.5;We're counting on you,\NDetective Mori!
0.5;Sure you will! You haven't\Neven cracked the code yet!
0.5;So this is the largest black\Npearl in the world, the Black Star?
0.5;Yes. The Suzuki family has\Nbeen blessed with prosperity
0.5;ever since my\Ngrandfather first purchased it.
0.5;Security sure is tight\Nfor the day before the theft.
0.5;Yes. All we got from\Nthe letter was the date.
0.5;I'm told that security will be\Non full detail starting tonight--
0.5;I already told you! The river!\NDeploy men along the river bank!
0.5;"The ""enter upon waves""\Nbit refers to the Teimuzu River!"
0.5;The Teimuzu River is the only\Nplace in the vicinity with waves!
0.5;"Don't you get it? ""Waves"" means the ocean,\Nwhich means ""oki"" (coast)."
0.5;In other words, the idol star\Nwho performs live tomorrow
0.5;at the nearby Beika Town Hall,\NOkino Yoko-chan!
0.5;"What's more, her last\Nsong will be ""Moon Lady""!"
0.5;"""When the moon splits\Nthe two"" means that..."
0.5;...Kaitou #1412 will come from\Nthe vicinity of Beika Town Hall
0.5;Alright! Have Teams C through E\Nassemble near Beika Town Hall!
0.5;Still, I haven't broken\Nthe code either...
0.5;The inspector? He took some\Nofficers somewhere this morning...
0.5;Anyway, it's 2:00!\NWhy don't we have lunch nearby?
0.5;Checking the direction\Nwith my watch.
0.5;Yeah. First, you point the\Nhour hand toward the sun.
0.5;Japan's in the northern hemisphere,\Nso halfway between it and 12
0.5;I was just testing something\NShinichi-niichan told me, of course!
0.5;Which means south is at\N1 o'clock, and southeast at 2:30!
0.5;Aha! I've figured you out,\NKaitou #1412!
0.5;You want me to find\Nout about Kaitou #1412?
0.5;Please, Professor.\NHe should be in my dad's crime files.
0.5;I want to know about\Nhim before I meet him!
0.5;...the face of a retro thief who sends\Nwarning notices in this day and age!
0.5;"The ""two"" in ""when\Nthe moon splits the two"""
0.5;And if the splitting refers to the moon\Ncreating an eclipse between them...
0.5;Yes! The Black Star's initials\Nare BS (Broadcast Satellite)!
0.5;"If the ""waves"" refer to\Na satellite signal..."
0.5;...then he'll be coming from\Nthe direction of the BS signal!
0.5;The BS signal is sent from\Nsouth to west at a 45 degree angle
0.5;The only place that fits the bill\Nis the roof of the Haido City Hotel!
0.5;Inspector! A strange kid ran\Ninto the hotel! What do we do?!
0.5;Nothing. There's only\None person I'm after.
0.5;And not even he\Ncould dress up as a child.
0.5;Beika Museum is...\Nright around there.
0.5;I checked your dad's files\Nwith recent newspaper articles.
0.5;Kaitou #1412 is enveloped\Nin quite a bit of mystery.
0.5;His first appearance\Nwas in Paris eighteen years ago.
0.5;He suddenly disappeared ten\Nyears later and was presumed dead,
0.5;but he's back after eight years\Nand is primarily active in Japan.
0.5;Eighteen years ago?\NHe must be pretty old then...
0.5;"""The Modern Lupin,""\N""The Moonlight Magician""..."
0.5;A young novelist interested\Nin the crafty Kaitou #1412
0.5;once jokingly read\Nthe number like so...
0.5;That's right.\NKaitou #1412 is known as...
0.5;so as not to disturb\Nthe stillness of the night.
0.5;I can't make out his face,\Nbut he's surprisingly young.
0.5;His thirties. Twenties?\NNo, even younger!
0.5;Yes. Above the Haido City Hotel,\Nsouthwest of the museum.
0.5;Shall I check it out,\NCommissioner?
0.5;Look! A helicopter!\NI think it noticed!
0.5;Shouldn't you be escaping,\NKaitou Kid-san?
0.5;The helicopter will\Nbe here any minute.
0.5;I only have one chance to\Nget him with my tranquilizer gun!
0.5;The instant he\Nturns away to escape!
0.5;Chaki here! Kaitou Kid sighted\Non top of the Haido City Hotel!
0.5;Attention all patrol\Ncars in Beika and Haido
0.5;and all helicopters\Nin the air above Beika!
0.5;Proceed to the scene at once\Nand capture the Kaitou Kid!
0.5;Attention all officers\Ninside the Haido City Hotel!
0.5;The Kid's on the roof! Rush\Nto the scene at once! Seize him!
0.5;He can imitate any\Nvoice without a machine!
0.5;That's insane!\NWhy on earth would he do that?!
0.5;Oh, my. Inspector Nakamori.\NYou certainly arrived quickly.
0.5;Ha! You knew I cracked your\Ncode and had the place staked out!
0.5;I figured you might hang-glide in,\Nso I checked everyone in the hotel
0.5;but I never expected you to go\Naround Toto Tower and then land here.
0.5;Forget about the pearl!\NYou have nowhere to run!
0.5;I'm only here to observe you tonight.\NI don't plan to steal anything.
0.5;Oh? I clearly wrote\Nso at the start of the letter!
0.5;A kaitou is a creative artist\Nwho skillfully steals his prey,
0.5;but a detective is\Nnothing more than a critic
0.5;who finds fault in\Nwhat is left behind!
0.5;It only shows our\Nthree helicopters in the area!
0.5;"""On March 19th, I will appear\Non the Queen Selizabeth"
0.5;leaving from Yokohama Port\Nto steal the real Black Star.
0.5;Please cancel it,\NCommissioner Chaki!
0.5;We can't let him get near the jewel\Nwith such lousy security as that!
0.5;Don't be like that,\NNakamori-kun!
0.5;Tonight's party is\Nfull of important people!
0.5;Besides, we'll lose face if we\Ncancel the party out of fear of him!
0.5;Don't worry. It'll take three hours\Nfor the ship to get to Tokyo.
0.5;It's a floating prison! Even if he\Ndoes get on, he's like a rat in a trap!
0.5;This year marks Suzuki\NIndustries' 60th anniversary.
0.5;This is entirely because\Nof the support from you all.
0.5;Please forget about\Nsneak thieves for tonight
0.5;and enjoy this elegant and grand\Nparty to which 500 have been invited!
0.5;Please open the small boxes\Ngiven to you before you boarded.
0.5;They are my letter of challenge\Nto any foolish thieves.
0.5;as well as the Kaitou Kid's\Nprey tonight! The Black Star!
0.5;Only one is real, of course.\NAnd only I know to whom it was given.
0.5;Now, then.\NPlease put them on your chests
0.5;"and tell the Kid, ""Go ahead\Nand take it, if you dare""!"
0.5;Of course, that's assuming he\Nmanages to determine which one is real
0.5;That's my line!\NDo you know what time it is?!
0.5;Now I see! He got on\Nboard disguised as the president!
0.5;Eh?! Kaitou #1412 disguised\Nhimself as Daddy to get on the ship?!
0.5;I just found his disguise\Nand props in the bathroom!
0.5;But this is him. I doubt\Nthey'll find any evidence...
0.5;Out looking for you,\Nsince you didn't come back.
0.5;She was worried\NKaitou #1412 had caught you.
0.5;His name is Kaitou Kid!\NGet it right!
0.5;Inspector Nakamori. He works\Nfull-time pursuing the Kaitou Kid.
0.5;All 500 people here\Nare wearing black pearls!
0.5;And except for the real one,\Nthey're all imitations!
0.5;I can't guard it unless\NI know which one is real...
0.5;They all look alike,\Nbut they're still imitations.
0.5;"Close scrutiny could\Nnarrow it down a bit;"
0.5;among them are dull\Nand dreary ones such as mine
0.5;and excessively\Nshiny rubbish such as yours.
0.5;But checking every\Nperson in this crowd would be...
0.5;The Black Star, the black pearl\Nwith a peacock-green luster
0.5;is with someone\Nespecially worthy of it.
0.5;Coincidentally, that someone\Nis one out of five hundred...
0.5;It must be a woman,\Nif the jewel suits them...
0.5;Yes! Thanks to this fine\Nwoman and the president,
0.5;The guy from the\NYotsui girl's birthday party...
0.5;But you'll seem suspicious\Nif you don't wear it.
0.5;This is the Suzuki\NIndustries party, all right.
0.5;It's teeming with rich kids\Nand company presidents.
0.5;She's probably lost somewhere!\NRan has no sense of direction!
0.5;but that pesky villain has\Nsomehow boarded the ship!
0.5;As you know,\Nhe's a master of disguise!
0.5;to learn about his target\Nand fully imitate them,
0.5;even down to their face,\Nvoice, and personality!
0.5;Normally, we would carefully\Ninspect each and every person,
0.5;Pair up with the person next\Nto you and decide on a password!
0.5;I get it! That way he\Ncan't keep disguising himself,
0.5;which will allow the\Npolice to single him out!
0.5;The Black Star is\Nalready in my hands.
0.5;I'll just have to punish\Nthis scheming boy.
0.5;My guards caught him\Nin the tablecloth
0.5;after I pretended to shoot\Nhim with this model gun.
0.5;Yes. He's a brilliant magician\NI hired as entertainment...
0.5;I see. Kaitou Kid is an expert magician--\Nthe perfect role for you.
0.5;The two of us do happen to\Nbe artists who deceive the eyes...
0.5;...but I'm a magician by nature.\NA thief is no match for me!
0.5;A kaitou is a creative artist\Nwho skillfully steals his prey,
0.5;but a detective is\Nnothing more than a critic
0.5;who finds fault\Nin what is left behind!
0.5;Hold on. I've always\Nbeen the skeptical type.
0.5;Certainly. Would any\Nothers like to as well?
0.5;The black pearl is with\Nsomeone especially worthy of it.
0.5;That's all right! Spilled cards\Nwon't ruin my luck (tsuki).
0.5;Say, didn't you have a\Nlist of everyone at this party?
0.5;Wait! First, let me use my\NX-ray eye to read your minds
0.5;"""As Caesar was with Cleopatra,\NI am already by your side."
0.5;Hey! Nakamori-kun! Don't tell\Nme it's already been stolen!
0.5;No, he doesn't have it yet,\Nnor has he escaped!
0.5;He's simply confusing us\Nto make things work his way!
0.5;He's a human being\Nwho relies on tricks!
0.5;Yep! It was on\Nthe card Ran just picked!
0.5;But when and how\Ndid he put this in there?!
0.5;The Kid is crafty!\NEverything about him is a mystery!
0.5;All we know is that he's\Nsomewhere in here!
0.5;Does that mean he knows\Nwhere the real pearl is?!
0.5;Even if he did,\Nthis is a floating prison.
0.5;Could he possibly\Nmake off with the Black Star
0.5;Inspector! We'll arrive in\NTokyo Harbor in thirty minutes!
0.5;Alright! Seal all the exits!\NLet no one outside!
0.5;Time to show yourself,\NKaitou Kid!
0.5;This is your only chance to\Nstrike while everyone's restless!
0.5;Excuse me! Could someone\Npick up that pearl?
0.5;What?! So you were\Nwearing the real one?!
0.5;A letter declaring the upcoming theft\Nof the Suzuki family's Black Star
0.5;Upon cracking his code, I waited\Nfor him atop the Haido City Hotel.
0.5;so as not to disturb\Nthe stillness of the night.
0.5;I only had one chance\Nto use my tranquilizer gun!
0.5;But instead of running, he imitated\Nmultiple voices without a machine
0.5;to lure the police in,\Nand then vanished like smoke!
0.5;the Suzuki Industries' 60th anniversary\Nboat party began as scheduled.
0.5;Sonoko's mother,\NSuzuki Tomoko, devised a plan
0.5;that looked to spell\Nfailure for the Kaitou Kid,
0.5;but he blew up the pearls and stole\Nthe Black Star during the confusion!
0.5;No. We checked all the passengers\Nwho left the room earlier, but...
0.5;He has to be on board still!\NCheck every last person on the ship!
0.5;But how did he know she was\Nwearing the real Black Star?!
0.5;This is the engine room,\NConan-kun!
0.5;Say, Ran-neechan. Do you\Nknow about the language of jewels?
0.5;Of the passengers on board,\Nthe only woman with moons in her name
0.5;But how does that\Ntell you who the Kid is?
0.5;You know how the card\Nyou chose had his message?
0.5;It's a basic trick in which the magician\Nused the pigeon in his right hand
0.5;to distract the audience while\Nhe switched decks in his left hand.
0.5;So the chosen card would be\Nfixed regardless of who cut the deck.
0.5;So if the message\Nwas on that card...
0.5;...does that mean\NKaitou Kid was that magician?!
0.5;No! I watched the whole time,\Nbut he never got near the lady!
0.5;There's one other person\Nwho could've switched cards!
0.5;Yes! That person made them fall,\Npretended to pick them up,
0.5;then removed a card\Nand added the message!
0.5;They hid it in their palm and\Npretended to pull it from the deck!
0.5;This is Chopper #1!\NHe hasn't fled outside!
0.5;This is Surveillance!\NSonar and radar show nothing!
0.5;All onboard officers are\Nto split up onto each floor
0.5;Don't let a familiar face fool you!\NHe's a master of disguise!
0.5;Yes. You switched places with\NRan when she left to find me.
0.5;After becoming Ran, you agitated\Neveryone with your message
0.5;and scattered the exploding\Npearls to cause mass panic.
0.5;You then stole the real Black\NStar during the confusion
0.5;The fact that you prepared\Nthose fireworks means you knew
0.5;she had a large number\Nof replicas made.
0.5;I didn't know which one was\Nreal, and I didn't have any hints!
0.5;You didn't need hints to\Nknow which one was real!
0.5;Once she took her pearl\Nout with a glove, that is.
0.5;Pearls are made of calcium carbonate\Nand are highly reactive to acid.
0.5;Oil in the fingers would oxidize\Nthe surface and make it lose its luster.
0.5;...Realized that she'd never give\Nsuch a delicate jewel to anyone else!
0.5;But add her dull pearl to the equation\Nand speculation becomes certainty!
0.5;Yes. Just as old pearls in famous\Nmuseums fade in color over time,
0.5;a pearl's luster lasts\Na few decades at most.
0.5;"The Black Star was\Npurchased sixty years ago;"
0.5;once you saw her carefully\Nhandle her faded pearl with gloves!
0.5;I was so concerned with\Nyou that I completely forgot!
0.5;But wasn't the Black Star\Nin the museum all shiny?
0.5;That's why you didn't take it.\NYou knew it was a fake.
0.5;Then you challenged\Nher in your second letter
0.5;"You even made\Nsure to write ""the real one."""
0.5;You didn't call for the\Npolice that time to spite me!
0.5;You acted like you were\Nabout to hang-glide out,
0.5;but you quickly dressed up\Nas an officer during the flash,
0.5;Besides, it's senseless\Nto ask for help here...
0.5;...I set up this 1-on-1\Nmatch out of respect
0.5;for the criminal artist who snuck\Non board amidst all the security.
0.5;Yes. Most great artists\Nbecome famous after they die.
0.5;I'll make you a great\Nmaster, Kaitou Kid.
0.5;Once I place you in\Nthe cemetery known as jail.
0.5;I surrender.\NI'll give up on this pearl.
0.5;Oh, yeah! The girl I knocked\Nout to get these clothes...
0.5;What's she doing in here?\NAnyway, let's get her out...
0.5;"""This crimson dress you gave me\Nthe other day suits you wonderfully."
0.5;They later found the hang glider\NKaitou Kid planned to escape with,
0.5;but he, himself, had completely\Nvanished from the ship.
0.5;"There you are! ""Grade-schooler\NProtects Black Star!"""
0.5;He was surprisingly young.\NIn his twenties, or maybe...
0.5;Falling into the ocean while touring\Nthe Selizabeth! Talk about stupid!
0.5;Maybe the guy\Nyou saw in Shibuya was...
0.5;The Case of the Eminent Family's\NStrange Deaths, Part 1.
0.5;As times change, difficult cases\Nget more complicated!
0.5;Today marks the 2nd year of\NConan! He gets into big trouble fast!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;It's been a long time since\Nyour parents transferred overseas
0.5;and left you here!\NDon't you miss them?
0.5;Though they really are overseas\Nright now, so it's not exactly a lie...
0.5;Wasn't it Professor Agasa\Nwho brought him here?
0.5;Why not? Is contacting them\Nbad or something?
0.5;N-Not good! I gotta act quick\Nor they'll find out I'm Kudo Shinichi!
0.5;Dear me! He's just being sulky,\Nafter being left alone all this time...
0.5;I appreciate everything!\NI'll give you my thanks another day!
0.5;Bye, Conan-kun! Send us\Na letter when you get there!
0.5;Yes. Your mother was a beautiful\NJapanese actress who enchanted men
0.5;all over the world and won all the\Nmajor awards at the young age of 19.
0.5;But she fell in love with\Nthe young novelist Kudo Yusaku,
0.5;She later had a son, but left\Nhim behind to travel the world
0.5;with Kudo Yusaku, now an\Ninternational-renowned mystery writer.
0.5;Isn't that right,\NKudo Shinichi-kun, their son?
0.5;Is she with those men in black\Nwho shrunk me with their drug?!
0.5;Stay still, and I'll take you to\Na nice place... A more fun place...
0.5;"Was it because I used\Nthe name ""Kudo Shinichi"""
0.5;And then they heard from\Nsomewhere that I was still alive...
0.5;Dammit! I told the inspector\Nnot to mention my name!
0.5;What now, Kudo Shinichi? Should\NI go back and tell Ran everything?
0.5;No, they'd be in danger\Nif I go back now...
0.5;Yes, I was careless. But it seems\Nthe boy really is Kudo Shinichi...
0.5;OK. Look for him. It'll be\Na pain if he goes to the cops.
0.5;Guess my only choice is\Nto talk with Prof. Agasa,
0.5;But what's taking him so long?\NWhere is he wandering around now?!
0.5;Where am I?!\NSeems to be a kitchen, but...
0.5;The organization wants him,\Nas an example of the drug's side-effects!
0.5;Who is that masked man?!\NOh, crap! He's coming!
0.5;Still, is that really high\Nschool detective Kudo Shinichi?
0.5;But the day Kudo Shinichi\Nwent missing coincides
0.5;with the day that boy\Nappeared at that agency,
0.5;and all the crimes that happened\Naround him were solved easily.
0.5;The only thing I can think of is\Nthat the drug really did shrink him...
0.5;I have some of\Ntheir latest poison, too.
0.5;The man we're\Ndealing with tomorrow.
0.5;As soon as the deal is done,\Nwe're supposed to get rid of him.
0.5;What if we do find\Nout it shrinks people?
0.5;For now, we'll just kill the\Nman we're dealing with, and then...
0.5;Our orders are to take him back\Nso they can investigate its side-effects!
0.5;They can't let\Npeople know its secrets!
0.5;We're doing things my way.\NDon't give me another corpse to carry!
0.5;Anyway, did you tell the man\Nwhere tomorrow's deal is going down?
0.5;The deal is at 1:00 pm.\NGet sleep until then.
0.5;Yikes! He's sleeping with it on!\NTalk about creepy!
0.5;Anyway, I need to get these\Nropes off and get outta here!
0.5;Looks like I'm in the clear.\NOkay! Now to use a shard to...
0.5;...but how do I get\Nout of this upstairs room?
0.5;Even with the snow,\Nit'd be too dangerous to jump out...
0.5;Guess my only choice is\Nto hide in that fridge...
0.5;Oh! That wine must\Nbe dripping somewhere...
0.5;Yeah! He was gone when I got up!\NHe must've gone out the window!
0.5;He used the snow as a cushion\Nto get down! He's not getting away!
0.5;What're you doing?!\NLet's go find him!
0.5;He pretended to escape,\Nand is waiting for us to leave.
0.5;After today's deal,\Nwe'll find and eliminate him.
0.5;Thank goodness I found this\Nstorage area beneath the mat then...
0.5;Alright! Guess I'll look for\Nthat drug while I have the chance!
0.5;Professor Agasa said we could\Nfind a way to make me normal again
0.5;I guess he took\Nit all for today's deal...
0.5;What's with this newspaper?\NIt has holes all over it...
0.5;They must've cut out\Nletters to make a message
0.5;That's right! They said they're\Ngoing to kill that guy! This is bad!
0.5;I hafta find out where the deal is,\Nstop the murder, and get the drug!
0.5;Guessing the missing letters\Ngives I, Te, Ho, Be, Ru, and Ka.
0.5;But it doesn't specify where in the hotel.\NAre any other letters missing?
0.5;Ah! It was the August\Npage above it that was cut!
0.5;Which means the August day\Nabove September 27th is... 30!
0.5;"""Beika Hotel 30!""\NThat's where their deal is going down!"
0.5;This hotel only has nineteen floors,\Nand there's no Room #30...
0.5;That's strange.\NWe only have up to #26...
0.5;Not good! It's already past noon!\NAnd the deal is at 1:00!
0.5;No, it's not like that! I just\Nthought it was a cool car!
0.5;These people seem\Ncompletely unrelated...
0.5;"There's a small ""1"" written\Nin chalk next to the ""30""!"
0.5;"Ah! ""301"" must be\Na room number at this hotel!"
0.5;And he's probably\Nthe guy they're dealing with!
0.5;That masked man will kill me\Nfor sure if he catches me again!
0.5;What do I do?! What do I do?!\NWhat do I do?!
0.5;OK, Masao. The door locks by itself,\Nso you just need to close it!
0.5;Shh! I'm not a bad guy!\NI'm Space Detective Conan,
0.5;I'm here to catch evil\Naliens from Planet Ranpo!
0.5;Just you wait! I'm gonna\Ncall the cops on you!
0.5;I'm from Planet Ranpo!\NI can use any voice at all!
0.5;Wow! That's awesome!\NYou really are a space detective!
0.5;There sure is! For now,\NI'd like to use your phone,
0.5;It's fine. I am feeling hungry.\NHave it brought in.
0.5;Let me first introduce\Nour other guest...
0.5;Other guest?! Don't tell me\Nthat boy's under here!
0.5;The cart's a decoy.\NHe's really... inside this closet!
0.5;While we were talking\Nwith the bellboy,
0.5;he put gum in the door\Nto defeat the automatic lock.
0.5;He then snuck in while\Nwe were focused on the cart.
0.5;Did you think\NI'd fall for such a trick?
0.5;Damn! My only choice\Nis my Anesthetic Watch Gun--
0.5;I had that interesting watch of\Nyours disabled after we caught you.
0.5;You'll regret the day\Nyou underestimated me...
0.5;The world-famous\Nmystery writer, Kudo Yusaku!
0.5;Don't be so mad!\NWe were worried too, you know!
0.5;Yeah, Shin-chan! We stopped\Nby the house and you were gone!
0.5;And then Prof. Agasa\Ntold you about how I shrank,
0.5;And you successfully followed\Nall of our clues to make it this far!
0.5;Everything was just as I had\Ncalculated, until you were shot.
0.5;So then you knew I was hiding\Nin that kitchen's storage area?!
0.5;Of course! Well, you just\Nbarely passed as a detective,
0.5;but it's your own fault for\Nnot realizing I was dressed as
0.5;the Night Baron\Ncharacter from my novels!
0.5;You idiot! That was no time for that!\NI thought I was about to die!
0.5;Oh, is that so? Well, what do you\Nsay we leave this dangerous country
0.5;We did this so you would\Nrealize the situation you're in!
0.5;That's why I helped out\Nwith their act, Shinichi-kun!
0.5;I have friends in the Interpol.\NI'll have 'em look into this organization.
0.5;They'll get the drug at some point,\Nand you can be returned to normal.
0.5;So let's put an end to this\Ndangerous detective game you're--
0.5;Plus, I can't afford\Nto leave Japan yet.
0.5;It's all right.\NLet's humor him for a while.
0.5;But the instant things get dangerous,\Nwe're taking you overseas.
0.5;As it seems you have other\Nreasons for not wanting to leave...
0.5;Of course! I'd be delighted\Nto take care of your adorable
0.5;Please take care of him for me.\NIt seems he likes you.
0.5;Dropping my manuscripts and\Nescaping to Japan was worth it!
0.5;Don't worry. He'll admit\Ndefeat sooner or later.
0.5;Hey! What do you say\Nto a trip around the world?!
0.5;It's the foreign magazine editors!\NHow'd they find me?!
0.5;T-This knife!\NRyoji was behind this!
0.5;two actresses competing for \Npopularity on their blogs.
0.5;However, concerned that Kyona-san wasn't \Ngetting up in time for her film shoot,
0.5;With the same feelings we've \Nalways held still in our hearts,
0.5;The key to solving the locked \Nroom case is an ordinary toy.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Have you figured out\Nhow she locked the room?
0.5;But I know how she got in and \Nwhat she used for a weapon.
0.5;The murder victim seemed \Nmalicious, rude, and vulgar,
0.5;you'll see she had a surprisingly \Nsensitive and conscientious side, too.
0.5;Her nail polish bottles were \Narranged in numerical order.
0.5;They're even a brand that you have \Nto turn over to see the number.
0.5;Shouldn't you go home \Nand eat a proper dinner?
0.5;But my parents are at a meeting \Nfor the shopping center.
0.5;My mom gets mad when I eat too much, \Nso let's get some kind of snack.
0.5;You had all that cake earlier, \Nand you still want snacks?
0.5;I bought the ingredients so I \Ncould try making it tomorrow.
0.5;Yes. Cooking rice isn't the only \Nthing a rice cooker can do.
0.5;The culprit locked the room without \Nusing it for its intended purpose,
0.5;but the culprit entered the \Nroom and murdered the victim.
0.5;And despite the doors of this \Nhotel not automatically locking,
0.5;the key card was in the bedroom, \Nwhich is far from the door.
0.5;We have no idea how the culprit \Nescaped after committing the murder.
0.5;On top of that, we still haven't found the \Nrod-like weapon used to kill the victim.
0.5;All we know is that the victim \Nis actress Shono Kyona-san,
0.5;Should we ask the commissioner \Nfor instructions?
0.5;Professor Agasa is waiting \Nfor you in room 504.
0.5;Directly under this one \Nin the murderer's room.
0.5;I'm sure it's difficult for you to \Nunderstand, but the room was locked, and...
0.5;Why am I being suspected \Nof killing Kyona-san?
0.5;The key card was in the middle of her \Nroom, so it's a locked room case, right?
0.5;On top of that, Kyona-san said she'd \Nonly open the door for Sakurako-san.
0.5;You'll see how she entered the room \Nif you look through the peep hole.
0.5;We recorded a video of \Nthe professor on a phone
0.5;Th-Then when I saw the professor \Nearlier, was that...?
0.5;Just like Saya-san did when \Nshe entered Kyona-san's room.
0.5;Saya-san recorded a video of \NSakurako-san with her phone
0.5;I didn't have time to \Nrecord a video like that!
0.5;Sakurako-san, when Saya-san \Nasked you to come to her room,
0.5;There was an envelope with a \Nlarge black heart drawn on it
0.5;stuck to Saya-san's door \Njust below the peep hole.
0.5;lining up the phone's camera with \Nthe hole, and setting it to record,
0.5;she was able to take a video of \NSakurako-san ringing the doorbell.
0.5;Both Kyona-san and Saya-san's rooms \Nare at the end of the hallway.
0.5;The background in the video would \Nlook just like her hallway.
0.5;so how did the culprit lock \Nthe door after leaving?
0.5;By using this toy helicopter you \Nwere flying around the cake buffet.
0.5;First, you tape a long string to \Nthe rotor shaft of the propeller
0.5;After wrapping tape around the end of \Nthe string attached to the rotor shaft,
0.5;Once you gently tape the helicopter to \Nthe bedroom floor, you're ready to go.
0.5;All you have to do is pass the \Ntwo strings under the door,
0.5;slide the key card into the slot of the \Nlocked door, and turn on the helicopter.
0.5;the string is wound around the rotor shaft, \Nand the key card slides under the door.
0.5;I-I see. Instead of flying the helicopter, \Nshe used it to wind up the string.
0.5;To finish the trick, you just pull the string\Nattached to the back from outside the room.
0.5;If you pull really hard \Nonce it reaches the door...
0.5;As proof, remember the white cream \Non the floor next to the key card?
0.5;That's because there was cream on the \Nskids on the bottom of the helicopter.
0.5;Saya-san's helicopter crashed into \Nthe cake Genta was about to eat.
0.5;But, Conan-kun, the helicopter's \Nstill in the room.
0.5;Yeah. That's why Saya-san dropped her hat \Nthe moment she entered Kyona-san's room.
0.5;And if she stuck double-sided \Ntape on the inside,
0.5;it should stay even if \Nshe put it on the rack.
0.5;Inside her hat is the Petite Falcon \Nshe used to commit her crime.
0.5;I-I stuck the double-sided tape \Non there so my hat wouldn't slip.
0.5;Yeah, that's right. It must've gotten stuck \Nthere by coincidence when I dropped it.
0.5;When my Petite Falcon got caught in the AC \Nvent, you stood on the table to get it for me.
0.5;There were cups on the table, so \Nnormally a person wouldn't stand on it.
0.5;You can attach your phone to the end of a \Nselfie stick to take pictures of yourself.
0.5;It's a kind of tool. You can extend it to \Ntake pictures of yourself from far away.
0.5;Most of the pictures on Kyona-san's blog are \Nselfies, but Saya-san's has none at all.
0.5;so I used that stick to make sure \Nshe'd never open her mouth again!
0.5;While pretending to introduce \Nher favorite comics.
0.5;"In Japanese, ""hit and run"" \Nis a baseball term, but abroad..."
0.5;Two years ago, I ran over \Nsome drunk man with my car.
0.5;I'd been hiding it, but when I forced \Nmy way into her room, she told me.
0.5;Did you figure it out the code \Nin that photo of the comics?
0.5;Will you surrender our contest, or \Nwill you let your secret be exposed?
0.5;You might actually look \Ngood with a shaved head.
0.5;And you'd have me to thank \Nfor it, wouldn't you?
0.5;Saya-san, I'm not sure Kyona-san \Nknew about the hit and run...
0.5;"The code wasn't ""The \NHit and Run of Love,"""
0.5;"but the series next to it \Ncalled ""Looking to You."""
0.5;She's usually precise, but that series \Nalone was arranged out of order,
0.5;If you match the volumes to the 50 \Ncharacters of the Japanese alphabet,
0.5;read volume 29 as it is, and read \Nfrom the left, it forms a sentence...
0.5;In baseball terms, a hit \Nand run is a risky play.
0.5;Agasa-san, that was another impressive \Ndisplay of detective work.
0.5;I was surprised to learn \Nyou know the commissioner.
0.5;What? But isn't the commissioner \Nof Section One Matsumoto?
0.5;I'm Kuroda Hyoe. I've taken over as \Ncommissioner of Section One of the MPD.
0.5;And it's nice to see you \Nagain, Edogawa Conan-kun.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Disappointing and Kind Alien!"""
0.5;They hit him once in the \Nhead with a metal pipe.
0.5;I just happened to be passing by, \Nand it seemed like there was a case.
0.5;Anyway, are they the victim's \Nsurviving family members?
0.5;We had them come to confirm \Nthe identity of the body.
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!
0.5;A chance encounter with \Nyet another assault case!
0.5;The surprising true face \Nof a troubled family!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;The victim was Kadowaki Eiji-san, twenty-three \Nyears old, who lives down the way.
0.5;the victim went out to \Ndrink yesterday evening.
0.5;his family was waiting for \Nthe victim to return home.
0.5;Last night, his older brother Yuichi-san \Nwas staying at a hotel in the city
0.5;The victim Kadowaki Eiji-san didn't have a \Nvery good reputation in the neighborhood.
0.5;he hasn't been able to hold down \Na job and wanders the area.
0.5;Last Friday, he got drunk and \Nargued with a bar employee.
0.5;We also found two interesting \Npieces of information.
0.5;The first is passers-by reported \Nthat several days ago,
0.5;a well-built man in his thirties appeared \Nto be watching the Kadowaki family,
0.5;He was also questioning the neighbors \Nabout the Kadowaki family.
0.5;It's possible he had some trouble \Nwith that man and incurred his wrath.
0.5;According to the neighbors, it \Nseems the victim Kadowaki Eiji-san
0.5;would always stop his brother's \Nexplosive violence.
0.5;So the victim was the problem \Nchild of the Kadowaki family.
0.5;They say the worse a child is, \Nthe more you love them.
0.5;we'll have to question \Nthe older brother again.
0.5;Besides, what does that have \Nto do with Eiji's murder?
0.5;I know. Around ten, I ran \Ninto a woman at the hotel.
0.5;I would never do something \Nas stupid as kill a person!
0.5;According to your neighbors, your mother \Nhas been frequently injured since then.
0.5;And two years later, Eiji-san \Ndropped out of college.
0.5;You managed to protect your mother until then, \Nbut after that, you couldn't handle it anymore.
0.5;Furthermore, you've been \Nbusy with work lately,
0.5;he might do something \Nthat couldn't be undone.
0.5;We went to canvas the hotel \NYuichi-san was staying at.
0.5;It's all right. I wasn't \Nlooking where I was going.
0.5;The time displayed on the phone she \Npicked up was approximately ten.
0.5;Additionally, the hotel employee who \Nhappened to pass by witnessed the scene.
0.5;So he has multiple people \Nbacking up his alibi.
0.5;So I can leave now, right? \NMy alibi has been verified.
0.5;I'll never forget the humiliation I suffered \Nwhile being treated like a murder suspect.
0.5;It would be tragic if one brother killed \Nthe other out of concern for his mother.
0.5;I just finished checking some convenience \Nstore security camera footage for the man's face.
0.5;I was treated as a suspect \Nbecause of this man.
0.5;Rintaro-kun was rowdy and \Ncaused a lot of trouble.
0.5;He's not someone who could've \Nkilled another person.
0.5;Yes, last week at the \Nhosp—in the neighborhood.
0.5;What? Did you exchange addresses \Nor contact information then?
0.5;He just said he was working at a \Nconstruction site near Hinode Pier.
0.5;You're Takase Rintaro-san, correct? \NGraduated from Haido Elementary School One.
0.5;We're the police. Could we have \Na few minutes of your time?
0.5;He wasn't even surprised that \Nthe police suddenly showed up.
0.5;You've been asking around the neighborhood \Nabout the Kadowaki family recently.
0.5;Who suddenly feels nostalgic \Nabout someone they hated?
0.5;Takase-san, did you know that \NKadowaki Yasuko-san's younger son
0.5;We came to talk to you as \Npart of the investigation.
0.5;So, Takase-san, where were \Nyou at ten last night?
0.5;But if I wanted revenge, wouldn't I \Ngo after Kadowaki-sensei directly?
0.5;A parent's greatest treasure is their \Nchildren, no matter how old they are.
0.5;Maybe you wanted to make her sad \Nby taking the life of her son.
0.5;I see. The police have put \Na lot of thought into this.
0.5;Last night around ten, I was \Nin the middle of a three hour
0.5;He was facing the wall and kept \Nshouting about fighting spirit.
0.5;but aside from that, he was eating \Nand drinking the whole time.
0.5;I think it was three hours \Nstarting just after eight.
0.5;They're only installed \Nat the entrance, though.
0.5;We were able to confirm that he was at a bar \Nin Nebada from eight to 11, just like he said.
0.5;Well, I'm leaving now. \NGood luck with your job.
0.5;What? A fire at the \NKadowaki family residence?
0.5;They're going to determine \Nthe cause of death.
0.5;I'm terribly sorry to ask at this time, \Nbut could you tell us what happened?
0.5;When the fire broke out, I was sleeping \Nin my room on the second floor.
0.5;Perhaps it's because I'd been questioned by \Nthe police, but I had a terrible headache.
0.5;So by the time I realized something \Nwas amiss, it was a sea of fire.
0.5;It may be a coincidence, but I can't believe \Nhe lost his mother right after his brother.
0.5;Yuichi-san, can you think of anyone \Nwho might have resented you
0.5;Don't you think it's too \Nmuch of a coincidence?
0.5;That fire was just an \Nunfortunate coincidence.
0.5;He wasn't surprised at all that \Nthe police suddenly showed up.
0.5;Or when he heard Kadowaki \NEiji-san was murdered.
0.5;He was taken off the \Nsuspect list as a result.
0.5;But I don't think the Kadowaki family \Nresidence fire was a total coincidence.
0.5;You were just saying how I could've \Nkilled him, too, weren't you?
0.5;A black shadow\Nbeneath a chandelier!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;The Wealthy Daughter\NMurder Case (Part 1).
0.5;I humbly thank you\Nall for being here today!
0.5;May both she and the\NYotsui Group continue to prosper!
0.5;Stop eating like a pig!\NYou're embarrassing me!
0.5;Now then, allow me to\Nintroduce our special guest!
0.5;The truth is, he helped\Nmy daughter just yesterday!
0.5;You found Miss Reika's dog,\NBubble-chan!
0.5;Seriously. One look\Nfrom those sharp eyes
0.5;is all it takes to make\Na criminal confess.
0.5;The young lady\Nwas wise to choose you.
0.5;I don't know about you, but he seems\Nlike a middle-aged airhead to me.
0.5;but he's not\Nquite what I imagined...
0.5;is a preferred tactic\Nof all great detectives.
0.5;Not to mention\Nbeautiful and refined!
0.5;I dunno, but he's\Ngonna be one happy guy.
0.5;He gets to be the next\Nhead of the Yotsui Group!
0.5;"The lights in this\Nwashroom don't work;"
0.5;But that's odd. None of the\Nlights around here work.
0.5;All three of your\Ncars have flats, too...
0.5;The six of you will\Nhave to share cars with--
0.5;I refuse to be stuffed\Ninto someone else's car!
0.5;I'm staying here\Nwith Yone tonight!
0.5;Then I, too, will spend\Nthe night and protect her
0.5;Good idea. I can rest\Neasy with you on the job.
0.5;Fools. Her husband was\Nalready decided two years ago.
0.5;Yes! Stay a little longer\Nand tell us about your cases!
0.5;That's a pity. You were\None of my candidate suitors.
0.5;between my company and\Nyour old man's goes through.
0.5;All you can do is\Nchirp to soothe your owner!
0.5;You were all members\Nof the same yacht club?
0.5;We used to sail around\Nnearby islands in her boat!
0.5;Until the accident\Ntwo years ago, anyway!
0.5;We promised never\Nto talk about it again!
0.5;Sorry, but could you\Ntake a look in her room?
0.5;That's strange.\NShe isn't anywhere.
0.5;Maybe she left\Nand got lost in the forest?
0.5;Our only choice is to\Nsplit up and search the forest.
0.5;Someone probably\Nheld his head in this fountain.
0.5;That's terrible!\NWho would do such a thing?!
0.5;Don't bother. There's\Nno phone reception out here.
0.5;Our only option now is\Nto use the detective's car.
0.5;Yeah. Someone could\Ntake it and get the police...
0.5;Which means someone\Nwants to keep us here.
0.5;We'll just have to wait\Nuntil the cars come tomorrow.
0.5;Say, what kind of accident\Nhappened at the yacht club
0.5;Don't be stupid.\NThat's got nothing to do with this.
0.5;Before he was killed,\NNikaido-san said that
0.5;Reika-sama's husband\Nwas decided two years ago.
0.5;It might have something\Nto do with this.
0.5;Yeah. Looks like\Nwe'll need you to talk
0.5;It happened during a storm.\NMost unfortunate.
0.5;we landed on a small island\Nand went off on our own.
0.5;Little did we know\Na storm was coming.
0.5;The island was so small\Nthat the full tide could submerge it.
0.5;One of us took\Na life raft to rescue her.
0.5;but the person who went to\Nget them was never seen again.
0.5;Until the drowned body was\Nfound three days later, anyway.
0.5;She sacrificed her life\Nto rescue Reika-sama.
0.5;At any rate, first we need\Nto find Reika-sama.
0.5;Let's split into two groups\Nand check the house again.
0.5;let's make sure\Nno one gets separated.
0.5;Good idea! It's safer\Nif we watch each other!
0.5;You must be tired\Nfrom all that's happened.
0.5;The power's out.\NDid something happen upstairs?!
0.5;Yone-san!\NWhat are you doing here?!
0.5;I followed you\Nwhen you scurried outside!
0.5;Whew, she's just asleep.\NShe had me scared!
0.5;This would normally\Nwake a person up.
0.5;Was there sleeping\Nmedicine in her coffee?!
0.5;Huh? Didn't the\Nold man leave this open?
0.5;I think someone\Ngave her sleeping pills.
0.5;Didn't you and\NRan make the coffee?
0.5;The fact that she was attacked\Njust because she was here
0.5;means that these might\Nbe random murders!
0.5;You were with her when\Nthe power went out, right?
0.5;12:30! That's when\Nthe power went out!
0.5;All the air conditioners\Nwere set to go on at 12:30!
0.5;Now I know how\Nthe killer cut the lights!
0.5;The killer is someone\Nin this mansion!
0.5;It's too dangerous\Nto stay in your room alone!
0.5;The cars will\Nbe here in three hours!
0.5;when one of\Nyou might be a killer!
0.5;Here is today's\Nweather for the Kanto region.
0.5;They made it while\NI was in the bathroom.
0.5;The two murders\Nwere done the exact same way!
0.5;You're the only one\Nwho could've done it!
0.5;High school student Shinichi was\Nforced to take a drug that shrunk him!
0.5;Although smaller, my mind\Nremains that of a sharp detective!
0.5;Time for another two-part episode!\NKogoro's club reunion!
0.5;Even when old friendships fall apart,\Nthere's always only one truth!
0.5;Why won't you\Ntake us to your reunion?!
0.5;You took me to the one\Nfive years ago, though.
0.5;"But we can't\Nlet the office close;"
0.5;But with you on vacation, the office\Nwould be closed no matter what.
0.5;We want to go to the hot\Nspring, too! Right, Conan-kun?
0.5;Actually, I was going to treat you\Nto a fancy meal instead of taking you!
0.5;Then we'll pass on the meal\Nand take the hot spring trip instead!
0.5;Domestic flights are even more\Nexpensive than international ones lately!
0.5;I don't wanna pay for three stinking people!\NPut yourself in my shoes!
0.5;Amazing! You caught\Na bank robber, Dad!
0.5;when the great detective\NMori Kogoro is on the case!
0.5;Boy! How did you\Nmake that brick do that?
0.5;I thought he was going to shoot\Nyou so I kicked it without thinking
0.5;Then you're obligated\Nto take the person
0.5;who saved your\Nlife to the hot spring!
0.5;And I'll come as\NConan-kun's guardian!
0.5;Are you coming to the reunion\Nat the hot spring again?
0.5;Excellent work,\NMori Kogoro-dono!
0.5;Hey, you're not going to take\Nthe gun the robber had?
0.5;Don't tell me someone\Non this street ran off with it
0.5;We need to tell HQ\Nand get it back now!
0.5;Eating while on a trip\Nis the best thing ever!
0.5;Why do I have to take\Nthat little brat to the reunion?
0.5;What's the problem? You took\Nme to the one five years ago.
0.5;You were little at the time,\Nso I couldn't leave you at home alone.
0.5;You wouldn't be able\Nto attend this reunion
0.5;if Conan-kun hadn't\Nsaved your life, you know!
0.5;I could've caught that guy\Neasy enough without the kid's help!
0.5;Say, did they ever find\Nthat missing gun?
0.5;Yeah, what's the deal?\NThe police haven't announced anything...
0.5;Apparently the police\Nare investigating really hard,
0.5;but it hasn't been used\Nin any other crimes
0.5;and they don't seem\Nto have any leads, either.
0.5;The gun was a\NSmith and Wesson M439.
0.5;That robber doesn't know\Nmuch about guns.
0.5;No, the gun didn't\Nbreak when I hit it!
0.5;So if he actually\Ndid pay money for it,
0.5;It sure is good\Nto see you all again.
0.5;...that everyone from the Beika\NUniversity Judo Club has been together.
0.5;This sure brings back memories\Nof all those days of intense practice...
0.5;Who're you to talk?\NYou rarely ever came to practice!
0.5;That's right!\NYou constantly ditched practice
0.5;because you thought geniuses\Ndidn't need to train! Right, Mori-kun?
0.5;In the end, you were the only\None who never won a single match.
0.5;You were lying whenever you\Nboasted that you were invincible
0.5;during your college days,\Nweren't you, Dad?
0.5;Hey, Ran-chan!\NIt's good to see you again!
0.5;But that sure was fun,\Nscrubbing each other's back!
0.5;The bath must've rushed\Nthe blood to your head.
0.5;You sure he's not overexcited\Nfrom seeing you naked?
0.5;Of course he's not!\NHe's still a kid, you know!
0.5;I am so dead if she\Nfinds out who I really am!
0.5;Oh, so this is the boy\NMori-kun is taking care of!
0.5;I'm Beika University's\Njudo ace, Ayashiro!
0.5;I'm Omura Jun, our judo club's\Nbiggest risk-taker.
0.5;"I was our so-called\N""point-getter""!"
0.5;I'm Horikoshi Yumi, the beautiful\Nmanager of the judo club!
0.5;and I also was the manager\Nand idol of the judo club!
0.5;"I'm Nakamichi Kazushi; I was\Ncaptain and central pillar of the team!"
0.5;I'm a police detective\Nin Chiba prefecture!
0.5;Of course, unlike this guy,\NI haven't quit my job halfway through.
0.5;Every one of them\Nis a judo ace or idol...
0.5;And, as you all know, I'm Beika's\Ngreatest judo master and detective-
0.5;Yeah! I brought it\Nso we could all look at it!
0.5;Oh, this is from when we won\N2nd place at the city tournament!
0.5;Nakamichi and Yumi\Nwere an item back then, huh?
0.5;Yup. We cried together\Nback then, didn't we, Omura?
0.5;That's enough.\NYou're my husband now!
0.5;Don't be silly! I dumped\Nthis clod a long time ago!
0.5;And besides, he's already\Nchosen someone to marry...
0.5;You're getting married,\NNakamichi-kun?!
0.5;Yeah, well I had hoped to\Nformally announce it to you guys,
0.5;but the ceremony's going to\Nbe sometime this year!
0.5;I'll introduce her\Nto you guys sometime!
0.5;Conversely, the former Madonna\Nis still a single woman...
0.5;On top of that, I might lose my\Njob because of the bad economy...
0.5;Just kidding! I just wanted\Nto see how you would react!
0.5;But that means me and Omura-kun\Nare the only unmarried ones left.
0.5;Oh? Isn't this picture from when\Nwe came here five years ago?
0.5;We took this picture\Nin the ping-pong room!
0.5;Oh yeah! What do you say\Nwe play some ping-pong now?
0.5;But we're supposed to watch\Nthe fireworks in the evening!
0.5;Don't worry.\NThe fireworks start at 6:30.
0.5;If we end before 6:00,\Nwe'll make it in time.
0.5;I'm tired for some reason.\NI'll be resting in my room.
0.5;She does everything\Nat her own pace...
0.5;Anyway,\Nlet's play some ping-pong!
0.5;Hot springs and ping-pong\Ngo perfect together!
0.5;As a gym instructor, I can't\Nafford to lose to the lot of you!
0.5;Didn't you win an individual award\Nat a national championship before?
0.5;Yeah, only once,\Nwhen I was a junior in college.
0.5;No, there was a guy\Nwho was much better than me.
0.5;You had someone\Nthat good in your club?
0.5;You know him too, Ran-chan.\NHe's even staying at this inn.
0.5;What happened?\NThat was pretty fast...
0.5;Come on, how long are you\Ntwo going to play so stupidly like this?
0.5;Oh no! We have to hurry!\NThe place'll be crowded!
0.5;"I'll return the rackets and stuff;\Nyou go find us a spot."
0.5;Forget about her.\NIt's about to start!
0.5;Ugh. They really\Nshould've left her alone...
0.5;She gets real grouchy\Nwhenever somebody wakes her up.
0.5;What are you doing here,\NNakamichi-san?
0.5;I worked up a sweat playing\Nping-pong, so I took a quick bath.
0.5;I thought it was strange, since we're\Nthe only ones staying at this inn.
0.5;Oh, so you were\Nwashing off your sweat too?
0.5;Yup. But I was in\Nthe public bath unlike you.
0.5;But Ran-chan! It was definitely\Nbest that you didn't wake Yumi up!
0.5;She's really grouchy\Nwhen she wakes up!
0.5;She'll still be mad\Nwe didn't wake her up, though.
0.5;It sure is crowded!\NDon't let go of my hand, Conan-kun!
0.5;They got separated\Nfrom us in the crowd.
0.5;In that case,\NI'll look around for them.
0.5;He seems like a restless\Nkind of guy, huh?
0.5;Me and Omura went through\Nthe trouble to find a spot,
0.5;You guys do things\Nyour own way far too much!
0.5;She must be pouting because\Nshe missed the fireworks...
0.5;Looks like we\Nhave no other choice.
0.5;What do you say we all go and\Nwake up the judo club's Madonna?
0.5;There's nothing to fear if we wake\Nup the carefree woman together, eh?
0.5;Careful now,\Ndon't say that in front of Yumi!
0.5;Hey, are you still asleep?\NI'm turning the light on...
0.5;Nobody but me and Mori are to\Ncome in here, since we're detectives!
0.5;Ran-kun!\NCall the police immediately!
0.5;Hey! Isn't that the gun\Nthe bank robber had!
0.5;And the barrel looks like\Nit's been struck by something!
0.5;What's more,\NYumi was at the scene...
0.5;My company's right nearby.\NI came to have lunch.
0.5;Which means she had planned\Nto commit suicide at our reunion...
0.5;No, it's too early\Nto make any conclusions!
0.5;Let's wait until\Nthe police get here.
0.5;Why, Yumi?\NWhy did you have to die?!
0.5;What? Two hours\Nuntil the police get here?!
0.5;They said the streets are crowded\Nbecause of the festival today.
0.5;Damn it!\NWe can't wait two hours!
0.5;We have no choice!\NWe'll have to do the autopsy ourselves!
0.5;Who would've thought we\Nwould be giving Yumi an autopsy...
0.5;Her toes are beginning\Nto stiffen too...
0.5;Quite a bit of time\Nhas passed since she died...
0.5;What do you say we check\Nfor death spots as well?
0.5;But given the amount of blood\Nthat she's lost, she might not have any...
0.5;Hey, she's not wearing\Nanything underneath!
0.5;She was wearing a small one\Nwhen she was in the lobby.
0.5;And the index finger of the\Nhand that's holding the gun
0.5;You're always getting in\Nthe way of my investigations!
0.5;Judging from the state\Nof her rigor mortis,
0.5;That's when we were in the\Nping-pong room, after she left us.
0.5;Yeah. Most likely\Nshe returned to her room
0.5;and shot herself in the head\Nwith a gun she had hidden.
0.5;Then there's no question\Nit was a suicide...
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nshe did say something...
0.5;She really must've\Nbeen thinking about it!
0.5;Say, how did Yumi-san\Nshoot herself in the head?
0.5;Normally when someone\Ncommits suicide with a gun,
0.5;they stick the barrel\Nagainst their head, right?
0.5;Then her bullet wound\Nis missing something vital.
0.5;When you shoot a gun, a stream\Nof hot air accompanies the bullet!
0.5;If you shoot with\Nthe gun against your head,
0.5;The fact that there are\Nnone here means...
0.5;Someone shot her and then\Ntried to make it look like a suicide!
0.5;I saw the supposedly-dead Yumi\Nin a window upstairs!
0.5;I'm going to catch\Nwhoever killed her!
0.5;I've finally figured out\Nthe trick the killer used!
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut cases are even more so!
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;Ichikawa Kotaro may be president\Nof Ichikawa Industries now,
0.5;Grownups have grownup\Ncircumstances to take care of!
0.5;He hasn't had any work\Nat all for a long time now.
0.5;The president has a family\Nmeeting every year on his birthday.
0.5;This is Ichikawa,\Nthe head of the house.
0.5;Just so you know, I haven't\Ndecided to help you just yet.
0.5;You must take the great\NMori Kogoro for a cheap joke!
0.5;One, ten, hundred, thousand,\Nten thousand, hundred thousand--
0.5;My two daughters will be in\Nattendance at today's family meeting.
0.5;I want you to watch what\Nthey do and what they try to do.
0.5;No, it's fine. You can\Nexplain my condition to them.
0.5;So I'm thinking of retiring now,\Nbut I need to decide on a successor.
0.5;I have no intention of sharing\Nmy fortune with uncouth vultures,
0.5;Even so, inheritances are\Nsubject to legally-secured portions.
0.5;Your children would still get\Na percent of it, no matter what.
0.5;But not if there's an\Nissue with who it's going to.
0.5;Something's going to happen.\NSomething. I can feel it.
0.5;I've told everyone you're a friend,\Nand that you're with your family.
0.5;Be careful not to be\Nfound out as you do your work.
0.5;Mori-sama. Over there is\NKazue-san, the eldest daughter.
0.5;Yes, this is Mori-sama,\Na friend of your father's.
0.5;Isn't it a bother, being forced\Nto attend a gathering like this?
0.5;No, not at all!\NI came with my family...
0.5;You did act selfishly and leave\Nhome after you argued with him.
0.5;You got married right away because\Nyou were sick of seeing his face!
0.5;That reminds me, I hear\Nyour art gallery is being sued
0.5;for selling forgeries\Nor something like that!
0.5;"""Both daughters have\Nterrible personalities."""
0.5;A syringe! What is\Nshe planning to do?!
0.5;I thank you for gathering\Nhere on my birthday.
0.5;I intend to give up my position\Nas company president very soon.
0.5;Therefore, I've decided to sell\Nall my stock and ownership rights
0.5;you'll need to prove your\Nworth to the new administration.
0.5;I have no intention of\Ngiving any of you a single yen.
0.5;It was probably poison\Nshe put in the wine!
0.5;It's worth even more for\Na wine aficionado like yourself.
0.5;I'd feel bad for the wine if regular\Nknow-nothings like us drank it.
0.5;Oh, she's more\Nconsiderate than I thought!
0.5;Hey, I haven't seen\NConan-kun for a while.
0.5;This is an unnatural death for now.\NA police examiner is needed.
0.5;So, he collapsed immediately\Nafter drinking the wine?
0.5;He did have a weak heart,\Nbut one drink wouldn't have killed him!
0.5;Come again?! Are you\Nsuggesting I poisoned it?!
0.5;Dr. Okano knows\Nabout our father's condition!
0.5;but something so soon\Nand sudden is out of the question.
0.5;Now, now! I'm sorry to ask,\Nbut may we inspect your belongings?
0.5;Dr. Okano. Can you\Ntell what's in this vial?
0.5;What would happen if\Nthis was given to Mr. Ichikawa?
0.5;It's very dangerous\Neven for healthy individuals.
0.5;Given that he had\Na serious heart illness...
0.5;We'd still get our legally-secured portions,\Nno matter what he said.
0.5;Even if he said nothing,\Nwe'd still get a percentage of it.
0.5;and locked me up to\Nkeep me from getting in her way...
0.5;Oh, I think it might\Nbe the basement key.
0.5;How odd. He almost\Nnever went into the basement...
0.5;Was it the victim, Ichikawa-san,\Nwho threw me into the basement?!
0.5;If so, that means he knew the wine\Nwas poisoned when he drank it!
0.5;Was this to record\Nthe person who killed him?!
0.5;This smell... Ichikawa-san\Ndidn't drink the wine after all!
0.5;Then he pretended\Nto drink it and writhe in pain...
0.5;But there's no doubt\Nthat he really was poisoned.
0.5;Damn kid, scampering\Naround everywhere...
0.5;No one could've given him\Nthe poison in front of everyone else!
0.5;That's it! Only that\Nperson could've done it!
0.5;You damn kid,\Nsneaking into a place like this!
0.5;I'm a pathetic personal physician.\NI couldn't save him...
0.5;I've finally figured out\Nthe truth behind this incident,
0.5;"What do you mean\Nby ""the truth,"" Mori-kun?"
0.5;Indeed, I have no doubt that\NKazue-san poisoned the wine.
0.5;He pretended to drink, but dumped\Nit in the flowerpot by the window.
0.5;No. He died of a poison-induced\Nheart attack. I'm certain of it.
0.5;What kind of nonsense is this?!\NMy sister obviously killed him!
0.5;I guess he just couldn't\Naccept death normally,
0.5;even though he trusted you\Ntwo until the very last moment...
0.5;But didn't he hire you to investigate\Nbecause he didn't trust them?
0.5;He wanted to trust them.\NSo he tested them.
0.5;He probably planned to pretend to\Ncollapse from his heart illness
0.5;and then check later on the tape\Nto see how both daughters reacted.
0.5;when he learned Kazue-san\Nwas planning to kill him.
0.5;So that's when he decided to\Npretend to drink the poisoned wine.
0.5;Wait, hold on. Wasn't it\Npoison that caused his death?
0.5;Hold on now. I'm not sure\Nanyone had enough time to do that.
0.5;Yes. The killer openly gave him\Nthe poison while everyone watched.
0.5;You could've given him a shot\Nof poison instead of a heart stimulant.
0.5;You knew of Ichikawa-san's\Nplan, did you not?
0.5;he would've required his\Ndoctor's help to put on the act.
0.5;Otherwise, you would've\Nrealized he was faking right away.
0.5;Ichikawa-san confided\Nhis plan to you alone.
0.5;but you decided to use\Nit as a chance to murder him.
0.5;So no one would doubt his\Npersonal physician's diagnosis.
0.5;But why?! He has nothing\Nto do with the inheritance, right?!
0.5;there was no need to\Ndirty your own hands to kill him.
0.5;If you had told him his condition\Nwasn't serious, given how he was,
0.5;he would've kept pushing\Nhimself, hastening his death.
0.5;The fact you instead\Ntook direct action...
0.5;The president--no, Ichikawa\NKotaro--killed my father.
0.5;Ichikawa and my father were\Npartners when the business started.
0.5;The venture business they\Nstarted together was a great success.
0.5;But then he backstabbed\Nmy father and kicked him out
0.5;He would always utter\Ncomplaints to me, just a little kid.
0.5;But when he told me about his\Nplan to test his daughters' loyalty,
0.5;A horrible backstabber like him,\Ntesting the loyalty of others...
0.5;Your father said in his will\Nthat if something should happen to him,
0.5;"Listen. There's something\Ncalled a ""legally-secured portion."""
0.5;I hear you disposed of your\Nfather's stock certificates on your own.
0.5;I'm told the board of directors\Nis charging you with embezzlement.
0.5;don't even get one\Nyen of his inheritance...
0.5;H-Hey! What's gonna\Nhappen to this house?!
0.5;What do you mean?\NIt's going to be donated to someone.
0.5;And, just by chance yet again,\Nyou're here too, Mori-kun?!
0.5;P-Please don't shout, Inspector.\NMy hangover is killing me...
0.5;But the commentators said you have the \Nadvantage because you beat his attack.
0.5;And the Meijin seemed \Nunsure of his sealed move.
0.5;Wh-When I gave it to you, didn't I tell you \Nnot to open it until I got all seven?
0.5;Anyway, why'd you invite out this \Nbeautiful policewoman on her day off?
0.5;I'm about to get all seven, so I wanted \Nto make sure you had the envelope.
0.5;Propelled forward by the \Nyears spent together.
0.5;Charging full speed ahead \Nwithout slowing the pace.
0.5;A cowardly letter about a kidnapping leaves \Neveryone pondering the match and the case.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Taiko Meijin, Haneda Shukichi's \NMeijin title match.
0.5;Apparently the only title \Nhe's missing is Meijin.
0.5;Yeah. Once he regains the Meijin title \Ntoday, he'll have a Septuple Crown.
0.5;He'll be the second person \Nto achieve the feat.
0.5;Then the seven Yumi-san\Nmentioned before...
0.5;Since he'll have all seven, she'll \Nknow what's inside the envelope.
0.5;I was wondering if you \Nwanted to come hang out.
0.5;I'm not a Meijin, and the \Ngame is about to start.
0.5;But I was told to give this to you before \Nyou resumed playing on the second day.
0.5;He said you'd accept it once \Nyou saw who it was from.
0.5;Wh-Where are you going,\NSextuple Crown Haneda?
0.5;If you want to save her, you \Nmust decipher my game record.
0.5;The priest's daughter hiding in \Nthe well is kidnapped as well.
0.5;I used four hours and two minutes \Nin the final game of the first day.
0.5;Even with the hour I took for lunch, \NI still have less than six hours.
0.5;This should be the right place,\Nbut where is the well?
0.5;Isn't the match being held \Nat a hotel in Yamanashi?
0.5;Yes, so I took two hours so \NI could come here to pray.
0.5;See? Even if anyone's watching, \Nit'll just look like we're fans.
0.5;There's no way you'd come here \Non the day of your match,
0.5;Could you tell me why you really came here \Nwhile pretending to give me your autograph?
0.5;This shrine's best-known well is \NKiyomasa's Well dug by Kato Kiyomasa.
0.5;A TV star who was using a photo of the well \Nas her screen saver suddenly became popular,
0.5;and now it's known as a \Npower spot for good luck.
0.5;But doesn't Taiko refer \Nto Toyotomi Hideyoshi?
0.5;How do you not know that \Nwhen you're Taiko Meijin?
0.5;How do you know this text \Nindicates this shrine?
0.5;The priest's daughter hiding in \Nthe well is kidnapped as well.
0.5;The seven refers to the \Nseven major shogi titles.
0.5;and instructed him to \Ndecipher his game record.
0.5;Shogi was originally not about capturing your\Nopponent's king, but stealing his treasure.
0.5;The empty sanctuary means the \Nking or treasure has disappeared.
0.5;"the two that don't contain the character \Nfor ""king"" are Meijin and Kisei."
0.5;If it took two days for \Nthe treasure to disappear,
0.5;then it must be one of the \Nmatches played across two days:
0.5;the Meijin match, Ryuo match, \NOi match, or Osho match.
0.5;"The only title match without \N""king"" in its name,"
0.5;that's played across two \Ndays, is the Meijin match.
0.5;"In other words, a shrine whose name \Ncontains ""meijin,"" or Meiji Jingu."
0.5;Isn't that why you left your title \Nmatch to come here, Taiko Meijin?
0.5;Since the priest's daughter hiding \Nin the well was kidnapped,
0.5;I thought I could find a clue about \NYumi-san's abduction around the shrine's well.
0.5;The culprit said he'd wait \Nuntil your time ran out.
0.5;And Kiyomasa and Taiko both \Nloved festivals and shogi.
0.5;Maybe we'll gain something \Nfrom going together.
0.5;Though the real Taiko \Nwasn't as strong as you.
0.5;What? Sextuple Crown Haneda \Ntook a taxi to Tokyo?
0.5;I've tried calling his phone,\Nbut he won't answer.
0.5;An unspoken rule forbids him from \Nusing a cell phone during a match.
0.5;In our age, you can look up moves using \Ncell phones, which are small computers.
0.5;I don't know what happened, but he said \Nhe needed to think before he left.
0.5;He hasn't thrown in the towel against \NMeijin Katsumata Chikara yet.
0.5;take all seven titles, \Nand become a living god.
0.5;There's no waiting in shogi, \Nbut I've always made her wait.
0.5;Don't you understand that \NYumi-san's been kidnapped?
0.5;I'd just finished my ranking match \Nand was riding the Toto Loop Line.
0.5;The match left a bitter taste in my \Nmouth, and I was mentally exhausted.
0.5;Sorry. I feel asleep on the train \Nand missed it by five or six stops.
0.5;E-Even though your own stop passed, \Nyou waited for me to wake up.
0.5;But as a man of the impatient world \Nof shogi, her smile was so...
0.5;"It says ""second game"" on\Nthe bottom of the piece."
0.5;There's a weird diagram \Non the back of the piece.
0.5;Then this captured rook will break your \Nattack and shatter your formation.
0.5;First we need to decipher the meaning \Nof the numbers inside the circles.
0.5;Even if seven's the seven \Ntitles, what's three?
0.5;The only thing that comes to mind is \Nthe third-level professional league.
0.5;She's missed work two days in \Na row, she hasn't been home,
0.5;Yeah, we know. We're \Nlooking for her right now.
0.5;Yumi-san got really drunk a couple nights \Nago and took a taxi to a strange town.
0.5;so she called us from a pay phone \Nwith the change in her pocket.
0.5;So she's been wandering around \Nsomewhere for two days?
0.5;I know Yumi-san will find \Nsome way to contact us.
0.5;You should get a patrol car \Nready for when she does.
0.5;We need to figure out what \Nthe seven and three mean.
0.5;Apparently it's supposed \Nto help with easier births.
0.5;It's what they used to call \Nred light district workers.
0.5;And? Why were red light district \Nworkers called incense chariots?
0.5;P-Probably because it's \Nalso known as the lance.
0.5;It's like the spears or \Nlances you see in games.
0.5;Because the piece moves in a \Nstraight line any number of spaces.
0.5;It's in the middle of a slope \Nwith a terrifying name.
0.5;This move will fork his \Nking and silver general.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Taiko \NMeijin's Match of Love, Part Two!"""
0.5;You're jumping all over \Nthe place like a knight.
0.5;E-Excuse me, but could you \Nkeep your voices down,
0.5;It was their fault it nearly \Nturned into a murder.
0.5;When the countdown reaches zero, use your \Ndetective skills to produce an answer!

0.5;They seem to hate each other, \Nbut they're identical in every way.
0.5;Well, birds of a feather either \Nlove or hate each other.
0.5;After the president of a major \Ncompany died, his will disappeared.
0.5;Weekly magazines were full \Nof stories about the family
0.5;Two Nichiuri Sports reporters famous \Nfor their articles on scandals.
0.5;They even wrote scandalous articles \Nabout the arguing family members.
0.5;Ultimately, the family members clashed, \Nresulting in an attempted murder.
0.5;I heard they garnered a lot of \Ncriticism, and magazine sales fell.
0.5;He was a reporter for \NNichiuri Sports magazine.
0.5;but judging by the body's condition, \Nwe believe it was cyanide poisoning.
0.5;They're not the victim's, \Nand they're fairly fresh.
0.5;In other words, it's possible someone \Nelse was here around the time of death.
0.5;you're a reporter at \NNichiuri Sports, correct?
0.5;We just want to speak with you \Nas a material witness for now.
0.5;I'm sure my coworkers have \Nalready told you that.
0.5;You're sure Hashizume-san took \Nthe wrong travel mug, right?
0.5;and Kagazume-san drank \Nfrom it without knowing...
0.5;Yeah. It was yesterday \Nnight from 7 to 9, right?
0.5;and appearance of the deliveryman \Nwho arrived during that time.
0.5;We confirmed his story \Nwith the delivery company.
0.5;It would've been impossible for \NHashizume-san to make it to the crime scene.
0.5;watching that apartment \Nbuilding from 6PM to 7AM.
0.5;Conan-kun, did Mori-san really ask \Nyou to investigate this place?
0.5;The delivery Hashizume-san saw \Nhad a specified delivery time.
0.5;and the sender's name on \Nthe voucher was made up.
0.5;Later he checked the video \Nso he'd have an alibi.
0.5;We found the evidence to support \Nit in a surprising location.
0.5;"he meant to ""switch out travel mugs and \Nreturn poisoned mug to Hashizume."""
0.5;"Later, ""claim Hashizume was stressed \Nabout lack of progress at work,"
0.5;"and write obituary about the \Nloss of a rival and friend."""
0.5;You either accidentally took or \Nstole the victim's flash drive,
0.5;You learned of his plan to \Nkill you and became enraged,
0.5;and decided to murder him \Nusing the same method.
0.5;You pretended to accidentally \Ntake the victim's travel mug home
0.5;You invited the victim out \Nso you could return it
0.5;You made him think you reconciled \Nand made him drink it.
0.5;on the flash drive we \Nseized from Hashizume-san.
0.5;Both plans were written \Nat nearly the same time.
0.5;There are also no signs the \Ndocuments were unlocked and read.
0.5;Unbelievably enough, they \Ncoincidentally created the same plan
0.5;I fabricated an alibi, \Npoisoned the travel mug,
0.5;Hosoda-san was out gathering \Ninformation alone.
0.5;Kuwana-san was working late \Nin the office by herself.
0.5;We think some coffee spilled \Nfrom his mug when he collapsed.
0.5;We found the same cyanide in \Nit, so we're fairly certain.
0.5;Based on the length of his pants, \Nisn't it strange to only be on his socks?
0.5;He parked on the embankment \Nand walked here.
0.5;That you've uncovered the \Ntruth behind the case.
0.5;I came here because you said \Nyou found new evidence to—
0.5;Allow me to explain the \Ntruth behind the case.
0.5;First, Detective Takagi, what did \Nyou find in Kagazume-san's car?
0.5;On the floor of the driver's seat, \Nwe found traces of cyanide.
0.5;Kagazume-san put cyanide in \Nhis own mug inside his car.
0.5;And while doing that, he \Nspilled a bit of coffee.
0.5;Sitting in the driver's seat caused the hem \Nof his pants to ride up, exposing his socks.
0.5;Doesn't that mean they tried to \Nkill each other at the same time?
0.5;Kagazume-san meant to \Nmurder Hashizume-san
0.5;but he drank the coffee in the \Npoisoned mug he took first.
0.5;Kagazume-san drank from Hashizume-san's \Ntumbler he had initially.
0.5;As Hashizume-san claimed, they \Nnever exchanged mugs here.
0.5;so I'm not sure I left a print, \Nbut it could serve as evidence.
0.5;Kagazume-san drank from the \Nmug he poisoned himself.
0.5;At Mori-san's instructions, we found this on \Nanother one of Kagazume-san's flash drives.
0.5;It was never revealed publicly \Nin last year's case.
0.5;It describes the death of a \Nmajor company's president.
0.5;The disappearance of a will that \Nexacerbated an inheritance dispute.
0.5;How Hashizume-san and \NKagazume-san worked together then
0.5;they destroyed the will and \Nnever spoke of it again.
0.5;Kagazume-san suggested to Hashizume-san \Nthat they reveal the truth.
0.5;What we saw in the restaurant \Nwas part of that discussion.
0.5;Rejecting the idea and fearing \Nthe truth would come to light,
0.5;without realizing Kagazume-san \Nhad made his own plans
0.5;due to your similarities grew \Nover years of working together,
0.5;Kagazume-san realized you \Ndeliberately took his mug,
0.5;and realized you'd come \Nup with the same plan.
0.5;We found signs that some of \NKagazume-san's data had been erased,
0.5;After Hashizume-san's \Ndeath was ruled a suicide,
0.5;to make the remorseless \NHashizume-san suffer.
0.5;According to his physician, Kagazume-san was \Nsick and had not much time left to live.
0.5;he plotted to frame Hashizume-san \Nfor his own murder.
0.5;We did whatever it took to expose the \Nunsightly darkness within people!
0.5;I wish Kagazume-san had \Nbeen judged by the law,
0.5;for the attempted murder \Nof Kagazume-san
0.5;You must be tired. What \Ndo you want for dinner?
0.5;After beer, will I have \Nwine, cold sake, or shochu?
0.5;wine and sake have their \Nown uniqueness and flavor.
0.5;The sweater he was wearing was \Nfrom a pretty high-end brand.
0.5;If he was strapped for cash, \Nhe couldn't have bought that.
0.5;I thought I'd give you an \Naccurate version of the events.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan \Nis ""Result of the Draw!"""
0.5;She works at the florist in \Nthe shopping center, right?
0.5;I don't know where she's been since she \Ncame home from the florist three days ago.
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;passed out by a desperate man standing\Non a street corner searching for his wife!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;He was desperately looking \Nfor her in this rain.
0.5;It's only been three days \Nsince she went missing, right?
0.5;Maybe she'll return if \Nyou wait a little longer.
0.5;Are you sure you didn't \Ndo something to upset her?
0.5;Maybe you stood her up because you \Ngot caught up playing mahjong.
0.5;What? The Beika Center Building's \Nobservation tower and restaurant?
0.5;I'm surprised you got a reservation \Nat such a fancy restaurant.
0.5;She was genuinely excited since it wasn't \Nthe type of restaurant we could normally visit.
0.5;Besides, her phone and wallet \Nwere left in the living room.
0.5;But they couldn't say for \Ncertain if a crime took place.
0.5;I'm worried she was kidnapped \Nor got caught up in something.
0.5;That husband looks like he's going \Nto break before his wife is found.
0.5;all I can do is question her \Nworkplace and neighbors.
0.5;Tomomi-san went missing \Nthree days ago on Wednesday.
0.5;That's the day after the \Nphoto on the flyer was taken.
0.5;I think people will be more relaxed and \Nwilling to speak to you if I'm around.
0.5;Well, if you're going to beg, not even Mori \NKogoro is heartless enough to turn you away.
0.5;Let's start by questioning \Nhis next door neighbor.
0.5;She seemed happy and said she'd be having \Ndinner at a restaurant that night.
0.5;Did you see any suspicious people \Nor vehicles around here that day?
0.5;Does that mean you didn't hear \Nany suspicious sounds either?
0.5;Besides, if that kind of sound were made in \Na residential neighborhood like this one,
0.5;I don't interact much with the \Npeople who live around here.
0.5;All we learned is that she was looking \Nforward to eating at the restaurant.
0.5;Let's try asking around behind \NHiguchi-san's house next.
0.5;I didn't see her that day, but last \Nweek I saw her by the Teimuzu River.
0.5;It seemed like she was arguing with \Nher husband, so I didn't speak to her.
0.5;"She was saying ominous things like ""let \Nme live tonight"" and ""kill me tomorrow."""
0.5;on Sunday in the park next \Nto Higuchi-san's house.
0.5;I'm sorry. That's actually \Nwhat she was screaming.
0.5;so I thought you came to investigate \NTomomi's disappearance.
0.5;This officer is saying I murdered Tomomi \Nand buried her body in the yard!
0.5;We found something, \NDetective Takagi. A woman's body.
0.5;I understand how you feel, but \Nplease stay away from the body.
0.5;The victim is Higuchi Tomomi-san, \Ntwenty-nine years old.
0.5;with these pruning shears \Nburied along with the body.
0.5;That man over there is the victim's \Nhusband Higuchi Masaki-san.
0.5;we've had several of the neighbors \Ncome to serve as witnesses.
0.5;According to your neighbors, you and \Nyour wife had a terrible relationship.
0.5;They said you fought about \Nwhether or not you'd kill her.
0.5;But over the course of making inquiries, \NI became certain you did it.
0.5;Hey, didn't you just say you were \Nfooled by Higuchi-san's acting?
0.5;Yes, but it wasn't me who \Nwas fooled by his acting.
0.5;These people are the neighbors who testified \Nthat Higuchi-san argued with Tomomi-san.
0.5;All three of them clearly remembered \Nwhat they argued about.
0.5;"After all, she was screaming ""let me \Nlive tonight"" and ""kill me tomorrow."""
0.5;"I heard her screaming ""forgive me"" and \N""don't kill me"" in the middle of the night."
0.5;"When I heard them arguing, she \Nwas screaming, ""send me away."""
0.5;"They're lines spoken by Desdemona \Nin Shakespeare's ""Othello."""
0.5;It was the first time she'd \Nbeen given a big role.
0.5;So you went to the riverside \Nand park to rehearse together.
0.5;But doesn't that make \Nthings a little strange?
0.5;Sakie-san's testimony, which claimed \Nshe heard you rehearsing at night...
0.5;Because you're the true culprit \Nwho murdered Tomomi-san
0.5;This photo was taken the day \Nbefore Tomomi-san went missing.
0.5;See how the branches are currently \Nshorter than they are in the photo?
0.5;using the pruning shears \Nused as the murder weapon.
0.5;she said she wanted to cut them because \Nthey cast a shadow on her kitchen garden.
0.5;Neighborhood disputes over whether or not \Nto cut branches can become quite serious.
0.5;It's not unusual for them \Nto turn into lawsuits.
0.5;but Tomomi-san cut the olive \Nbranches without realizing that.
0.5;Sakie-san, you became furious and stabbed \NTomomi-san with those pruning shears.
0.5;it's hard to imagine that you \Ngardened on a regular basis.
0.5;you didn't go to the trouble of \Nusing the gate to enter the yard.
0.5;In other words, you climbed \Nover that rose bush.
0.5;When I looked at the bushes earlier, there \Nwas just one area unnaturally devoid of roses.
0.5;Takagi-kun, doesn't the photo on \Nthe flyer show roses in this spot?
0.5;Huh? There's something that looks \Nlike blood on these thorns.
0.5;If examined, I'm sure it \Nwill match your blood.
0.5;Will you tell us why you climbed over \Nthe bushes to enter another home's yard?
0.5;There was blood other than \Nthe victim's on the weapon.
0.5;You can wipe away fingerprints, \Nbut the blood remains.
0.5;Definitely. She wouldn't have been \Nexposed if she hadn't reported it.
0.5;She probably thought she could frame Higuchi \Nsince we were questioning the neighborhood.
0.5;I was sick and tired you seeing you happily \Nfiddle with your garden day after day!
0.5;And ultimately, you even ended up \Nmessing with another person's tree!
0.5;Your branches are growing into our \Nyard, so I thought I would cut—
0.5;In any case, we'll hear what you have \Nto say once we return to the station.

0.5;Hello, this is\NAsano Aki from Nichiuri TV.
0.5;I'm calling because I need to\Nspeak with you about something urgent.
0.5;You appear to be out,\Nso I'll call again later.
0.5;The weather lady! You know,\Nshe does the weather on Nichiuri TV!
0.5;But what could she urgently\Nneed to talk to him about?
0.5;Alright! Let's talk with her instead,\Nas the Junior Detective League!
0.5;Yes! If you need help, leave it\Nto us, the Junior Detective League!
0.5;Oh, are you\Ngreeting children today?
0.5;Behave yourselves, kiddies.\NDon't get in the way of her work.
0.5;Isn't she the person who\Ndid the news before you did?
0.5;That's right. We switched\Nplaces about half a year ago.
0.5;Was she what you wanted\Nto talk to Mr. Mori about?
0.5;I was wondering if Detective\NMori-san would be on News City!
0.5;Ran-neechan told me to take it\Nbecause I always suddenly disappear.
0.5;Oh, this is the detective agency's number,\Nso it must be Ran-neechan!
0.5;Oh, I know! Could you give\Nme your pager's number?
0.5;I can contact you when I need\Nthe Junior Detective League's help!
0.5;"Let's see... Now to save\N""Junior Detective League"" to my phone..."
0.5;Oh! This only shows numbers, huh?\NI used to have one, too!
0.5;you can use numbers that look\Nand sound like letters to write things!
0.5;Say, since you're here, how about\Na tour of the News City studio?
0.5;Yes. Yes. I will. Yes.\NOkay. I'll be right there.
0.5;I'm sorry to ask, but could\Nyou show them to Studio A?
0.5;Oh, and could you\Nget them some passes?
0.5;Sorry to suddenly\Nask you to stand in like this!
0.5;That's fine, but what's this\Nabout Aki-san being threatened?
0.5;Who are these kids?!\NThey're distracting! Get rid of them!
0.5;Running off because of a threat?!\NAki-san is a failure as a journalist!
0.5;We came to see Aki-san \Nin Detective Mori's place!
0.5;ever since she started a story\Nabout a certain politician's corruption.
0.5;She got a letter this\Nmorning threatening to kill her
0.5;Was this threat what\Nshe really wanted to discuss?
0.5;You can see the News City\Nbroadcast on that TV.
0.5;Hey, do you think the\Nphone call Aki-san got earlier
0.5;When she was on the phone then,\Nshe didn't seem afraid at all.
0.5;In fact, she sounded happy,\Nas if she had gotten a special scoop.
0.5;No, wait! If that call had been\Na trap to lure her somewhere--!
0.5;It's probably Aki-san. Only she\Nand Ran-neechan know this number.
0.5;Hello, this is Asano. I'm not home\Nright now, so please leave your--
0.5;It was her home. But it\Nwas her answering machine.
0.5;That's odd! Why would she have\Nyou call her home if she isn't there?
0.5;A bad guy must've caught her!\NSo she wants us to call the police!
0.5;Then couldn't she\Njust call them herself?
0.5;If the police can't help,\Nthen the Junior Detective League will!
0.5;Yeah, but this isn't\Nenough to know where she is.
0.5;The J-League game at the\NNational Stadium between the Tokyo--
0.5;"I got it! It's read ""Niousama""!\N[temple guardian]"
0.5;So she's where there\Nare temple guardian statues!
0.5;Come on. Can't you deduce\Na little better than that?
0.5;The messages after\N7:20 make no sense at all.
0.5;The Special Investig. Unit of\Nthe Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office
0.5;is to question the politicians\NMr. Maruya and Mr. Okubo tomorrow
0.5;about their possible\Nacceptance of large bribes
0.5;in relation to the corruption\Ncase involving Bay Development.
0.5;I've figured out what\NAki-san's messages mean!
0.5;These are indicating the names\Nof the politicians who took bribes!
0.5;So Aki-san is trying to say\Nit's Maruya who's guilty of corruption!
0.5;They're bank account numbers\Nused for the bribes, of course!
0.5;Alright! Aki-san must be\Ncaptured at Maruya's home then!
0.5;I heard he lives in West Teitan,\None subway stop from here!
0.5;I paged you and paged you,\Nbut you ignored me!
0.5;It's nice weather here.\NThe moon is really pretty!
0.5;It's pouring here, so I don't\Nthink I'll be home for a while.
0.5;Should I bring an\Numbrella and come get you?
0.5;A cold front in the northern Kanto\Nregion will bring clouds and rain.
0.5;"Now, the reason Aki-san\Nsent this ""2003"" message first"
0.5;was because she wanted\Nus to look up at the night sky.
0.5;As I recall, the moon\Nwas in the southeast then.
0.5;But it wasn't visible\Nfrom Maruya's mansion,
0.5;Which means Aki-san\Nisn't at Maruya's home, right?!
0.5;Right... she's being held somewhere\Nwhere she can see the moon.
0.5;But that isn't enough to\Ntell us where she is.
0.5;to indicate weather\Nchanges where she is!
0.5;00 is the double-circle\Nmeaning cloudy weather.
0.5;It's just as you thought!\NAki-san is somewhere in this area!
0.5;"Wouldn't 01 be the symbol\Nfor ""clear weather""?!"
0.5;No, it's still cloudy here.\NIt must mean something different.
0.5;"I bet 0109 means, ""I want\Nto eat a huge eel box lunch!"""
0.5;What's your problem?!\NIt's not that funny!
0.5;Sorry, sorry! That's not it!\NNice work, Genta!
0.5;Yeah! That's where\Nwe got separated from her!
0.5;As I recall, it's the northernmost\Nroom on the first floor...
0.5;Like Genta said, you read the 0,\N10, and 9 of that 0109 separately!
0.5;0, 10, 9? O... to... ku?\NOdogu! (large prop)
0.5;There are lots of rooms in\NTV stations that people rarely enter!
0.5;If the kidnapper works here,\Nthey could use one!
0.5;You called Aki-san here,\Nknocked her out with drugs or something,
0.5;to make others think she had run away,\Nout of fear of that threat.
0.5;Yes, you tried to ruin her credibility\Nand have her kicked off News City!
0.5;Aki-san used her cell phone to\Nsend us messages about her location
0.5;Except, there was one message\Nshe sent that I didn't understand.
0.5;This number came in after\Na message to call the police.
0.5;9109 is separated as 9-10-9.\NChanged to kanji and read aloud...
0.5;That would be you,\NTsukumo Kazumi-san!
0.5;News City was my idea!\NIt was my show from the start!
0.5;However you rationalize it,\Na crime can't be justified.
0.5;But only the Junior Detective\NLeague could've realized
0.5;When she tried to put me to sleep,\NI caught a glimpse of her nails.
0.5;Yep! The design reminded me of\Na weather map, so I remembered it.
0.5;That means you're\Nsnow pellets, Genta-kun!
0.5;He's the one who ordered me to kill \Nmy beloved wife with my own hands!
0.5;With the same feelings we've \Nalways held still in our hearts,
0.5;The partner and puppet of a master \Nventriloquist moves on its own?
0.5;It's just a doll, but that \Nwas scary, wasn't it?
0.5;Just before the curtains went up, \Nhe said he was changing the program.
0.5;If you can't do it, \NI'll do it for you, Partner.
0.5;Since he's under the effect of sedatives, \Nthe doctors want him to stay here tonight.
0.5;Apparently, Tengan-san has regained \Nconsciousness and is asking to see you.
0.5;I hope you'll forgive my \Ndisgraceful display, Mori-san.
0.5;They suspect that I have dissociative \Nidentity disorder or a split personality.
0.5;You've always been shy and unable \Nto speak your true feelings.
0.5;No, if I'd never encountered \Nventriloquism, my life would be...
0.5;The truth is I may kill my\Nown wife at his urging.
0.5;When I'm home alone, I can hear him even \Nthough I'm not practicing ventriloquism.
0.5;I can only imagine his \Nvoice comes from inside me.
0.5;That woman is having an \Naffair with your apprentice!
0.5;If they love each other,\NI'm willing to get a divorce.
0.5;I don't know if I'm playing the doll, \Nor if he's speaking from inside of me.
0.5;I'm afraid of what I'll do \Nif I lose consciousness.
0.5;Like my performance program, \Nsomeday I might...
0.5;I understand. So that's \Nwhy you wanted to hire me.
0.5;Consulting with the medical specialists \Nhere would be a more sensible choice.
0.5;What? I thought you were \Nstaying here tonight.
0.5;Togawa Haruomi-san, \Nwho came to pick you up for work,
0.5;Last night when you returned from the \Nhospital, was your wife still out of the house?
0.5;Yes. Lately she's been \Ngoing out at night a lot.
0.5;When that cheater died,\N my partner was snoring in bed.
0.5;Hey, you're saying that after \NI backed up your alibi?
0.5;You're the one who actually \Ndid the deed, Partner.
0.5;Anyway, does he really have \Ndissociative identity disorder?
0.5;Maybe he's trying to make us think that so \Nhe won't be found criminally responsible,
0.5;I, the great detective Mori Kogoro, will \Ndetermine the truth behind this case.
0.5;Only Tengan-san's fingerprints \Nwere on the weapon, right?
0.5;Based on their position, he grabbed the trophy \Nthat was sitting here, raised it over his head,
0.5;and brought it down on the \Nback of the victim's head,
0.5;who was sitting on the \Ncouch and drinking sake.
0.5;There must be a recorder somewhere \Nsending sounds to them.
0.5;We found your fingerprints on \Nthis recorder and these speakers.
0.5;They were set up in the living \Nroom of Tengan-san's apartment.
0.5;Togawa-san, you're trying \Ntoo hard to feign ignorance.
0.5;During your voluntary appearance and search \Nat the station, we found this inside your bag.
0.5;Do you know what this \Nis that's stuck to here?
0.5;Yes. The DNA test indicated \Nthat it's the victim's blood.
0.5;Togawa-san, where were you \Naround 2 AM this morning?
0.5;My master said he'd check my\Nprogress first thing in the morning,
0.5;This is the spare key to Tengan-san's \Napartment that you were holding onto.
0.5;But as his apprentice and \Nattendant, I need it.
0.5;and you could freely enter and \Nleave the scene of the crime.
0.5;By the way, I heard you and the \Nvictim had a special relationship.
0.5;I-It's true that something\Nhappened between us.
0.5;My master scolded me every day for my \Ninexperience, and she was kind to me.
0.5;And she felt lonely because \Nhe was always so busy.
0.5;You became anxious for your future as a \Nventriloquist and thought she was in the way.
0.5;You made Tengan-san believe he\Nhad dissociative identity disorder,
0.5;He's one tough nut to keep denying \Nit in the face of all that evidence.
0.5;But we've already requested \Nan arrest warrant.
0.5;I nearly arrested the wrong \Nman. Thanks for the help.
0.5;I apologize for the trouble and concern I \Ncaused to all concerned parties and my fans.
0.5;You're a victim of infidelity and \Nbereaved husband of a murder victim.
0.5;I'm surprised the serious looking \NTogawa-san did it, though.
0.5;The same goes for his \Nrelationship with the victim.
0.5;All thanks to me, the Sleeping Kogoro, also \Nknown as the great detective Mori Kogoro.
0.5;Don't drink too much, and make \Nsure you come home early.
0.5;Would someone trying to put the blame \Non Tengan-san ask the old man for help?
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “The \NVentriloquist's Illusion, Part Two!”
0.5;That hits so close to \Nhome, it's not even funny.
0.5;The person who vanished after killing \NHaneda Koji seventeen years ago...
0.5;...is the number two man of the \NBlack Organization, Rum.
0.5;Even if that's the dying message \Nhe left before he was murdered,
0.5;Is Asaka their family name \Nor given name, anyway?
0.5;If it's their family name, then \NI can't even tell their gender.
0.5;Besides, Gin mentioned something \Nwhen I was given that drug.
0.5;This drug was recently developed \Nby the Organization.
0.5;They won't be able to find any \Ntraces of poison in the body.
0.5;Although this prototype hasn't \Nbeen tested on humans yet.
0.5;Which means I was given the \Nthe drug recreated by Haibara,
0.5;Yeah, I remember a shady detective \Nwho used to go by that name.
0.5;In any case, I need to \Ngather more information.
0.5;But the case's site was taken down, and \Nit hasn't been reuploaded for a while.
0.5;What? He's going to solve the \Nmystery of Haneda Koji's murder?
0.5;...who was murdered in America \Nseventeen years ago?
0.5;He's going to summon the \Nspirit of Haneda Koji?!
0.5;This time it's just a short segment\Non a late night TV show,
0.5;but if it's well-received, it'll \Nbe switched to prime time?
0.5;There's a planning meeting tomorrow \Nmorning at a hotel restaurant?
0.5;Even heaven is watching the \Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills \Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;...with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Ran-neechan's been gone since yesterday \Nnight because of her karate training camp.
0.5;And it's not fair that you're the \Nonly one who gets to eat at a hotel.
0.5;Besides, I want to meet \Nthe spirit detective, too.
0.5;That detective Hotta \NGaito summons the spirits...
0.5;...of dead people and says \Nthings only people close...
0.5;Besides, Hotta knew all that information \Nbecause he investigated cases beforehand.
0.5;It got out that he paid people to create \Nfalse witness reports of the missing person.
0.5;After the media destroyed \Nhim, he disappeared.
0.5;Anyway, I'm surprised he \Nwas able to return to TV.
0.5;If he's summoning the spirit \Nof a man who died so long ago,
0.5;it's likely he got a hold of information related \Nto the case that hasn't been made public yet.
0.5;I'll do whatever it takes \Nto get that information.
0.5;You think we could get a \Ncomment from you, too?
0.5;First, we need to go the room \Nwhere Hotta-san is staying.
0.5;Apparently he wants you to \Nsee him summon a spirit.
0.5;Anyway, you were right to \Nbring Conan-kun with you.
0.5;Even if him summoning a spirit \Ndoes seem a little fake,
0.5;we'll still be able to get a \Nshot of him looking surprised.
0.5;I can't imagine this kid \Nbeing surprised by that.
0.5;When I emailed him this morning to \Nconfirm the time of our meeting,
0.5;he said he was seeing someone \Nelse before our meeting.
0.5;I-In any case, I'll have a \Nbellhop come unlock the door.
0.5;Sorry. It took a while \Nto explain the situation.
0.5;You don't need to bother \Nwith that. Open the door.
0.5;Looks like someone was drinking \Nwine until a moment ago.
0.5;That person dropped the plates and \Nglasses in surprise when we came in,
0.5;stepped in the spilled wine, \Nand ran into that room.
0.5;They must've crossed the balcony \Ninto the room next door.
0.5;Is there someone staying \Nin the room next door?
0.5;A young high school-aged man has \Nbeen staying there since last week.
0.5;Some kid has been living by \Nthemselves in a hotel for a week?
0.5;Since it's loud and makes \Nthe rooms shake a little,
0.5;But judging by the fact that \Nhe hasn't moved an inch,
0.5;I'll go back to the front \Ndesk and call the police.
0.5;That kid living in the room next \Ndoor may have been killed already.
0.5;Huh? You're the guy from \Nthe detective agency.
0.5;When you ran into the room, you saw footprints \Nleft by someone who stepped in the wine.
0.5;Those footprints led into the bedroom, so \Nwhen you opened the door and went inside,
0.5;the window was open, and you saw \Nsomeone running from the balcony.
0.5;That balcony is connected to the \Nbalcony of my room, room 403.
0.5;you noticed a slight lump \Nin the bed in the bedroom.
0.5;That's why we were wondering if \Nanyone suspicious came to your room.
0.5;But the wine-stained slippers were left at the \Nedge of the balcony of the room next door.
0.5;your room was the only \Nplace they could've gone.
0.5;They could have sneaked in \Nand be hiding somewhere.
0.5;Apparently he met someone \Nbefore he was meeting me.
0.5;It's probably someone involved \Nin that seventeen year old case.
0.5;Hotta Gaito said he was going to \Nsummon the spirit of Haneda Koji,
0.5;Did that detective tell you \Nanything about the case?
0.5;Y-Yeah. He was a professional \Nshogi player, right?
0.5;If you want to be involved in this \Ncase, let me search your room.
0.5;The police will be doing it \Nanyway when they get here.
0.5;How long does it take to \Nput away some underwear?
0.5;We received a complaint about a car parked \Nin a strange spot in the parking lot.
0.5;Anyway, since the wine-stained slippers \Nwere on the balcony next door,
0.5;Huh? There's a car parked \Ndirectly below the balcony.
0.5;More importantly, solve this \Ncase as soon as possible.
0.5;If the police search this room, \Nthey'll find out about me.
0.5;You need to solve it before \Nthey hear about the information...
0.5;...concerning Haneda Koji's \Nmurder and come here.
0.5;I understand the events leading \Nup to the discovery of the body.
0.5;But it's hard to believe someone \Nhurried out of the room,
0.5;since you heard the sounds of wine glasses \Nand plates breaking when you opened the door.
0.5;There was construction taking place \Non the floor below at that time.
0.5;You entered this room right \Naround 9 AM, didn't you?
0.5;Then couldn't the vibrations from the \Nwork have caused the glasses and plates...
0.5;Why don't we try it by putting our \Nphones on the edge of the table?
0.5;Half of them fell, but the other \Nhalf are still on the table.
0.5;Even if the table shakes, there's no telling \Nwhich way they'll shift, so they don't all fall.
0.5;the odds that they would fall \Non the floor were 50-50.
0.5;And there's no guarantee construction \Nwould start at exactly 9 AM.
0.5;Actually, construction was \Nscheduled to start at 9 AM.
0.5;It's falling behind schedule, so the hotel has \Nbeen pressuring the construction company to hurry.
0.5;But there's still no guarantee \Nit would start at exactly 9 AM.
0.5;Actually, we once received \Na complaint from a guest...
0.5;so the construction crew's clocks are set \Nto match the hotel's down to the second.
0.5;But it's still a coincidence that \Nwe opened the door at exactly 9 AM.
0.5;Besides, we opened the door \Nthen because Kokuri-san...
0.5;Sorry. It took a while \Nto explain the situation.
0.5;I-In any case, I'll have a \Nbellhop come unlock the door.
0.5;And the email Kokuri-san \Nnoticed was sent an hour ago.
0.5;So the killer fled from the room when they \Nnoticed us enter and dropped the utensils then.
0.5;Something got stuck to my hand \Nwhen I hit the table earlier.
0.5;If they used salt, then that explains \Nwhat the inspector said earlier.
0.5;And all the coincidences \Nthe old man listed...
0.5;You got salt on the base \Nof your pinkie finger...
0.5;...when you hit the table directly above \Nwhere the glasses and plates had fallen.
0.5;I'm the type of person who organizes their \Nthoughts by asking themselves questions.
0.5;Mori-kun, are you sure you saw \Nsomeone run from that window?
0.5;So you found signs something \Nwas stuck above the window.

0.5;I heard some high school students \Nsolved the murder case.
0.5;Yeah, that's the one. I heard there \Nwas another boy and girl, too.

0.5;Come to think of it,\Nshe wasn't at school today.
0.5;We actually don't know why \Nshe didn't come to school.
0.5;so I haven't been able to \Nget in touch with them.
0.5;I'm worried about her, so could you go \Nto Maria-chan's house and check on her?
0.5;I'll head there as soon \Nas I finish up my work.
0.5;Wasn't she looking forward to \Nhaving curry for lunch today?
0.5;she said she found a letter \Nfrom her dead grandma
0.5;It sounds like Grandma set up a \Ntreasure hunt in her house for me.
0.5;Do you guys want to invite Conan-kun \Nand look for it together sometime?
0.5;Then it's likely she went \Nto look for the treasure.
0.5;Yeah. She said it was across the \Nstreet, so that's probably it.

0.5;This reminds me of the arrow code \Nthe professor hid in that mansion.

0.5;Oh, right. It fell during \Nthis afternoon's earthquake.

0.5;He must've thought it would \Nbe dangerous to take a car.
0.5;The police can't come for a \Nwhile because of the snow.

0.5;The mountain side is piled high, but \Nthe snow is low on the cliff side.
0.5;The snow piles high on the \Nshady side of the mountain.
0.5;Why did Masahiko-san put himself in \Ndanger by taking the steep side road?
0.5;You can't take a car down that road, \Nbut it's a faster way into town.
0.5;Because I forgot my medicine, \NMasahiko-san is...
0.5;I actually discovered the \Ntruth behind this case.
0.5;The culprit made Masahiko-san fall to his \Ndeath with a trap in this planned homicide.
0.5;W-Wait a minute! There were no signs \Nof a trap at the scene of the crime!
0.5;And we stayed together \Nafter Masahiko-san left.
0.5;No one had the opportunity \Nto dispose of the trap.
0.5;First the culprit pushed the snow on \Nthe side road towards the mountain.
0.5;Then Masahiko-san would avoid the mountain \Nside and pass next to the cliff.
0.5;and placed a sheet of ice they \Nfroze in the freezer there.
0.5;I see. Ice is easily hidden in the\Nsnow and eventually melts.
0.5;That's a package of Monaka Ice \Nthat just went on sale yesterday!
0.5;That's right. And these are \Npieces of the ice cream bar.
0.5;Genta secretly took it from \Nthe boarding house's freezer.
0.5;She smelled garlic even though \Nthere were no garlic dishes
0.5;the culprit was freezing a pan of water \Nin the freezer to create a sheet of ice.
0.5;Genta-kun's crumbs mixed into \Nthe sheet and froze into it.
0.5;The culprit used the sheet without \Nrealizing the pieces were there.
0.5;There's no other reason pieces of the \NMonaka bar would be at the crime scene.
0.5;Yes, the culprit must be one of \Nthis boarding house's residents.
0.5;We did witness Aya-san \Nreturning from the side road.
0.5;She returned with nothing in \Nher hands and her guard down.
0.5;In order to set the trap, \Nshe would need a cooler
0.5;to transport the sheet of ice \Nand a shovel to move the snow.
0.5;Besides, the culprit wouldn't \Nhave called out to us.
0.5;Most likely Aya-san simply saw the true \Nculprit returning from the side road.
0.5;Though she inspected the \Nside road out of curiosity,
0.5;she probably didn't notice \Nthe trap that was set.
0.5;If she had, she probably would \Nhave stopped the culprit.
0.5;I had to exterminate the \Nevil insect clinging to you.

0.5;Office worker Oide Raita-san, 58 years \Nold, was at his home in Tebai City.
0.5;and about 300 thousand \Nyen in cash was stolen.

0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;And the other day, my \Nolder sister got engaged.
0.5;Her partner is the son of a \Nlocally famous wealthy family.
0.5;My old friends caught wind of it \Nand tried to extort her partner.
0.5;The morning of the incident, my mom and \Nsister were planning to go out together,

0.5;Do you have any idea how \Nimportant this time is?
0.5;Why don't you show a little more \Nconsideration for your family?
0.5;We got into a bit of an argument, but \NI brushed him off and fled the house.
0.5;I heard what happened next \Nfrom my sister and mom.
0.5;Apparently he called my \Nsister from the house.
0.5;when they returned home after \Ngiving up the search for me.
0.5;Normally my dad wouldn't be \Nat home during the evening.
0.5;If I hadn't run away, the thief \Nwouldn't have entered the house.
0.5;On top of that, I've caused \Ntrouble for my sister.

0.5;All the scheduling and arrangements \Nfor her wedding have been postponed.
0.5;That's my sister and mom \Nhanding out fliers over there.
0.5;a silent call was made to the Oide \Nresidence from a nearby public telephone.
0.5;We're looking into everyone with break-ins \Nvia lockpicking on their record, but...
0.5;Would someone who picks locks \Nto secretly enter empty homes
0.5;They probably did it spur of the moment \Nwhen they ran into the homeowner.
0.5;Yeah, but it's also odd that someone \Ntrying to rob an empty house
0.5;My mom's going to be staying at the \Nhospital for two or three days.
0.5;You mentioned something \Nabout the gears of tragedy.
0.5;This door looks strangely \Nnew compared to the wall.
0.5;Lockpicking requires skill, but it's easy \Nto break in when you have a spare key.
0.5;So it was Taira Yasushi-san who was \Nresponsible for replacing the door.
0.5;And he was out on a job ten days \Nago last Wednesday evening?
0.5;I have a few questions \Nfor you about the robbery
0.5;I think you should tell us everything \Nyou know instead of running.
0.5;to pay off four month's \Nworth of rent, didn't you?
0.5;You secretly made a spare key \Nwhen you replaced the door,
0.5;and used that to sneak \Ninto the Oide residence.
0.5;The scratches on the front door keyhole \Nwere a camouflage, weren't they?
0.5;You did it to make it look like \Nthe front door had been picked
0.5;I'll tell you everything I know \Nif you'll prove my innocence.
0.5;I needed the money, so I broke \Ninto that house that day.
0.5;and snuck in through the back \Ndoor using the spare key I made.
0.5;So Raita didn't answer the phone \Nbecause he was fast asleep.
0.5;Yeah, but I thought it'd be fine \Nas long as I didn't wake him up.
0.5;I quietly stole the cash, scratched \Nup the front door keyhole,
0.5;Please be careful as you \Nreturn to your homes.
0.5;Oide Raita-san's estimated time \Nof death is also after 4:30.
0.5;In other words, this case \Nisn't a robbery and murder.
0.5;It's two separate cases: \Na burglary and a murder.
0.5;Yeah, but do you really think a murderer \Nentered his home right after a burglar?
0.5;We'll hold him at our \Nstation as a key witness.
0.5;If we let the police handle it, \Nhe just might confess to it.
0.5;Mori-san, do you really \Nbelieve he's a murderer?
0.5;If the culprit is someone else, \Nthe police won't find him.
0.5;If there's a true culprit who cleverly \Nbeat the police investigation,
0.5;then finding them would \Nbe a job for Mori Kogoro.
0.5;Generally speaking, the motive \Nis likely to be a grudge.
0.5;Honestly, I doubt Taira \Nis the culprit either.
0.5;Can you think of anyone who \Nmay have resented Raita?
0.5;He was careful in his relationships \Nwith people. Right?
0.5;Yeah. He was reluctant to get \Non board with my engagement.
0.5;He was convinced marrying \Ninto a wealthy family
0.5;would make maintaining \Nrelationships difficult.
0.5;He smiled and said he had \Nbeen worried about nothing.
0.5;The two of you were looking \Nfor Fusaya-san together
0.5;This will finally stop the gears of tragedy \Nthat have been turning for our family.
0.5;then I should move ahead with \Nthe wedding planning soon.
0.5;Anyway, you weren't lying when you said \Nthe famous Mori-san accepted the case.
0.5;Only those three knew Oide \NRaita-san was at home.
0.5;And while he expressed his disapproval \Nof his daughter's engagement,
0.5;only his wife knew that issue \Nhad already been resolved.
0.5;Also, the sister and mom were acting \Nseparately when Raita-san was killed.
0.5;The mother secretly returned home \Nto help her daughter get engaged,
0.5;but Raita continued to \Ndisapprove of the idea, and...
0.5;So she's definitely in a \Nweakened state due to anxiety.
0.5;Is it possible she's living \Nan unhealthy life on purpose?
0.5;Mori-san, despite your stature, I can't tell \Nyou the details of a patient's condition.
0.5;It's possible her fear of being \Nsuspected caused her anxiety.
0.5;I guess we'll get dinner \Nand go home for today.
0.5;The gears of tragedy that began \Nturning for the Oide family.
0.5;Why was Oide Raita, who was home \Nthat day by chance, murdered?
0.5;was due to the sleeping pills \Nhe was given taking effect.
0.5;on the day of the incident \Nwhen the 4:30PM notice played.
0.5;Dad was really angry while \Nhe was fixing the shelf.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Automatic Tragedy, Part Two!"""
0.5;The Detective Boys met a woman \Nnamed Midorikawa Saki-san.
0.5;She helped Ayumi-chan when \Nshe tripped and hurt herself.
0.5;We thought Saki-san was a \Nkind, good-natured person,
0.5;but shortly afterwards, we \Nnoticed something strange:
0.5;Women's university professor \NTachibana Junnosuke-san.
0.5;Dojima-sensei, did you find \Nwhat you were looking for?
0.5;What are the three mysteries \Nconnected to her window?
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;“The Woman Standing in \Nthe Window, Part Two!”
0.5;Ma'am, you were at the \Nintersection yesterday, right?
0.5;It would've been natural for \Nher to report it to the police.
0.5;I told you, I was just looking \Nfor a ring I happened to drop.
0.5;She worked as a dancer as \Nat a pub on third street.
0.5;Yeah. It looked like she \Nwas returning from a trip.
0.5;Detective Takagi, about \NMidorikawa Saki-san...
0.5;Inspector Megure, the victim seems \Nto have fallen from the roof.
0.5;There were scratch marks \Non the railing on the roof.
0.5;We also found a woman's \Nearring on the ground.
0.5;The building's security cameras also \Ncaptured the victim heading to the roof.
0.5;The victim took the elevator to \Nthe 11th floor and got off there.
0.5;The stairs have to be \Ntaken to reach the roof,
0.5;Her last incoming call was \Nfrom a nearby payphone.
0.5;She came to this building \Nshortly after receiving it.
0.5;Which means the person who called \Ninvited her up to a roof,
0.5;she used to be a good-natured \Nwoman well-liked by everyone.
0.5;her personality suddenly \Nchanged about three years ago.
0.5;She started extorting \Ncoworkers and customers.
0.5;You two question the \Npeople she was extorting.
0.5;Saki-san was pushed at an \Nintersection yesterday.
0.5;And there are three people who \Nhave been glaring at Saki-san.
0.5;She saw you doing something unsavory \Nfrom that window, didn't she?
0.5;And she was blackmailing you with \Nit, right, Tachibana-san?
0.5;“I saw it all. I'll tell. Don't even \Nthink about contacting the police.”
0.5;So you hastily attempted \Nto silence her yesterday,
0.5;If my students find out, my \Npopularity with them will be over.
0.5;He's innocent as far as \Nthe attempted murder goes.
0.5;Let's withhold judgment until we talk \Nto Konno Michiyo the office worker.
0.5;After all, Saki-san called \Nme and told me to stay here.
0.5;about how you tried \Nto silence me yesterday.
0.5;I heard a wealthy man was looking for a \Nlove child he conceived a long time ago.
0.5;I disguised myself as Konno Michiyo \Nin order to blackmail him, but...
0.5;We're arresting him for \Nattempted murder and fraud.
0.5;So you drugged her with sedatives \Nbefore you pushed her.
0.5;But that letter and phone \Ncall were clearly...
0.5;She might've seen their \Nsecrets while I was over.
0.5;Maybe she thought he was someone else \Nsince he looked different from usual.
0.5;I'd been traveling since \Nthe day before yesterday,
0.5;and when I returned, all \Nmy jewels had vanished!
0.5;Anyway, she lived rather frugally \Nfor someone blackmailing people.
0.5;She started extorting people \Nto pay off his debts?
0.5;She waited for him, believing \Nhe'd someday return.
0.5;It sounds like she often looked \Nout her window, but was that...?
0.5;She was waiting for him \Nfor three whole years.
0.5;Did you tell anyone that Saki-san was \Nwaiting for Suenaga-san to return?
0.5;since her investigation was \Nvery important to Saki-chan.
0.5;It even explains how they got \NSaki-san to come to the crime scene.
0.5;Dojima Tatsuko, the woman \Nwho killed Saki-san.
0.5;I know that her apartment room \N1107 is directly above here,
0.5;The woman in room 202 lost \Nher key about a week ago.
0.5;Apparently the key was turned \Nin to the building manager.
0.5;Dojima received the offer to be a regular \Nguest on a TV show yesterday afternoon.
0.5;but there are some things us \NDetective Boys can't figure out.
0.5;Why would they do that \Nto push her off a roof?
0.5;They needed it to make sense that Saki-san's \Nfingerprints weren't on the door to the roof.
0.5;Why don't you wait until \Nwe're finished to respond?
0.5;On a whim, you made a \Nspare of the key you found
0.5;Your theft would surely be discovered, \Nand even if Saki-san's memory was hazy,
0.5;if you started appearing on \NTV, she was sure to notice.
0.5;you noticed there were others \Nwho didn't like Saki-san.
0.5;But he failed, and Saki-san \Nhid the attempt on her life.
0.5;I was thinking and accidentally \Ntried to cross when it was red.
0.5;Since she knew she'd incurred the ire of \Nothers, she thought that's what it was.
0.5;You impersonated Saki-san and called \NNumagaki-san on the phone so he wouldn't have an alibi.
0.5;Then you invited Saki-san \Nto your own apartment.
0.5;You used the information you got \Nfrom the landlady the night before
0.5;and lied about having \Ninformation about Suenaga-san.
0.5;Saki-san gleefully ran over, and you \Nput her to sleep using sedatives.
0.5;You placed Saki-san on the platform made from \Nthe materials and ice you bought last night.
0.5;Then you pretended to look for a lost \Nitem on the ground and waited
0.5;One of the balloons was \Nmissing from its string.
0.5;I thought maybe got caught \Non it when she fell.
0.5;The abrasion on Midorikawa Saki-san's neck and \Nthe shape of the string were a perfect match.
0.5;And we found fingerprints matching the \Nones on your lease on the balloon.
0.5;But that connects you to \Nthe deceased Saki-san.
0.5;Despite being so stupid, \Nshe wore all those jewels!
0.5;I swiped them because she needed \Nto be brought down a peg!
0.5;Once the robbery was discovered, \NSaki-san might have blackmailed you.
0.5;Being evil doesn't give \Nyou the right to kill her!
0.5;for the Japanese Detective \NLeague's award ceremony
0.5;He hit his head when he fell. \NHe's still unconscious.
0.5;Could we keep what I'm about \Nto tell you between us?
0.5;Sorry, but could you be \Nmy girlfriend for a bit?
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “The Northern \NKyushu Mystery Tour, Kokura Arc!”
0.5;Conan's logic works great on\Nhearts tired by modern society!
0.5;Today's case is a midsummer night!\NI crush the culprit's dreams!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Obviously! This is\Nyour villa's private beach!
0.5;We're here to get a great tan\Nand catch guys all summer long!
0.5;You're always talking\Nabout guys, Sonoko...
0.5;It must be nice to know\Nwho your husband'll be!
0.5;You bought that swimsuit to\Nshow Shinichi-kun, didn't you?
0.5;Since I'm here,\NI'll get a closer look!
0.5;Oh, you! You're supposed\Nto be in love with my sister!
0.5;Tomizawa Yuzo-san, third son of\Nthe head of Tomizawa Industries!
0.5;Our two family\Ncompanies are really close!
0.5;He saw my sister at a party\Nand had love at first sight!
0.5;You're embarrassing me,\NSonoko-chan...
0.5;No, I'm here to introduce\Nher to my father and brothers!
0.5;but my father should be\Nat the villa by now.
0.5;This is the Tomizawa residence.\NWe're not home right now,
0.5;so please leave a message\Nafter the beep--
0.5;That's weird. He was\Nsupposed to be there at 3:00...
0.5;Tetsuhara-ojisama is coming!\NThis is no time to play in the ocean!
0.5;Ugh! I said to wait in the\Nvilla for me to bring her there!
0.5;It's gone! Three runs! Kogure sent\Nit into the right stands in the rain!
0.5;Dad. You're sure\Na big Kogure fan...
0.5;But you didn't have\Nto watch him here.
0.5;I had no choice. I'm getting\Nbad satellite reception.
0.5;A pop fly down the center!\NThe Falcons are on fire now!
0.5;Typhoon 11 has intensified and\Nis moving northward from Okinawa.
0.5;As a result, many planes\Nand boats are delayed.
0.5;It doesn't look like\Nthat game's on the radio...
0.5;Now, now! It'll begin soon!\NHow about some coffee?
0.5;Taichi, the oldest, ditched the\Nbusiness and became a novelist instead.
0.5;Tatsuji, the middle son,\Njoined the company
0.5;but got engaged with some\Nnobody without my consent!
0.5;You too, Yuzo!\NWith your stupid paintings and all!
0.5;I'll be in my studio.\NI have an illustration to finish.
0.5;It's over! The Falcons finally\Nwin 9-8 in the 11th inning!
0.5;This is the essence\Nof Falcons baseball!
0.5;Oh, look at the time.\NI should get back to my villa.
0.5;Geez! I wonder if he plans to\Nwatch another night game tomorrow...
0.5;See? The lights\Nare out in the other villa...
0.5;So you witnessed Mr. Tomizawa\Nbeing murdered by his son Yuzo
0.5;You know full well\Nyou killed your own father!
0.5;Taichi-aniki!\NLooks like something happened!
0.5;Tomizawa Yuzo! You're under\Narrest for the murder of your father!
0.5;We didn't know Yuzo-san\Nhad two identical twins!
0.5;I was in Okinawa\Nlast night on a business trip.
0.5;I took the first flight out and\Nlanded at Haneda three hours ago.
0.5;I couldn't have been\Nat the villa when it happened!
0.5;Say, Detective. I'm not\Nsure I can call it an alibi, but...
0.5;That's weird. He was\Nsupposed to be there at 3:00...
0.5;Kogure pulled that homer to\Nthe right in the bottom of the 6th!
0.5;11:34 pm... The time\Nthe murder took place.
0.5;You're certain it\Nhappened around 11:30?
0.5;Yes! I had checked the\Nclock before we saw the killer!
0.5;Doesn't look like he did it!\NThat game was only on satellite!
0.5;He couldn't have known how\Nit ended unless he watched it all!
0.5;Confirm that with the\NTV and radio stations! Hurry!
0.5;Yes! A fellow illustrator called\Nand woke me up! Just after 11:30!
0.5;I dozed off! I had to pull\Nan all-nighter to finish this job...
0.5;Detective Yokomizo!\NAbout that passenger list...
0.5;The plane you were supposedly on\Nlanded at Haneda thirty minutes ago!
0.5;I guess the typhoon delayed it!\NThey said so on the news last night!
0.5;How about you tell us\Nwhere you really were last night?!
0.5;Tokyo! That's right!\NI returned to Tokyo last night!
0.5;My fiancée.\NI heard she had collapsed...
0.5;Yeah! I just mentioned\Nhow the game ended!
0.5;No news programs\Nwere covering it at 11:30!
0.5;I know, because I flipped channels,\Nhoping to see that home run again!
0.5;Detective Yokomizo.\NHe's telling the truth.
0.5;It was after midnight when TV\Nand radio stations covered the game.
0.5;He's awesome! Only he could\Nhit a home run into the right stands!
0.5;You said he pulled it\Nto the right on the phone!
0.5;Were you really\Nwatching that game?!
0.5;Nothing of the sort! I meant\Nthat I didn't see the game on TV.
0.5;I listened to it all on the\Nradio while playing pachinko.
0.5;I guess the only radio broadcast\Nwas in Osaka, where I live.
0.5;He's right, only one radio station\Nin Osaka aired that game.
0.5;Besides, I left a message\Nat the time of the murder.
0.5;Who is it?!\NOne of those three is lying!
0.5;And the victim's\Nmissing watch bugs me!
0.5;Yeah, there was a 10-minute\Nblackout at 11:30 last night!
0.5;Oh, yeah! There was a\Nblackout just before the murder!
0.5;Wait, this is strange!\NWhat he said is impossible!
0.5;Then the watch\Ntaken from the victim was...
0.5;No doubt about it!\NThe killer is the one telling two lies!
0.5;I have to ask all three\Nof you down to the station!
0.5;These folks saw the killer's\Nface just after the murder!
0.5;In other words,\None of you killed your father!
0.5;I know who did it! It's definitely\Nthe one with the strange alibi!
0.5;Alright! I'll knock Sonoko\Nout and make her a detective!
0.5;It's a toy!\NProfessor Agasa gave it to me!
0.5;I've figured it out. I know that\Nhe killed Tetsuhara-ojisama!
0.5;Not one of the\Nthree has a clear alibi!
0.5;Interesting. But I was in\Nan Osaka pachinko parlor.
0.5;I don't think\NI could've been here then.
0.5;Yes, pachinko parlors are generally\Nforbidden to operate past 11:00!
0.5;I heard the broadcast in a taxi\Non my way home from the parlor...
0.5;Don't be like that.\NIt was a simple mistake.
0.5;And the major oversight\Nyou made during the murder!
0.5;Yes! The answering machine\Nwouldn't work without power!
0.5;Its batteries power the clock,\Nbut it can't record messages!
0.5;So what's your message\Ndoing there at 11:34?
0.5;But you could ask\NYuzo the same thing!
0.5;He said he got a call\Njust after 11:30!
0.5;You can still make calls\Nduring a power outage!
0.5;It's true. Telephones receive\Npower through the phone lines.
0.5;Someone must've messed with\Nthe clock to frame me--
0.5;In other words, when the game ended,\Nyou left a message
0.5;on the machine whose clock\Nyou had set ahead in advance.
0.5;As if you left the message\Njust when the murder happened!
0.5;Then you turned the clock back,\Nand waited for your father to return.
0.5;Your father, who came\Nnext door to see the game!
0.5;No, you knew.\NYou used a transmitter to hear!
0.5;I bugged your villa? Then go ahead\Nand look! There won't be any!
0.5;Isn't there something unnaturally\Nmissing from the victim?
0.5;he could keep tabs on\Nboth the victim and the game!
0.5;So the watch was taken\Nto remove the evidence?
0.5;and breaking his satellite receiver\Nto make him come to my villa...
0.5;Nice theory. I almost\Nwant to use it for a book.
0.5;Do you have any proof that I changed\Nthe answering machine's clock?
0.5;"The times match; even\NYuzo's message had the right time."
0.5;Stop that, Yuzo. I'm not the\Ngreat brother you take me for.
0.5;Things got tough. I suddenly\Nran out of work and money...
0.5;I found out when\NI went to Dad for help...
0.5;He had pressured the publishers\Nto drop each job that came my way!
0.5;I guess he wanted me to\Nquit and follow in his footsteps.
0.5;Yeah. I used his\Nvisit here to kill him.
0.5;That's also why I sent him the\Nbugged watch and broke his receiver.
0.5;Yuzo. I was going\Nto try pinning it on you.
0.5;To increase my\Nshare of the inheritance.
0.5;To think the power\Nwould go out just then...
0.5;I guess fact is\Nstranger than fiction...
0.5;Maybe I didn't have the\Nskill to be a writer.
0.5;What's with Sonoko?\NShe's spacing out...
0.5;She's probably relieved\NYuzo-san wasn't the killer!
0.5;Don't tell me she noticed\NI shot a sleeping dart in it...
0.5;What're you talking about?\NThat was great detective work!
0.5;I was supposed to get a tan\Nand catch some guys!
0.5;I know, Ran!\NLet's go to a tanning salon!
0.5;Not now! We have to give our\Nstatements at the police station!
0.5;Everyone out of the boat!\NThe tide's rising!
0.5;The waves are\Ntoo high for us to swim out!
0.5;Until just recently, I was\Na famous high school detective
0.5;But a mysterious organization\Nforced me to take a pill,
0.5;My mind is that of\Na former great detective,
0.5;and no matter what sort\Nof incident takes place,
0.5;I can't believe you know the\Nsuper-famous high school detective!
0.5;He wouldn't happen to be\Nyour boyfriend, would he?
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nwhat could Shinichi be doing?
0.5;It's been a while since\NI last heard anything from him...
0.5;The case he's working on\Nhas probably hit a hard spot!
0.5;But normally he solves all of his\Ncases without any problems at all...
0.5;someone has been sending me toys\Nand money every month.
0.5;because the sender's name\Nand address are always made-up.
0.5;Exactly how much money\Nhave they been sending?
0.5;Yuta loves the fact that\Nnew toys come every month,
0.5;but being sent money is too creepy\Nfor me so I haven't touched any of it.
0.5;If that's the case, I wouldn't mind\Nholding on to the money for you!
0.5;Do you have any ideas\Nwho it could be?
0.5;Are you sure it isn't\None of your patients?
0.5;Then it wouldn't be strange for\None of the patients you saved
0.5;to send all this to you in appreciation\Nfor your help, would it?
0.5;Huh? I don't remember\Nmentioning that I was a surgeon...
0.5;You have diagonal marks\Non your fingers, right?
0.5;surgeons use both index fingers\Nto sew tight sutures.
0.5;Over time, it causes diagonal marks\Nto appear on their index fingers!
0.5;In fact, I performed a surgery\Njust this very morning.
0.5;This kid knows all sorts\Nof weird stuff...
0.5;Only people who train on the horizontal\Nbar ever get this many blisters.
0.5;There doesn't seem to be anything\Nstrange besides the money...
0.5;No! Normally it's a much larger package\Nwith both toys and money in it!
0.5;Hey, why don't these have\Nthose line patterns on them?
0.5;There aren't any on\Nany of these things!
0.5;They don't sell these\Ntoys in stores anymore...
0.5;And it looks like some\Nhave been damaged...
0.5;Come to think of it, ever since\Nthe toys started coming in,
0.5;some of them were worn out,\Nand others were completely broken.
0.5;In other words, they've either\Nbeen sending used toys
0.5;or toys that they had\Npurchased quite a while ago.
0.5;No, it's too complicated\Nfor a simple prank.
0.5;And sending all that money for\Nno reason would be pointless...
0.5;You have such excellent\Npowers of deduction, Mori-san!
0.5;No! Dad didn't figure\Nany of those things out!
0.5;So this letter is the only\Nclue as to who the sender is...
0.5;Say, do you think the sender\Ncould be trying to buy something
0.5;Depending on how you interpret it,\Nit could mean something like that.
0.5;There is a painting in the hospital\Nthat my grandfather left me.
0.5;I'm pretty sure they said that it\Nwas worth about 20 million yen...
0.5;The sender must want\Nto buy that painting from you!
0.5;I, too, was surprised when\NI first came here 3 years ago.
0.5;I was transferred here from\Na small rural hospital, you see...
0.5;Morning glories?\NWith the weather as cold as it is?
0.5;I can only assume that the person has\Nbeen growing them in a greenhouse.
0.5;Yes, the same person has\Nbeen sending these as well.
0.5;Sending flowers must mean\Nthe sender is female...
0.5;Then could it be your son's\Nbirthday or something?
0.5;why don't we have a look at\NOgawa-sensei's medical records?
0.5;There might be a patient who has\Nsomething to do with February 19th!
0.5;I'm not allowed to show\Nthe records to other people...
0.5;Very well. I suppose\NI have no other choice.
0.5;Well, here are all of my patients'\Nrecords for the past 3 years.
0.5;And there's nobody in here\Nwho might want that painting?
0.5;Say, would you like to see\Nthe painting for yourself?
0.5;Ok. Then be a good boy\Nand behave yourself!
0.5;The painting is quite popular\Namong many of the patients too!
0.5;So this dog barks\Nat all strangers then?
0.5;How did you know this was a lighter\Nif you've never been here before?
0.5;It was almost like Shinichi\Nwas giving suggestions!
0.5;...Conan-kun showed up,\Nin his place, almost...
0.5;You shouldn't be reading people's\Nrecords without permission!
0.5;He said earlier that the flowers are sent\Nto the hospital once a year, right?
0.5;That makes me think that\Nit was a former patient here.
0.5;It was 2 years ago when he started\Nreceiving the toys and the money,
0.5;so that narrows it down\Nto patients who were here
0.5;during Ogawa-san's first year \Nat this hospital.
0.5;who have something\Nto do with February 19th.
0.5;People whose surgeries\Nwere successful on that day,
0.5;or people who were released\Nor checked in on that day.
0.5;Sending flowers most likely means\Nthe person is grateful to him,
0.5;It's amazing that you could\Nfigure that much out!
0.5;If word gets out that\NI'm actually Shinichi Kudo,
0.5;they might go after Ran\Nand the others as well!
0.5;Wow! A Game Man!\NAnd Yaiba's Great Adventure!
0.5;I think he's faking!\NIt's too suspicious!
0.5;This isn't a science\Nfiction movie, after all...
0.5;Don't tell me it's that Shinichi boy\Nyou were looking for earlier?
0.5;He's always been kind\Nof a tease since he was a kid,
0.5;and he's always been so full\Nof himself and a big mystery geek,
0.5;but he's also courageous,\Ncool, and dependable!
0.5;Huh? Ogawa-san said\Nhis son was named Yuta...
0.5;Normally you enter your own name\Nor the name of a character you like...
0.5;He died after Ogawa-san\Noperated on him.
0.5;The letter couldn't mean\Nwhat I think it does!
0.5;That tone, his mannerisms,\Nhis deductions...
0.5;They're all exactly like Shinichi's!\NNo question about it!
0.5;Did you really find out\Nwho the sender is?!
0.5;I think it might be the parents\Nof Tomoya Ogino-kun here!
0.5;The one who died of appendicitis\Nthree years ago!
0.5;It was already too late for him when\Nthey brought him in to the hospital...
0.5;The boy's father absolutely\Nwould not listen to me, however...
0.5;But why would he send you presents\Nif the operation wasn't successful?
0.5;They're the belongings of the late\NTomoya Ogino, who died 3 years ago!
0.5;In other words, he's been sending\Nall of his son's keepsakes!
0.5;because it's the anniversary\Nof his son's death!
0.5;And that letter means that he's going\Nto take the life of Ogawa-san's son
0.5;My wife should be on her way\Nto pick him up at school!
0.5;They told me his father\Nhad already picked him up!
0.5;If we don't find them soon,\NYuta-kun's a goner!
0.5;Hey, are you really gonna take me\Nto a fun place after this?
0.5;It must have been lonely\Nall by yourself!
0.5;who you killed 3 years ago when\Nyou messed up his operation!
0.5;It was already too late\Nwhen they carried him--
0.5;Shut up! As if you would understand\Nthe feelings of a father
0.5;whose son was murdered\Njust after he turned 5!
0.5;All I had left were his remains\Nand the 25 million in insurance money!
0.5;The money, his toys, and the\Nmorning glories that he loved so much!
0.5;It was with my hatred\Nthat I sent them all to you!
0.5;Now it's your turn to feel what\Nit's like to lose your own son!
0.5;Oh! So you were the one\Nwho sent the toys!
0.5;Did Daddy and the others\Nsay something bad to you?
0.5;I knew from the very start\Nthat it wasn't his fault.
0.5;But I had to fool myself into\Nthinking it was, or else I...
0.5;Wait! Please don't get\Nthe police involved!
0.5;After all, I am a father\Nbefore I'm a doctor.
0.5;How lucky it was that it didn't\Nturn into a serious incident.
0.5;But why did he send the money\Nand toys for 2 whole years?
0.5;Excellent deduction skills\Nyou have there.
0.5;But I'm just a kid so I don't\Nreally know for sure!
0.5;I just remembered\Nsomething I have to do!
0.5;You must be hungry.\NI'll make you something.
0.5;I hear our shop teacher Kishida-sensei \Nis getting married!
0.5;How do you know about\Nmy high school teacher?
0.5;No, uh, you're always talking\Nabout how he's a gorilla!
0.5;I couldn't believe it at first,\Nbut I guess you really are Shinichi!
0.5;Please, Professor Agasa!\NI think Ran's on to me!
0.5;He shouldn't have made her\Nworry so much like that!
0.5;Say, Shinichi. Have you started\Nusing words that old men use?
0.5;What's on the card that\Nhe's so shocked about?!
0.5;Anyway, I had no idea they count \Nlike this in Germany and France.
0.5;Yeah, Mom tried to act cool \Nby mimicking French people.
0.5;They count to three using \Ntheir pointer finger,
0.5;Maybe she was thinking of cricket \Nsince that's popular in England.
0.5;Cricket bats are flatter and \Nthicker than baseball bats.
0.5;after cutting your food with a knife, \Nyou switch your fork to your right hand.
0.5;You eat with your fork in your \Nleft hand in Japan and England.
0.5;That's how I know Conan-kun's \Npretty good at football.
0.5;He beautifully dances his \Nmystery-solving steps!
0.5;While looking into Sera's secret, \NI recalled a case on the beach!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;You're starting your third \Nyear of high school now?
0.5;Mom had a baby bump before \NI left for America.
0.5;I thought you came here together after \Nshe went to meet you at your hotel.
0.5;I let you study abroad because you \Nsaid you wanted to study in America,
0.5;but now you're saying you actually went to \Ninvestigate the truth behind your father's case?
0.5;And on top of that, you're joining \Nthe FBI when you graduate.
0.5;You're like a child enthralled \Nby the god of death.
0.5;I already have a green \Ncard and US citizenship.
0.5;All I need now is three \Nyears of work experience,
0.5;In the country we used to live in and \Nthis place, they drive on the left.
0.5;Do you really expect me to send money to \Nsomeone who'd say something so stupid?
0.5;I invited you to the beach \Nso you'd come back home.
0.5;before his death as he sent \Nus to this safe country.
0.5;Why don't we get some \Nyakisoba at the beach hut?
0.5;Unlike Kichi-niichan, \Nhe doesn't smile at all.
0.5;Masumi said she wanted to \Nget on top of the parasol.
0.5;You got salt from your chips \Nall over your upper lip.
0.5;I thought you were from England, \Nthe land of fish and chips.
0.5;Even an ordinary person like her can tell \Nwhere we're from just by the way we speak.
0.5;Before the men who killed \NFather discover who I am,
0.5;As far as I know, the only \Npeople who do that
0.5;And when I saw your left hand, \NI knew exactly what you were.
0.5;I saw that mark on the \Nback of your left wrist.
0.5;It's common among people \Nwho play the accordion.
0.5;Clowns play the accordion during \Ncircus shows all the time.
0.5;And there are all kinds \Nof clowns at the circus,
0.5;You still have some of that \Nmakeup under your left eye.
0.5;You probably forgot to wipe it \Noff since you were in a hurry
0.5;I've been to three countries, \Nbut I'm not part of a circus.
0.5;Wouldn't that make everyone who \Nlikes to travel part of the circus?
0.5;I'm impressed you noticed this \Nmark left by the accordion,
0.5;but I got this playing requests \Nfor customers at a bar.
0.5;It's a bruise I just got \Nfrom my violent mother.
0.5;If you don't behave yourself, \Nyou'll get in trouble.
0.5;If you hadn't said anything, \Nno one would've noticed!
0.5;If you've got business with him, \Nyou'll have to go through me.
0.5;If you don't mind having \Nyour eyes gouged out first,
0.5;Sorry, kids, but could \Nyou play with my sister?
0.5;Looks like there was \Nanother person in the car.
0.5;Well? Think you can do \Nit, Holmes's apprentice?
0.5;Tell the man at the parking \Nlot to stop anyone
0.5;wearing wet clothes or \Na swimsuit from leaving.
0.5;I spent a while at this shop deciding \Nif I should buy this shirt.
0.5;So a car broke through the \Nguardrail above that cliff
0.5;and you called the police after \Npulling him from the car.
0.5;Just a student studying \Nabroad in the United States.
0.5;I returned to Japan and came \Nhere with my family today.
0.5;since the passenger window \Nwas open all the way.
0.5;it would be strange for only the \Npassenger window to be open.
0.5;The other person most \Nlikely opened the window
0.5;before the car filled with water and \Nescaped, blending in with the crowd.
0.5;There's still air inside a car \Nimmediately after it sinks.
0.5;They couldn't open the door \Nbecause of the water pressure.
0.5;to open the window and \Nescape through there.
0.5;He struck his head on the windshield \Nwhen the car crashed into the guardrail.
0.5;It broke his cervical vertebrae, \Nkilling him instantly.
0.5;It's probably safe to assume the \Npassenger determined he was dead
0.5;But why would they pretend \Nto be one of the crowd here?
0.5;If they were a victim of an accident, \Nthey wouldn't need to hide.
0.5;who went shopping after the \Ncar fell into the ocean.
0.5;It seems this man who was driving \Nthe car that fell into the water
0.5;Apparently they've blended in \Nwith the crowd on the beach.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NMagician of the Waves, Part Two!"""
0.5;Kogoro-no-occhan learned \NKisaki-sensei was having surgery
0.5;to treat a sudden illness and \Nrushed to Haido Central Hospital.
0.5;Most people don't have total \Nconfidence in their own memory.
0.5;they ask for information about \Nthe person besides their name.
0.5;You knew he was a stranger \Nbased only on his name.
0.5;Plenty of people will say they don't recognize\Nsomeone by name even when they've met.
0.5;Some people only know\Nothers by a nickname.
0.5;"My nickname is ""Zero,"" so I \Nthought someone was calling me."
0.5;Being transparent means \Nthere's nothing there.
0.5;Do you keep all your old \Nphotos on your phone?
0.5;The other day I nearly \Nlost a fortune in stocks.
0.5;I thought my son had a simple \Ncold during his exams,
0.5;Everything would have been ruined \Nif we hadn't noticed in time.
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Also, we didn't find poison \Nin the spilled tea.
0.5;Inspector Megure and Detective Takagi and \NKogoro-no-ojisan have no idea who did it.
0.5;When the victim Suto Reina-san \Nbrought the cup to her lips,
0.5;There were no traces of \Npoison inside the cup.
0.5;You think one of us poisoned the cup \Njust before Reina drank her tea?
0.5;They poisoned their own cup and \Nswitched it with the victim's.
0.5;But only the victim had a \Nlemon slice in her tea, right?
0.5;If her view was limited, she may \Nnot have noticed a change in color.
0.5;Not that an old man who knows nothing \Nabout herb tea would understand!
0.5;In any case, it's a fact that the culprit \Nkilled Suto-san by poisoning her cup.
0.5;Beppu-san and Happo-san, the \Nculprit must be one of you two,
0.5;After poisoning the cup, the culprit left \Nthe room and disposed of the container.
0.5;and the way to the convenience \Nstore should turn up something.
0.5;If I poisoned the cup, \NI definitely wouldn't leave.
0.5;moved it, or poured a new \Ntype of tea while I was gone,
0.5;I wouldn't know which cup \Nwas poisoned anymore.
0.5;Then how and when did the \Nculprit poison the cup?
0.5;And where did the container \Nfor the poison go?
0.5;Apparently Amuro-no-niichan used to \Nbe called Zero when he was a kid.
0.5;She was able to poison the cup \Nand dispose of the container.
0.5;and watched for an opportunity \Nto switch it with the victim's.
0.5;She was able to poison the cup \Nand dispose of the container.
0.5;and watched for an opportunity \Nto switch it with the victim's.
0.5;Juri was drinking tea from \Nthat cup the whole time.
0.5;The poison was on the side you'd drink from\Nwhen holding the cup in your left hand.
0.5;As long as you're careful \Nnot to use your left hand,
0.5;She probably brought the poison to the \Nhospital before she was hospitalized.
0.5;and threw the container away \Noutside her room somewhere.
0.5;Even with a lemon, \Nshe couldn't have swapped them!
0.5;The acid in the lemon \Ncauses it to change color.
0.5;There are other herb teas \Nthat react the same way.
0.5;When you add lemons, \Nit changes from blue to pink.
0.5;In other words, these are \Nthe steps Kosaka-san took.
0.5;First, knowing your friends were visiting,\Nyou asked Suto-san to come a little early.
0.5;You had her go get hot water \Nso you could have a tea party.
0.5;While she was gone, \Nyou poisoned the side opposite
0.5;the one you were using with the \Npoison you brought to the hospital,
0.5;and threw the container \Naway outside your room.
0.5;and waited for Suto-san to \Nchoose the hibiscus tea.
0.5;The hibiscus tea is a purplish \Nred which looks very similar
0.5;you put in her cup a teabag \Nwhose contents were switched out
0.5;allowing you to serve Suto-san \Nbutterfly tea the color of hibiscus tea.
0.5;She did it when Suto-san and her friends \Nwere looking at the pictures on her phone.
0.5;to make it turn red and nudged \NSuto-san's cup with her own.
0.5;She pretended to take her own cup \Nwhile actually taking Suto-san's,
0.5;removed the lemon, and added baking \Nsoda, making it blue again.
0.5;Then she nudged the poisoned \Ncup with her own again,
0.5;she knew she could make her pick up \Nthe poisoned cup with her left hand.
0.5;You make it sound as though you were \Nwatching, but what proof do you—
0.5;There was one other thing the culprit \Nhad to remove from the crime scene.
0.5;It would be strange to find \Nlipstick on Kosaka-san's cup.
0.5;She quickly wiped it off with her finger, but \Nlipstick can be difficult to remove without soap.
0.5;In other words, if this red color matches \NSuto-san's lipstick, it will prove she did it.
0.5;If you examine Suto-san's cup, \Nyou'll find proof there as well.
0.5;A significant amount of baking \Nsoda was mixed into the tea.
0.5;with baking soda and hid it in \Nthe bottom of the container.
0.5;There's nothing suspicious \Nabout adding sugar to herb tea.
0.5;She may have hated Reina for \Nmaking her son fail the exam,
0.5;It wasn't just my son that \Ncaught Suto-san's son's flu.
0.5;My doctor told me the flu can \Nnegatively affect the fetus.
0.5;At first I thought I was \Ncareless or just had bad luck.
0.5;But then I heard what \NSuto-san's son had to say...
0.5;"But my mom said, ""Go study! \NThis is the final stretch!"""
0.5;"""It'll be great for you if it \Ntakes out one of your rivals!"""
0.5;I let you fall under suspicion so \NI could get away with my crime.
0.5;I chose butterfly tea for \Nits detoxifying effects.
0.5;I thought it might erase the \Ndark murderous intent inside me
0.5;It sounds like something \Nhappened here before.
0.5;The announcer Mizunashi \NRena was a patient here.
0.5;An injured man caused a panic trying \Nto force his way into a room.
0.5;Come to think of it, we found a damaged \Nvehicle a few days before the bomb scare.
0.5;Apparently he was a patient here, \Nbut he suddenly disappeared.
0.5;There was blood all over the \Ninside of the damaged vehicle.
0.5;Some of the bloodstains were \Nless than a millimeter across.
0.5;Bloodstains less than a millimeter \Nacross from a high speed blood spray...
0.5;Ran-san, you suddenly decided \Nto come today, right?
0.5;Come to think of it, \NI waited for her here then.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Kudo \NShinichi Aquarium Case, Part 1!"""
0.5;Ran-san, aren't you excited \Nfor the next episode?

0.5;Now I, Mori Kogoro, can take \Ndown that band of thieves.

0.5;Charging full speed ahead \Nwithout slowing the pace.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,

0.5;As planned, you'll work with \Nmy men as a master safe cracker.
0.5;Did he tell you who he was \Nmeeting or where he was going?
0.5;Inspector Megure was acting \Nkind of weird, too.
0.5;I don't know what it is, \Nbut something's going on.
0.5;but the famous detective \NMori Kogoro was here, right?
0.5;When I realized I was dealing with \Nthe same predictable guys,
0.5;I need to get away so I \Ncan contact someone...
0.5;If you don't want to die, \Nhand over your wallets!

0.5;I'll infiltrate their gang and find \Nhard evidence of their crimes.
0.5;we'll be able to arrest the thieves that \Nhave been giving the police trouble.

0.5;In any case, all the stations \Nare looking for them!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NManipulated Great Detective, Part Two!"""
0.5;Maybe the two of you are actually \Nwatching sunflowers in the theater.
0.5;It's your fault for taking \Nforever to eat dessert.
0.5;It's your fault for chatting with \Nthe pretty waitress forever.
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;The mysterious reason \Nbehind the victim's fall.
0.5;So you're sure that's the man \Nyou saw during that case?
0.5;One week ago, a robber broke into \NTakizawa Misaki-san's house
0.5;through the second floor balcony \Nin the middle of the night.
0.5;and stole precious stones \Nworth 100 million yen.
0.5;and we were going to bring in \NMisaki-san in for a line up.
0.5;So he tried to beat you to the \Npunch by silencing Misaki-san.
0.5;we found this in a storage \Nspace under the floor.
0.5;It's unfortunate we weren't \Nable to arrest the culprit,
0.5;but once we submit the case to the \Nprosecutor with a dead suspect,
0.5;The first and second floors of \Nthe parking lot were empty.
0.5;There wasn't any reason for \Nyou to go to the third floor.
0.5;If she parked a car that nice \Nsomewhere obvious, it'd get stolen!
0.5;That's why she went up to \Nthe third floor to park it!
0.5;I've never ridden in such a cool \Ncar before, so I was curious.
0.5;Just once I'd like to \Nride in a car like that.
0.5;Sometimes I feel like \Nspeeding down the highway.
0.5;Do you want to see what's \Ninside no matter what?
0.5;When we got married,\NI lied and said I didn't smoke.
0.5;So you lied even though \Nyou were getting married.
0.5;Sonoko just told me that \NTakizawa-san's family
0.5;have been land magnates for \Ngenerations, and they're millionaires.
0.5;So when he married a woman \Nthirty years his junior,
0.5;everyone accused Misaki-san \Nof being a gold digger.
0.5;Misaki-san is a victim whose \Nhusband was just murdered.
0.5;Anyway, when did that brat \Nturn into such a womanizer?
0.5;You shouldn't enter any rooms \Nwithout permission, Conan-kun.
0.5;He said listening to jazz at a high \Nvolume helped eliminate his stress.
0.5;So that's why this room \Nhas a soundproof door.
0.5;When I came in, I noticed the \Ndoor was really heavy and thick,
0.5;Didn't the sound of the glass \Ntable shattering wake you?
0.5;If Takizawa-san was murdered \Nwhile listening to his records,
0.5;he wouldn't have left a record \Nout if he wasn't listening to it.
0.5;maybe Yaginuma tried to \Ntake Takizawa to my room,
0.5;But if the door were closed, the \Nsafe couldn't have been opened.
0.5;In other words, the safe was opened \Nafter the table was shattered.
0.5;as he escaped through the balcony \Nwhen you came to this room,
0.5;would've back lit anyone \Nstanding on the balcony.
0.5;You instructed Yaginuma-san \Nto steal the jewels,
0.5;Then you called him to the \Nparking lot, murdered him there,
0.5;The palms of Yaginuma-san's \Nhands were spotless.
0.5;so his hands would've gotten dirty \Nif he tried to grab onto something.
0.5;Yaginuma-san was smoking \Nuntil just before he fell.
0.5;While he was covering \Nhis hands with his eyes,
0.5;that means you're standing \Nin front of a murderer now.
0.5;But I've been lying to \Nyou about something, too.
0.5;and had been planning this murder \Nsince before she got married.
0.5;Anyway, Conan-kun, you were \Na big help again this time.
0.5;Did Kudo-kun provide you \Nwith instructions again?
0.5;What was he going to do if \Nsomething had happened to him?
0.5;Y-You idiot, I didn't \Nhave any dirty thoughts!
0.5;You were imagining being alone \Nwith Misaki-san, weren't you?
0.5;Inspector, shall we celebrate the \Nresolution of this case with a drink?
0.5;Could you cancel my spot \Nat tonight's French dinner?

0.5;Well then, Asao-san, please\Nexplain in detail what happened.

0.5;Did anyone else hear the kidnapper's\Nvoice or any sounds out of the ordinary?
0.5;No. Other than Asao-san's shouts\Nfor help, it was completely quiet.
0.5;Which means Asao-san was the\Nonly one who saw the perpetrator.
0.5;Judging from the demands, the kidnapper\Nis likely someone from a rival company.
0.5;They demanded that I prepare\N300 million, all in used bills!
0.5;Which companies stand to gain something\Nif your company shuts down?
0.5;There's something not right\Nabout this incident.
0.5;Why did the perpetrator\Nkidnap her inside her home?
0.5;It would've been easier on\Nher way home from school.
0.5;But demanding used bills\Nis oddly cautious...
0.5;Oh, you're really good\Nat soccer, Conan-kun!
0.5;Shinichi would do that whenever\Nhe was thinking about something.
0.5;How rare it is for Jumbo to\Nbe friendly with a stranger.

0.5;At any rate, please buy us some\Ntime by preparing the money.
0.5;The kidnapper's nervous now\Nthat we know his location!
0.5;If we don't rescue\Nthe little girl soon...
0.5;It hasn't been very long\Nsince she was kidnapped,
0.5;so I figured they might\Nbe somewhere nearby...
0.5;There's no way he could have\Ngotten far with a little girl with him!
0.5;If we limit it to the nearby area,\Nthat leaves only so many schools to check!
0.5;The chimney she sees is probably\Neither a factory or a bathhouse!
0.5;There are only 5 schools in the\Narea where you can see chimneys!
0.5;There aren't any other schools\Nthat have views of chimneys!
0.5;They must not be\Nin this area after all!
0.5;She saw this building from the\Nside and mistook it for a chimney!
0.5;Schools in this vicinity that\Nhave a side view of this building...
0.5;Place the money on the\Nbench in Hyakujii Park.
0.5;Let me hear Akiko's voice\None more time!
0.5;You'll have plenty of time\Nlater to hear it.
0.5;Which means your role\Nis just about over with.
0.5;Don't be mockin' me,\Nyou little brat!
0.5;Darn it! I can't put any power\Ninto it with my body so small!
0.5;No good! My soccer kicks\Nhave weakened, too!
0.5;in my smaller body, I can't even\Ncapture them or beat them up!
0.5;I followed you and then I saw\NJumbo jump out from here!
0.5;Kidnapping case? Detective\NKogoro Mori is your man!
0.5;I was the one who came up\Nwith the idea to kidnap me!
0.5;Daddy's always too busy\Nwith work to care about me...
0.5;I thought I could get Daddy\Nto spend time with me
0.5;Even if my daughter\Ndid ask for your help,
0.5;I find it difficult to\Nforgive what you've done!
0.5;you will make arrangements for a\N1-week trip that starts tomorrow!
0.5;She and I will be going\Nthere together, of course!
0.5;Letting the dog go so he could find\Nmy daughter was a stroke of genius.
0.5;Who are you to talk?\NI was the one who found him...
0.5;Professor Agasa asked if\Nwe would take care of him...
0.5;I got a job the instant he showed up,\Nand then I solved it like an ace!
0.5;He just might be a\Ngod of good fortune!
0.5;I just transferred here!\NMy name's Conan Edogawa!
0.5;I have to go back to\Ngrade school again?
0.5;If Shinichi were here,\Nhe'd easily solve this case.
0.5;Where could that\Nmystery nerd have gone?
0.5;"I've changed my mind about you,\N""Great Detective""!"
0.5;I could never do that. I could never\Nbe as strong as Yoko-san...
0.5;We have some cookies my\Nmom baked yesterday.
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;His fingerprints didn't match \Nany criminal records, either.
0.5;While being questioned about 100 meters \Naway from Conan-kun and his friends,
0.5;Since he had a knife, was he \Ntrying to commit a robbery?
0.5;Apparently he was already unsteady \Nwhen he was being questioned.
0.5;He was stopped because \Nhe was acting suspicious.
0.5;He's suffering from intracerebral \Nhemorrhaging from a blow to the head.
0.5;It's a very dangerous and \Nunpredictable situation.
0.5;Maybe his medical records \Ncan tell us something.
0.5;I'll have one of our dentists \Nsee about his teeth.
0.5;We'll just have to wait for \Nhim to regain consciousness.
0.5;That's the political and business \Nscandal that has the media buzzing.
0.5;If that's the case, \Nthey may try to kill him again.
0.5;Ask the district public prosecutor's \Noffice for assistance, too!
0.5;I'm not sure what's going \Non, but it's exciting!
0.5;Just before he collapsed, \Ndid he say anything to you?
0.5;He was probably confused and mistook \NAyumi-chan for his own child.
0.5;The question is whether or not that \Nhas anything to do with this incident.
0.5;He was being questioned about \N100 meters away, right?
0.5;The person who got in after \Nhim was rather violent.
0.5;Ma'am, do you know which \Ncompany that taxi belonged to?
0.5;Who knows? My eyesight hasn't \Nbeen very good lately.
0.5;He's a naughty kid who's been \Nshopping here since he was little.
0.5;You pushed a man out of your \Nway getting into a taxi.
0.5;and was going to be fired \Nif he was late again.
0.5;That's why we're going to \Ncheck it out right now.
0.5;he didn't seem well even \Nbefore he was pushed.
0.5;Yeah, he told me to hurry up because \Nhe was nearly late for work.
0.5;Yeah. He didn't seem well \Nfrom the moment he got in.
0.5;but geographically, it's actually \Nright next to that other place.
0.5;If that's true, then what is \Nthat car doing parked here?
0.5;Look. There's something that \Ncould be evidence here.
0.5;There are two different types of clothing \Nfibers stuck to the bench in two places.
0.5;Now we just need an explanation \Nfor his possessions...
0.5;Genta-kun, we don't have \Ntime for that right now!
0.5;Whoever made this is awfully \Nstingy or frugal, though.
0.5;so you could reveal the \Ntruth behind the case...
0.5;Ayumi-chan, when that man grabbed \Nyou, did you notice anything?
0.5;I'm sorry. It's Daddy's \Nfault he's so useless.
0.5;You smelled something? \NWhat kind of smell was it?
0.5;In other words, it's the common smell \Ntying the victim to the culprit.
0.5;If he smelled like a hospital, \Nor in other words, disinfectant,
0.5;he could've been a patient \Nat another hospital.
0.5;You're forcing the connection \Nbetween myself and the culprit,
0.5;It's not the smell of \Ndisinfectant, but paint.
0.5;Yes. That smell stuck to the \Nculprit and victim right here.
0.5;As the fleeing culprit tried \Nto shake off the victim,
0.5;Then he descended the stairs to the\Nvacant lot below and got in a taxi.
0.5;We had forensics dust this car's windows \Nfor fingerprints at Mori-san's request,
0.5;Also, the button Conan-kun found here \Nis the same as the ones on his clothes.
0.5;What? Does this have something to \Ndo with the bribery case, then?
0.5;You're reading a medical \Njournal, so I thought...
0.5;I couldn't risk my relationship with \Nthe woman with me becoming public.
0.5;If he hadn't shown up this morning when\NI was returning from the night shift...
0.5;and found me through the \Njournal I was reading.
0.5;My daughter was taken to a hospital \Nafter that at the next station!
0.5;According to his story, she died because her \Nchronic condition took a turn for the worse.
0.5;It wasn't about whether or not I could \Nhave saved her if I had examined her then.
0.5;So I thought it was divine punishment \Ninstead of coincidence or irony
0.5;that he was brought to my \Nhospital and became my patient.
0.5;You may not believe me, \Nbut I wanted to save him.
0.5;If I had regarded his daughter \Nthe same way, then maybe...
0.5;What's this? Why do I still feel \Nlike something's not right?
0.5;When you said you'd dispose \Nof the paint-stained jacket,
0.5;The doctor may intend to turn \Nhimself in if he saves this man.
0.5;If he does that, everyone \Nwill know I'm his mistress!
0.5;Huh? Come to think of it, I think \NI'm forgetting something...
0.5;You knew they were a stranger \Nbased only on their name.
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “The \NTense Tea Party, Part One!”
0.5;On the second day of his Meijin \Ntitle match, Haneda Shukichi,
0.5;also known as Sextuple Crown Taiko Meijin, \Nreceived a letter before the match.
0.5;Inside, he found a code and \Na photo of his ex-girlfriend,
0.5;and kidnapping victim, \NLieutenant Miyamoto Yumi.
0.5;Haneda left his match and headed to \Nthe shrine indicated in the code.
0.5;Then this captured rook will break your \Nattack and shatter your formation.
0.5;Propelled forward by the \Nyears spent together.
0.5;Deciphering coded letters \Nfound at historic sites
0.5;brings us closer to \Ncheckmating the kidnapper!
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Apparently it's because the desolate \Nslope is flanked by temples.
0.5;Our destination is a graveyard \Nin the middle of the slope.
0.5;The code we found at Kiyomasa's \Nwell was written on a lance piece.
0.5;In other words, the seven and \Nthree refer to lances or spears.
0.5;Kato Kiyomasa's seven lances refers \Nto the seven generals he recruited
0.5;to strengthen his forces at the battle \Nof Shizugatake known as the Seven Spears.
0.5;Additionally, the three lances refers \Nto the Three Great Spears of Japan,
0.5;The man who was one of the Seven Spears \Nand owned one of the Three Great Spears
0.5;While drinking with Kuroda Kanbei's \Nretainer, he won the spear in a bet.
0.5;The upside down T piercing \Nthe overlapping circles
0.5;Since he called himself the Headless Shogi \NPlayer, he must be connected to shogi.
0.5;This move will fork his \Nking and silver general.
0.5;I was playing with the pieces \Nwhile thinking and made a noise.
0.5;I was so dumbfounded, I wasn't \Nthere when my wife died.
0.5;Come. Let's replay that \Nmatch, Haneda Shukichi.
0.5;The small thing next to it \Nis his son Masatoshi's grave.
0.5;Since it's a memorial pagoda, isn't \Nhis actual grave somewhere else?
0.5;I thought it unlikely that he'd send us \Nto another prefecture after Meiji Jingu.
0.5;He probably wants us to come to \Nthe place indicated by the nail.
0.5;What's curious is the rook and\Nbishop pierced by the nail,
0.5;and the overlapping \Ngold and silver generals.
0.5;Also, there's only one \Neach of the other pieces,
0.5;I have no idea what any \Nof this means, though.
0.5;"From over here, it looks like \Nthe character for ""he."""
0.5;The first code was about the \Nseven major shogi titles,
0.5;There's something written \Non the side of this piece.
0.5;"The pierced rook and bishop \Nsay ""show-off,"""
0.5;"and the gold general on top of \Nthe silver general is ""lazy?"""
0.5;The gold general riding the silver \Ngeneral is a lazy slacker.
0.5;The bishop is making itself look powerful \Nby wearing the rook, so it's a show-off.
0.5;After all, the rook is the \Nstrongest shogi piece.
0.5;The gold general is a hard worker \Nthat moves as much as the king,
0.5;and the bishop is a powerful piece \Nthat can move any distance diagonally.
0.5;Two and a half more \Nhours until the time limit.
0.5;If you want to save Yumi-san \Nand return to the match,
0.5;Besides, I might get another \Nchance at the septuple crown.
0.5;For now we should prioritize \Nrescuing Yumi-san.
0.5;Yes. Just like us, it's weighed down by \Na difficult problem and unable to move.
0.5;That's what the shogi \Npieces were referring to?
0.5;The Seven Deadly Sins were \Noriginally the eight sins of...
0.5;Vanity merged with pride, and \Nsorrow merged with sloth.
0.5;Envy was later added to make the modern \Nseven, just like the pieces on the board.
0.5;Based on the other bishop's \Nposition, it's envy.
0.5;Since the bishop can only move diagonally, \Nit can only land on certain squares.
0.5;Because the bishop was on that square, it \Nmust have been captured and placed there.
0.5;"The gold general labeled ""lazy"" is sloth \Noverlapping the sorrowful silver general,"
0.5;and the rook overlapping \Nthe vain bishop is pride.
0.5;Also, the rook was placed in an \Naggressive and high-handed position.
0.5;I don't get it, but where \Nare we supposed to go?
0.5;The only place around here with pride \Nin its name is the Hotel Hyde Pride.
0.5;He made sure we'd know even if \Nsomeone pried off the pieces.
0.5;Since we solved one through \Nthree, in a Meijin title match,
0.5;Don't worry. The culprit \Nwants Taiko Meijin to come.
0.5;If you violate that rule, the bomb \NI set inside the sofa will explode.
0.5;I warned you not to tell anyone, \Nbut you brought friends.
0.5;Well, at least they don't \Nlook like police officers.
0.5;It's time to replay that \Nmatch from ten years ago.
0.5;I'm sure you've forgotten, but I had \Nyou in check with my 4-2 promoted pawn.
0.5;I haven't forgotten that match \Nonce in these ten years.
0.5;I finally got my revenge \Nfor ten years ago, Keiko.
0.5;I got excited, and my fingers slipped on the \Npiece I was playing with, making a sound.
0.5;I'm sorry. I overheard you calling \Nthe hospital before the match.
0.5;Regardless of my wife's condition, I \Ncan't get there until the match is over.
0.5;Tell my wife I'm doing my \Nbest, so she should as well.
0.5;Wanting to end the match quickly, \NI was unintentionally rude to you.
0.5;He asked me to come get you since \NHaneda-san saved you from your kidnapper.
0.5;He took Agasa-san's car to \Nturn himself in to the police.
0.5;You were held captive for two whole days, \Nso you should at least get checked out.
0.5;After I left the café, he \Ndrugged and kidnapped me,
0.5;but he let me use the \Nbathroom and even fed me.
0.5;You have an important match today, \Nbut you left it to save Yumi-san.
0.5;I'd need to get to the Tokiwa \NHotel in Yamanashi by three.
0.5;Your credentials look genuine, \Nbut what are you doing?
0.5;If we don't hurry, Chukichi will \Nbe late for his Meijin title match.
0.5;You gave me your autograph \Nin a café the other day.
0.5;I lost last year's title \Nmatch because I forgot it.
0.5;I had no idea comedic storytelling \Nhad Meijin title matches, though.
0.5;It must be an amateur storytelling \NMeijin title match.
0.5;You've used up all your clock time \Nand have less than a minute to play.
0.5;There was a police car parked \Nin front of the hotel.

0.5;I scratched it while driving \Nin an unfamiliar place.
0.5;There wasn't a single one of his \Nwife's shoes in the entryway.
0.5;Yeah. It happened just \Nbefore this time yesterday.
0.5;It was quiet after that, \Nso I didn't pay it much mind.
0.5;Come to think of it, \NI haven't seen her lately.
0.5;We shouldn't assume something happened \Njust because someone heard a scream.
0.5;The wife's shoes are probably \Nin the shoe cupboard, too.
0.5;It'd be a different story if we found \Nsolid proof like the wife's body, though.
0.5;Until recently, I'd been friends \Nwith the wife, Yuri-san.
0.5;That's why she told you \Nwhere to find the spare key.

0.5;I know she must have had a reason, \Nbut I couldn't do anything for her.
0.5;Yoshida-san was kidnapped \Nbecause she saw this.
0.5;Are you the girl who collapsed \Nat Makabe-san's house?
0.5;He said a girl collapsed at his house, \Nand he wanted me to examine her.
0.5;I can't believe you thought Yuri-san was dead\Nwhen she was in the hospital giving birth.
0.5;And how could you mistake \Nmy brother and I for lovers?
0.5;But why did you hide that \Nyou were having a baby?
0.5;It hurt me a lot, and it caused \Ntrouble for other people.
0.5;This time we decided not to tell \Nanyone until we had the baby.
0.5;So the husband lied and the wife \Nstopped playing with Ayumi-chan
0.5;So that's where the blood \Nunder the bed came from.
0.5;Yeah. It was somewhere it wouldn't \Nbe seen, and I was shocked, too.
0.5;So I saw your husband carrying your \Nunconscious body to his car, and I...

0.5;He's right. Wouldn't we \Nnormally discuss this first?
0.5;You guys know our president isn't the type \Nof person to explain every little thing.
0.5;Guys, thinking back, I know things \Nwere tough when we first started,
0.5;but the company grew this much \Nbecause we worked together.
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!

0.5;"The deceased is the president of online \Nshopping website ""Clerno"", Kureno Jiro-san."
0.5;I happened to be eating \Nin the hall over there.
0.5;You're always sticking your \Nnose where it doesn't belong!
0.5;The bouquet Kureno-san received during the \Nmeal had a poison needle hidden in it.
0.5;When he took the bouquet in his hands, \Nthe needle stabbed and poisoned him.
0.5;Forgive me for asking, Toda-san, but did \Nyou join the company after its formation?
0.5;Yes. I began working for President \NKureno five years ago.
0.5;Until then, I'd been doing planning \Nfor an advertising agency.
0.5;I was recruited by this company,\Nwho was one of our clients at the time.
0.5;What were you going to do after \Nthe company was dissolved?
0.5;but I was planning to work with \NKureno-san on his next project.
0.5;I'd like you to serve in an even \Nbetter position on my next project.
0.5;So there's no way I would \Nhave killed President Kureno.
0.5;But we've been told the poison was \Nin the bouquet you handed to him.
0.5;I hadn't touched it since \Nthe start of the party.
0.5;Toda-san, do you have any idea \Nwhat happened to Kureno-san?
0.5;He's been overbearing \Nsince he joined the team.
0.5;On top of that, he's a big spender and \Nkeeps taking out advances on his salary.
0.5;Kamijo-san is in the most trouble \Nif this team is dissolved.
0.5;President Kureno suddenly \Ncontacted me one day.
0.5;I thought I'd live the laid-back \Nfreelance life forever,
0.5;but his terms were so generous, \NI agreed to work for him.
0.5;You didn't approve of the \Ncompany's dissolution, correct?
0.5;We heard you requested \Nadvances on your salary.
0.5;but it was awful of him to make such a big \Ndecision without discussing it with me first.
0.5;By the way, Kamijo-san, what are you \Nplanning to do after the team is dissolved?
0.5;I haven't decided yet, but since \NI was originally freelance,
0.5;I think this was done by someone \Nwith a personal grudge.
0.5;So why don't you examine \Nour belongings some more?
0.5;We did take a quick look \Nthrough everyone's belongings.
0.5;Yes, although shortly after \Nthat picture was taken,
0.5;he said he'd fallen in love with \Nsomeone else and broke up with me.
0.5;By the way, was there anyone who \Nhad problems with Kureno-san?
0.5;Yes, Kureno and I had been \Nfriends since college.
0.5;We'd been together since \Nthe site was established.
0.5;We were just good enough friends that \Nwe could say anything to each other.
0.5;He had clients entertaining \Nhim practically every day.
0.5;Inspector, we received new testimony \Nfrom the restaurant staff.
0.5;I don't want the police to \Nsuspect me, so don't tell them.
0.5;That tall man crouched over the \Nbouquet and fiddled with it.
0.5;I knew it. I knew Koshimoto \Nwas suspicious from the start.
0.5;He could have imported a poison \Nalong with the other merchandise.
0.5;Come to think of it, Toda, you're the one who \Nsuggested we throw a company dissolution party.
0.5;I know you were borrowing \Nmoney from Kureno-san.
0.5;A man just died, and you're \Nfixing your makeup.
0.5;Should you be leaving the room \Nwithout the police's permission?
0.5;He's been gone since he left \Nfor the bathroom a while ago.
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nhe hasn't been back since.
0.5;But Mister, there are police \Nposted at the restaurant exits.
0.5;Then Koshimoto-san is \Nstill inside the building.
0.5;Inspector Megure, this was \Nfound next to the body.
0.5;We were able to confirm that it's \Ndefinitely Koshimoto-san's handwriting.
0.5;The poison thought to be \Nused in Kureno-san's murder
0.5;Koshimoto-san was probably \Nkilled by one of them.
0.5;But I need to find a way to \Ncheck the back of the house.
0.5;I finally figured out the \Ntruth behind this case.
0.5;But Mori-san, the note was \Nwritten by Koshimoto-san.
0.5;He poisoned the needle, hid it \Ninside the bouquet, and killed him.
0.5;He didn't kill himself. He was \Nsummoned here and murdered.
0.5;It looks like something \Nwas dragged through here.
0.5;Which means his shoe came \Noff when he was dragged.
0.5;First, the culprit strangled Koshimoto-san \Nto death using some kind of string.
0.5;They dragged the body to the door and \Nattempted to make his death look like a suicide.
0.5;the culprit left the scene of the crime \Nwithout replacing his shoe on his foot.
0.5;Yeah. I ran into him,\Nand he gave me a toy car.
0.5;I went to the restroom,\Nbut I didn't run into anyone.
0.5;I left the room, too, but I \Njust went out into the hallway.
0.5;The only person here who doesn't \Nhave an alibi is Narita-san.
0.5;N-No way! And that alone\Nmakes me the culprit?
0.5;The culprit still has in their possession \Nthe weapon they used to kill Koshimoto-san.
0.5;You're saying the weapon isn't the \Nwine napkin hanging off the door?
0.5;If you look at the body, you can see that the \Nskin is raised just inside the ligature marks.
0.5;After strangling him using \Nsome type of string or cord,
0.5;the culprit strangled him \Nagain with the wine napkin.
0.5;But Narita-san doesn't have \Nanything like that on her.
0.5;Your bag's shoulder strap and the ligature \Nmarks should be a perfect match.
0.5;Around the time the decision to \Ndissolve the company was made,
0.5;I found a strangely expensive and \Nmysterious product among his purchases.
0.5;even though he couldn't \Ndo anything without me.
0.5;There isn't anyone who truly \Nloved that selfish guy.
0.5;Even if I hadn't done it, this \Nwould've happened to him eventually.
0.5;I wanted to someday become \Nan executive just like him.

0.5;In other words, that morning she knew \Nher neighbor would commit a murder.
0.5;and invited us to her apartment \Nunder the pretense of repainting it.
0.5;When we found the skeleton \Nin the old storage shed,

0.5;That's why Midori's out \Nbuying more right now.
0.5;That's exactly what a certain someone \Ninfluenced by his Gallicized mother does.
0.5;He represents three like \Nthis and two like this.
0.5;On top of that, his fingers \Nare taped, which means...
0.5;Basketball referees extend their pointer \Nand middle fingers to represent two,
0.5;but they use their pointer \Nfinger, middle finger,
0.5;and thumb to represent three so you \Ndon't confuse it with two, right?
0.5;I heard a lot of players \Npick up the same habit.
0.5;I'm Furuoka Midori, manager of the \NShiraami University basketball team.
0.5;who became our star player this \Nyear, Ashizawa Sumito-kun.
0.5;The other day a scout came \Nto meet you before the game.
0.5;I hope we'll still be friends \Neven after you become famous.
0.5;I'm Urushibara Fumiaki, the \Ncornerstone of our team's defense.
0.5;I'm a stickler when it comes \Nto defending and making curry.
0.5;And I'm Danno Kuninori, the former ace who \Nwas blinded by the cornerstone of our defense.
0.5;Yeah. I gently bumped him with \Nmy elbow during practice.
0.5;Because of that, you got \Ncloser to Midori, right?
0.5;I'm going to drink, have \Nsome snacks, and go to bed.
0.5;I invited everyone camping because \Nthings have been tense recently.
0.5;Now, now. He'll feel better \Nonce he has some curry.
0.5;Curry tastes better when \Nyou make a lot of it.
0.5;And food tastes better when you're \Nsharing it with a large group.
0.5;Urushibara's hiding in his \Ntent and won't even respond.
0.5;Come to think of it, Urushibara said \Nhe does them every night before bed.
0.5;He's listening to music on his \Nheadphones while doing squats.
0.5;Maybe the person in the tent \Nnext door saw something.
0.5;You were glaring at me with \Nsuch a fierce expression,
0.5;"""Grade School Teacher Wakasa \NRumi saves the day!"""
0.5;She hit her head on the trapdoor to the \Nbasement in the old storage shed, too.
0.5;to be a clumsy teacher so we'd \Nunderestimate her, but...
0.5;The origin of the fire was the \Ncandle inside the lantern.
0.5;It melted into the other \Ncandles scattered around it,
0.5;The candle fell, igniting \Ncomic books and clothing.
0.5;Then it enveloped the victim sleeping in \Nthe legless chair, burning everything.
0.5;The tent entrance was \Nzipped shut all the way.
0.5;See? There's a single strip of bamboo \Nmixed in with the melted candle.
0.5;You're familiar with the \NSleeping Kogoro's adviser?
0.5;Also, if you look closely \Nat the hardened candles,
0.5;on the cover of the magazine \Nnext to the laptop.
0.5;Which means that person \Nis one of you three
0.5;Earlier you said you were sleeping \Ninside your tent with earplugs in.
0.5;Since my tent was right next \Nto the tent that burned,
0.5;I remembered the faces and order \Nof the people who came this way.
0.5;I don't know what the three of \Nthem discussed with the victim.
0.5;Surely you didn't ignore \Nthe tent engulfed in flames
0.5;so you could observe the person \Nyou're so interested in,
0.5;Though since there was a \Ngrade school teacher present,
0.5;I may have underestimated the situation \Nand believed nothing serious would occur.
0.5;Why did the victim Urushibara-san stay in his \Ntent instead of eating curry with everyone else?

0.5;The victim was murdered while \Nholding a pair of scissors.
0.5;Even if Senba-san isn't the culprit \Nbecause he didn't have a weapon,
0.5;Did Senba-san have anything \Nunusual on him then?
0.5;he had a plastic bag containing a \Nlittle figurine about this small.
0.5;and that he was going to \Ngive it to his grandchild.
0.5;Although that store has \Napparently closed down.
0.5;Come to think of it, one of \Nthose colored balls I used
0.5;to buy at the neighborhood candy shop \Nas a kid came flying over the wall.
0.5;The one across the hallway \Nfrom the changing room.
0.5;The slippers he wore when \Nhe stepped on the glass.
0.5;The figurine inside a \Nplastic bag and catalog.
0.5;The sound we heard was pretty \Nloud for a colored ball.
0.5;But, Professor, you have tons \Nof insect encyclopedias.
0.5;It's easy to think of them as cute little \Ninsects when they're inside photos,
0.5;but seeing them move around \Nin person is a bit rough.
0.5;You figured out the culprit's \Nidentity and the trick he used?
0.5;We determined the method Senba-san used \Nto bring a blunt weapon into the annex.
0.5;The objects you had on you were \Nthe contents of a capsule toy.
0.5;Apparently the catalog wasn't inside \Nthe plastic bag with the figurine.
0.5;I threw it away since it \Nwas getting in the way.
0.5;Use the tap holding the halves together \Nto cover the holes in the capsule.
0.5;Could you throw this capsule and the \Ncolored ball on the roof of the bathroom?
0.5;The colored ball came down, but \Nthe capsule's still up there.
0.5;Could you remind me what you did after \Nbeing frisked and entering the annex?
0.5;Of course, not to perform \Na biological function,
0.5;The marble gets stuck in the honey, \Nand it doesn't roll very well.
0.5;So unlike the colored ball \Nthat fell right away,
0.5;Then it fell to the bottom \Nthe same way rainwater would
0.5;Since the bodyguard mistook the colored \Nball as the source of the sound,
0.5;But is this marble really \Nenough to kill someone?
0.5;What was inside the capsule was a \Nheavy iron ball rather than a marble.
0.5;If you put that ball inside \Na sock and made a blackjack,
0.5;You probably got naked inside the bathroom \Nso the blood wouldn't get on you.
0.5;It seems like you dressed \Nyourself in a hurry.
0.5;You washed off the blood \Nthat got on your body
0.5;in the bathroom next to the \Nchanging room, didn't you?
0.5;You could've dried yourself off \Nusing toilet paper and flushed it.
0.5;I-I thought I'd let the \Nyoung'uns handle this case.
0.5;After retrieving the iron \Nball from the bathroom,
0.5;Senba-san put the ball \Ninside a sock, undressed,
0.5;"Claiming, ""the toilet won't stop \Nflushing"" or something similar."
0.5;by Senba-san with the sock \Ncontaining the iron ball.
0.5;He fled into the changing \Nroom opposite the bathroom,
0.5;to no avail before being \Nfinished off by Senba-san.
0.5;but if he wore slippers over a wet sock, \Nthat slipper would be unnaturally wet.
0.5;So he deliberately injured himself \Nby stepping on the shards
0.5;and used it as an excuse \Nto take off the sock.
0.5;you went to the entryway \Nand told the bodyguards
0.5;Forensics has already found the \Ncapsule containing the iron ball
0.5;and even though you stepped on the \Nshard of glass with your heel,
0.5;there was blood all the \Nway inside the slipper
0.5;He talked my son and his wife into \Nit while I was in the hospital.
0.5;When I asked him about \Nit before I killed him,
0.5;he promised to pay my hospital \Nbills if I spared him.
0.5;I was shocked to find it gone once \NI returned from the hospital.
0.5;and a giant iron ball \Nwas swinging in the air.
0.5;So I smashed his head open \Nwith my own iron ball,
0.5;but in the end, I'm just a \Nman who runs a candy shop.
0.5;What about those scissors \Nthe victim was holding?

0.5;If you try to cut glass \Nwith scissors, it shatters.
0.5;D-Does that really happen \Nwhen you put glass in water?
0.5;it does still shoot off small \Nshards, so it's very dangerous.
0.5;Then why didn't he leave \Nthe letters spelling SENBA?
0.5;If the culprit realized the letters \Nspelled his own name at a glance,
0.5;That's probably why he \Nthrew the cup at Senba-san
0.5;when he came through the door after \Ncutting the letters out of it.
0.5;That way he would think the glass \Nbroke when it hit the wall.
0.5;He wouldn't realize the letters that were \Nremoved from the glass were more important.
0.5;The scissors in his hand \Nand the running water
0.5;were a hint pointing \Nto that whatever effect,

0.5;President Omura died when he was stabbed \Nin the chest with a knife-like blade

0.5;If any suspicious persons are discovered, \Nwe'll be notified immediately.
0.5;Are these all the employees \Nand concerned parties?
0.5;Yes. This is everyone who \Nwas inside the building.
0.5;In that case, could you have them \Ncome here right away as well?
0.5;According to forensics, \Na gas tank was leaking.
0.5;Koshiro-san's body was \Nright next to the sofa.
0.5;Perhaps he took some sleeping \Npills and was sleeping there.
0.5;It's possible that Koshiro-san \Ntook sleeping pills,
0.5;A spark of some kind must \Nhave ignited the gas.
0.5;Huh? Mister, there's something \Nweird on the floor.
0.5;President Omura was killed by a robber, \Nand Chief Koshiro killed himself.
0.5;but did President Omura and Chief \NKoshiro have a bad relationship?
0.5;Yes. Recently they'd been \Narguing all the time.
0.5;After all that time you spent, \Nthis is what you made?
0.5;But why did the president and head of \NR&D have such a tense relationship?
0.5;This company was founded ten \Nyears ago as a venture company
0.5;under President Omura and Chief \NKoshiro's joint management.
0.5;They produced several hit products \Nand received media attention.
0.5;I love this company's frying pans and \Napplied to review their new product.
0.5;a plan was made to list the company on the \NFirst Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
0.5;We found these in Chief Koshiro's \Nexploded research lab.
0.5;Yes, which means after Chief Koshiro's \Nrage reached its peak last night, today...
0.5;The chief killed the president \Nand made it look like a robbery?
0.5;Yes. According to forensics, this \Nmedicine bottle contains sleeping pills.
0.5;Hold on. Is that other \Nobject a gas tank valve?
0.5;Before Chief Koshiro came to kill President \NOmura, the president visited the research lab
0.5;First, he put the sleeping pills in \Nsome tea and swapped out the gas valve.
0.5;There were signs that one of the gas valves \Nin the research lab had been modified to leak.
0.5;According to forensics, it may have \Nexploded 30 minutes after it was modified.
0.5;President Omura was probably trying to kill \NChief Koshiro and make it look like a suicide.
0.5;We found evidence on President \NOmura's office computer
0.5;After modifying the gas valve, the \Npresident returned to his office.
0.5;However, he was killed \Nby Chief Koshiro there.
0.5;Meanwhile, Chief Koshiro returned \Nto the research lab, and...
0.5;Do you think you and Chief \NKoshiro could get along?
0.5;But when that happens, I'm \Ndragging him down with me.
0.5;I poured everything I had \Ninto designing products.
0.5;If he's going to keep taking my \Nachievements from me, then he and I...
0.5;When that happens, the company \Nwill be in your hands.
0.5;I can't believe that \Nbecame their final words.
0.5;We respected both of them from \Nthe bottom of our hearts.
0.5;We joined this company because we \Nwanted to be like them someday.
0.5;I can't believe they're being \Ntaken away at the same time.
0.5;There was something on the wall \Nof the president's office.
0.5;When Koshiro-san stabbed Omura-san, \Nthere must have been a lot of blood.
0.5;But there wasn't any blood \Non Koshiro-san's clothes.
0.5;The chief was wearing the same \Nclothes I saw him in this morning.
0.5;But why was there sauce \Nin the president's office?
0.5;It's evidence that someone \Nsnuck in there today.
0.5;Inspector, could you take \Na look at the AC controls?
0.5;These two clues are keys leading \Nus to the true culprit.
0.5;and left the gas valve and \Nsleeping pills on his desk
0.5;in order to frame Omuro-san \Nfor Koshiro-san's murder.
0.5;Then the culprit headed to Koshiro-san's \Nresearch lab at the research building.
0.5;They put him to sleep by making him \Ndrink tea containing sleeping pills.
0.5;to make it look like Koshiro-san \Nhad committed suicide.
0.5;Roughly 30 minutes later, \Nthe explosion occurred.
0.5;In this case, it appears as though the two \Nof them clashed and murdered each other,
0.5;By the way, Taguchi-san, there's \Nsauce on your right sleeve.
0.5;Your sleeve is at roughly the same height \Nas the stain in the president's office.
0.5;That's right. You're the \Ntrue culprit, Taguchi-san.
0.5;While in the president's office, you \Ntouched the wall with your sleeve.
0.5;When the lab exploded—no, for \Nmore than 30 minutes before that,
0.5;It wasn't possible for me \Nto swap out the valves.
0.5;Apparently iron, titanium, and aluminum are \Nhard metals that don't melt under high heat.
0.5;But there is a metal that \Nmelts at 29 degrees.
0.5;Forensics said the metal on the \Nwall controls might be gallium.
0.5;However, its melting point \Nis a mere 29 degrees.
0.5;The culprit used gallium to fill in the \Nsection of the valve they shaved off.
0.5;they set the AC to activate at \Nover 30 degrees 30 minutes later.
0.5;That's why you used the \Ngallium to delay his death
0.5;However, that became evidence \Nof your guilt instead.
0.5;Taguchi-san, there's tears and silver \Nsweat on the handkerchief I lent you.
0.5;Even a person's body temperature \Nis hot enough to melt it.
0.5;Taguchi-san touched the AC \Ncontrols with those hands.
0.5;Detective Takagi, could you please \Nsearch Taguchi-san's locker?

0.5;Hold on! Wouldn't the arrow\Nhit the tempered glass, too?!
0.5;Yes. The arrow hit\Nthe glass and struck the floor.
0.5;As tempered glass is clear,\NHiroshi-san didn't notice from outside.
0.5;Then where did the arrow\Nin the victim's chest come from?!
0.5;That's because a crossbow\Nhad been set up there.
0.5;What's a wood chip\Ngot to do with anything?
0.5;First, you stick a wood\Nchip with a string around it

0.5;Next, you attach a strip\Nof rubber around the trigger.
0.5;The string tied to the wood chip\Nis led up the chimney and outside.

0.5;The arrow had fireplace soot on it,\Nso analysis should confirm it.
0.5;So, the killer took care of the\Nglass and crossbow after the murder?!
0.5;Hiroshi-san couldn't \Nhave done it, he had run off.

0.5;After all, you wouldn't get any\Ninheritance if you killed him yourself.
0.5;Sorry, Mori-san, but when\Nmy brother was murdered,
0.5;I was at the feeding ground\Ndrawing pictures, as you can see.
0.5;The reason I suspected you\Nwas because of those drawings!
0.5;The reason being that\Ntanchous' tails aren't black!
0.5;Their plumes are black,\Nand their tails are white!
0.5;What's more, tanchous face\Nthe wind when they sleep.
0.5;But, they're sleeping against\Nthe wind in your drawings.
0.5;That's because you didn't draw\Nthem at the feeding ground,
0.5;To make us think\Nyou drew them today,
0.5;you showed us\Nan unused sketchbook.
0.5;It's true, I might've drawn\Ntheir feathers incorrectly,
0.5;but you haven't proven\NI didn't draw these there, either!
0.5;Remember when you dropped\Nyour sketchbook at the hot spring?
0.5;Yes. Conan's fingerprints\Nshould be on your sketchbook.
0.5;Very well. The proof is the\Nfeather in your back pocket!
0.5;It's a feather of the turtledove\Nthat made a nest atop the chimney.
0.5;It probably got there when you\Nstuffed the string in your pocket.
0.5;Ergo, there should be\Nsoot in your pocket, as well.
0.5;Unbelievable. Being suspected\Nbecause of my drawings...
0.5;I guess I never did\Nhave any artistic talent...
0.5;Just like my brother said,\NI lack observational skills.

0.5;Glamping is what you call camping \Nin elegance and comfort.
0.5;I'm glad we only had to \Nbring a change of clothes.
0.5;With camping, you have to \Nbring a bunch of equipment.
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!

0.5;What, kid? You're complaining \Nwhen we brought you along?
0.5;He's dressed like a woman, has \Nsloppy scribbles on his face,
0.5;a crab leg in his mouth, \Nand a note in his hand.
0.5;to eat the cooking of my husband's \Nfriend and chef Tanabe-san.
0.5;President Tosaki has been a \Nregular here for a long time.
0.5;We went canoeing, had Chef Tanabe's \Nspecial barbecue for lunch,
0.5;and relaxed with tea and \Nsnacks from Miura-san.
0.5;I stepped away from our \Nroom, and when I returned...
0.5;I tried to scream, but \Nthen I noticed something.
0.5;So I decided to make it look like \Nsomeone else was responsible.
0.5;Since I was there, I stuck a crab leg in \Nhis mouth so it would look like he did it.
0.5;You're the one who left \Nthat corpse in my room?
0.5;Because Tanabe-san is a chef, \Nand it was in his freezer.
0.5;When I returned to my room, \NI found Tosaki-san's body.
0.5;For some reason, he had \Na crab leg in his mouth.
0.5;I thought about calling someone, \Nbut then I realized something.
0.5;So I decided to frame the girl with \Nglasses who came with Tosaki-san.
0.5;Then you moved Tosaki-san \Nto Miura-san's tent.
0.5;I found Tosaki-san's body with a crab leg \Nin his mouth and scribbles on his face.
0.5;I thought about screaming, but at \Nthis rate, I thought I'd be blamed.
0.5;"I wrote a dying message \Nsaying, ""My wife did it."""
0.5;I put the note in his hand and \Ntried to carry him to his tent,
0.5;but he was too heavy, so I got \Ntired and left him in the open.
0.5;What? You've got the worst \Ncharacter out of all of us!
0.5;Conan-kun. You're always \Ngetting caught up in cases.
0.5;Oh, that? The truth is my \Nhusband was allergic to crab.
0.5;He once accidentally ate \Na dish containing crab.
0.5;Dozens of people die every \Nyear from anaphylactic shock.
0.5;If first aid is administered \Nimmediately, they can be saved,
0.5;The campground and Tosaki-san \Ntold me not to use crab.
0.5;Why didn't you mention his \Nallergy when you saw the crab?
0.5;Was that vile woman really \Ntrying to frame me?
0.5;but behind the scenes \Nthey fought quite a lot.
0.5;Based on their testimony, all \Nthree seemed to have motive.
0.5;If their relationship was \Nas rocky as Tanabe-san said,
0.5;But Tanabe-san said nothing until now even \Nthough he knew Tosaki-san was allergic to crab.
0.5;then it makes sense that Miura-san \Ntried to frame Kyoko-san.
0.5;But the only thing that's \Ncertain is that someone is lying.
0.5;Did this person experience \Nanaphylactic shock?
0.5;but his expression, the \Nscratches on his neck,
0.5;indicate it's likely he suffocated \Nfrom anaphylactic shock.
0.5;It's almost certain he suffocated \Nfrom anaphylactic shock.
0.5;Excuse me, but how long \Ndo we have to stay here?
0.5;Very well. Let's hear what \NSonoko-kun has to say.
0.5;turned it into a bizarre \Nand complicated matter.
0.5;Everyone avoided suspicion \Nfalling upon themselves
0.5;Detective Takagi, have you \Ndetermined the cause of death?
0.5;Yes. After examining the body \Nbased on their testimony,
0.5;it was determined that he suffocated due to \Nanaphylactic shock caused by some crab he ate.
0.5;then the culprit had to have \Nknown about his condition.
0.5;I'm the one who told the \Npolice about the crab!
0.5;And I didn't put crab in \Nany of Tosaki-san's food!
0.5;killing Tosaki-san using his \Nallergy causes the two of you
0.5;The person who was certain they \Nwouldn't be suspected is the culprit.
0.5;the person who used Tosaki-san's \Ncrab allergy to kill him
0.5;You must've been shocked \Nwhen the body you abandoned
0.5;Like I said before, I just met \NTosaki-san through work the other day.
0.5;Everyone, how would you feed crab \Nto a person with a crab allergy?
0.5;That's why you mixed it \Ninto the cookie dough.
0.5;It's a picture taken while \Nthey were eating lunch.
0.5;Miura-san, didn't you bake \Nthese cookies yourself?
0.5;Tosaki-san was supposed to die \Nthen after eating the cookies.
0.5;But things didn't go as \Nplanned, and he didn't die.
0.5;You needed to use plenty of cacao to \Nmask the smell and flavor of crab.
0.5;Tosaki-san probably chose \Nnot to eat the cookies
0.5;after he saw the expression of \NKyoko-san, who ate one first.
0.5;That's why you called \NTosaki-san to your own tent
0.5;Knowing you'd be suspected and \Ntheir connection might be doubted,
0.5;After that, as you all know, the \Nvictim's body was passed around.
0.5;There's something crucial \Nlacking from your deduction.
0.5;Physical evidence. Where \Nare these crab cookies?
0.5;Unfortunately, I ate all the \Ncookies from this afternoon.
0.5;What you ate were the chocolate \Ncookies I happened to bake and bring.
0.5;If the investigation continues, I'm sure your \Nrelationship with Tosaki-san will be established.
0.5;And if they examine those \Npieces of cookie, I'm sure...
0.5;What's wrong with you? \NI'm trying to feed you.
0.5;After that, I apologized and \Nasked to get back together,
0.5;So I asked him to take me \Nglamping with his wife instead.
0.5;I was going to kill him and \Nruin you and your company
0.5;We'd like to question you regarding \Nthe body you abandoned.
0.5;They must've really hated the \Nvictim to do all of that to him.

0.5;He started making movies \Nin the past few years.
0.5;We have preparations to make for the next \Nevent, so please talk amongst yourselves.
0.5;You're the great detective \NMori Kogoro-san, aren't you?
0.5;I look forward to working with \Nyou at tomorrow's film shoot.
0.5;They're filming a crowd scene \Nat Osaka Castle Park tomorrow.
0.5;They're filming a scene in which people flee \Nfrom the kaiju that appears at Osaka Castle!
0.5;But since it's a crowd scene, there \Nwill be a lot of people there.
0.5;The electrical system's having problems, \Nso it doesn't get any brighter.
0.5;Open the door. That'll \Nmake it a little brighter.
0.5;Then keep it open with \Na doorstop or something.
0.5;Either way, it doesn't look \Nlike this was foul play.
0.5;The blood's been wiped off \Nof just his pointer finger.
0.5;The victim was probably conscious for a \Nwhile after he was stabbed in the stomach.
0.5;Got it. I'll have the data on \Nthe phone analyzed immediately.
0.5;I see. It's frayed, but this \Ndidn't break naturally.
0.5;It looks like a pretty tough rope, so \Nthey must've had some trouble cutting it.
0.5;Yeah. That cut must have been made \Nby the end of a knife or something.
0.5;In other words, the culprit dropped the knife \Nwhile cutting the rope, and cut the shelf there.
0.5;I can't believe what \Nhappened to Yonekura-san.
0.5;So, how's the security of the \Nwarehouse that is the crime scene?
0.5;Including Yonekura-san, I \Nbelieve it was about fifteen people.
0.5;The new kaiju in there were \Nbeing kept confidential
0.5;so only a few people were \Nallowed to enter the room.
0.5;Anyway, I heard you got into \Na fight with the victim.
0.5;Apparently this movie was \Noriginally your idea,
0.5;I discussed and planned \Neverything with Yonekura-san!
0.5;I received a note from Yonekura-san \Nsaying to come to the warehouse at 2:30.
0.5;Yonekura-san was to leave for Bangkok \Nimmediately after the event,
0.5;so I thought he wanted to \Ndiscuss something before then.
0.5;I hope tomorrow's film \Nshoot happens as scheduled.
0.5;Now that you mention it, I \Nhaven't seen him in a while.
0.5;Yeah, come to think of it, Yonekura-san \Nwas glaring quite intensely at his phone.
0.5;It was right after the first afternoon \Nmeeting, so it might have been around 2:20.
0.5;Of the staff that had key \Ncards to the warehouse,
0.5;only two others besides Kosugi were \Nin the back at the time of the crime.
0.5;Unlike the police, every second \Nmatters in our business.
0.5;We're busy enough without \Nwhat happened to Yonekura.
0.5;Is there something you don't \Nwant to be asked about?

0.5;And with Yonekura-san out of the way, \Nyou guys could take the top spot.
0.5;Shouldn't you be worrying \Nabout yourselves right now?
0.5;Where were you and what were \Nyou doing around 2:30 PM today?
0.5;At that time, I was in the third floor \Nmeeting room planning the filming.
0.5;I was alone the whole time, \Nso it's not an alibi.
0.5;I had a girl get me some painkillers \Nfrom my car in the basement parking lot.
0.5;It took her a long time \Njust to get some medicine.
0.5;The elevator never arrived \Nbecause of today's event.
0.5;Not only that, but she said the stairs from \Nthe first floor to the basement were packed,
0.5;If he couldn't use the elevator, \Nhe must've used the stairs.
0.5;It would've been tough for him to travel back \Nand forth between the third and sixth floors
0.5;I was checking bathrooms and other deserted \Nareas for suspicious objects alone.
0.5;I didn't meet any acquaintances, \Nso I have no alibi.
0.5;High places are naturally out of the \Nquestion, and I can't climb ladders.
0.5;It's impossible to identify \Nthem from this blurry photo.
0.5;That warehouse was dark because of \Nelectrical issues, but there's a little bit of light.
0.5;The door. The door was open, and \Nthe hallway light entered the room.
0.5;That's right. Someone was \Nholding the door open.
0.5;Kouchi-san and Mihara-san \Nwere working together.
0.5;Kouchi-san helped Mihara-san and \Nhis injured foot on the stairs,
0.5;Kouchi and Mihara spotted \Nin the basement parking lot!

0.5;Those sounds are coming\Nfrom down there...
0.5;There really is something\Nin this mansion!
0.5;Something must've\Nhappened to Mitsuhiko!
0.5;Listen to me! Don't leave\Nthe room, no matter what!
0.5;Supposedly no one's lived\Nhere ever since the murder,
0.5;There's also that room\Nwith the open window!
0.5;The room hadn't been damaged\Nby wind or rain at all!

0.5;Someone's been coming into\Nand leaving this mansion!
0.5;Our moms must be worrying\Nabout us right about now...
0.5;Mitsuhiko-kun is probably\Nlost and hungry!
0.5;That's strange! There're no signs\Nof anybody anywhere!
0.5;Is this the mansion's owner\Nwho was killed 5 years ago?
0.5;And is that his wife\Nand son behind him?
0.5;and that the remaining\Nfamily members moved away...
0.5;Genta-kun? What's the matter?\NDid something happen?
0.5;Yeah! That person just now\Nwent down through it!
0.5;No good! It's too much\Nfor a kid to open!

0.5;I'm not keeping you locked up\Ndown here to make you suffer, you know!
0.5;Akio! I'm doing this so\Nthat you'll have a future!
0.5;Aha, now I see the truth behind\Nthis mansion and that murder!

0.5;You're the one who should\Ncome out of hiding, ma'am!
0.5;The photograph of you\Nand this house's owner,
0.5;His appearance has drastically changed\Nin the 5 years he's lived down here,
0.5;but the man standing next to\Nyou in the picture is your son--
0.5;The mole below his eye was the\Nonly thing that couldn't change.
0.5;I thought something was strange\Nwhen I first entered the house.
0.5;The family moved out so the\Nmansion should've been empty,
0.5;After all, nobody is so frivolous\Nas to continually pay the water bill
0.5;And then there's that\Ndiscretely placed entrance.
0.5;Compared to the age\Nof the surrounding walls,
0.5;My guess is that it was\Nbuilt after the incident...
0.5;...so that you could enter and leave\Nthe mansion without being seen.
0.5;But as for why it was necessary\Nto make the place look uninhabited,
0.5;and why you needed to keep your son\Nlocked up in the basement...
0.5;...those questions were answered\Nby your conversation just now!
0.5;There are two possibilities\Nthat I can think of.
0.5;The first is that the house's owner\Nwas killed by you, his wife,
0.5;and that you locked your son up\Nbecause he witnessed the murder.
0.5;The second possibility is that it\Nwas your son who killed your husband!
0.5;you decided to protect your son\Nby hiding the truth behind the murder.
0.5;But the weight of what he had\Ndone was too much for him.
0.5;The moans coming from this mansion\Nwere probably his deranged screams.
0.5;Your son probably wanted to turn\Nhimself in to atone for his crime.
0.5;Try to understand!\NThis is all for your sake!
0.5;Yes. You didn't want your son\Nto be known as a criminal,
0.5;so you chose to keep him concealed\Nhere in absolute confinement.
0.5;Judging from your conversation\Njust now and from your reaction,
0.5;That's right! I was\Nthe one who killed Dad!
0.5;I had just failed my\Nthird college entrance exam...
0.5;You're pathetic!\NYou're a waste of a person!

0.5;Hang in there until the\Nstatute of limitations runs out!

0.5;Do you intend to keep this\Nheavy weight on your son
0.5;were found sleeping amiably\Nin the grass outside.
0.5;Apparently the woman had put them\Nto sleep with an anesthetic
0.5;That same day, the son and wife turned\Nthemselves in to the authorities,
0.5;and a baffling murder case came\Nto an end after 5 long years.
0.5;Naturally, the four of us\Nwere scolded by the grownups...
0.5;This one's on 2nd Street,\Nand it belonged to the Eto family!
0.5;People living in the area say it's a\Nspooky mansion filled with weird books,
0.5;and a boy who used to live there\Nby himself was eaten by some monsters!
0.5;A boy who lived by himself in a\Nspooky mansion filled with books?
0.5;"Yeah! You write it with a\Nkatakana ""E"" and a kanji ""TO""!"
0.5;Okay! Let's get ready\Nto beat up some more ghosts!
0.5;This is the knife\Nthey used during filming!
0.5;Which means the killer\Nwas someone on the staff!
0.5;Now I know the truth\Nbehind this incident!
0.5;I told him you'd bring it \Nto the soccer game today,
0.5;Inscribing love and cases \Nwith deductive reasoning!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;to restore your body so \Nyou can participate, right?
0.5;The effects of the antidote \Nare still only temporary.
0.5;there's no telling what kind \Nof side effects there could be.
0.5;You've got Ai-kun's fantastic \Nidea to thank for this.
0.5;The effects of the medicine \Nwouldn't wear off,
0.5;so I was stuck in the \Nbathroom for 30 minutes.
0.5;Now why don't you explain \Nwhat's going on, Shinichi?
0.5;Did he take the antidote \Nhe needed to return home?
0.5;It's a prototype antidote to the \NAPTX4869 that turned you into a child.
0.5;Just as habitually consuming the \Nsame medicine reduces its effects,
0.5;your body has developed a \Nresistance to that medicine.
0.5;If you keep using it, its \Nduration decreases, too.
0.5;you'll have to say goodbye to \Nthem before its effects run out
0.5;I've saved you countless \Ntimes with my quick wits
0.5;when the effects of the medicine expired \Nand your identity was about to be discovered!
0.5;but you were in a great mood since you \Ngot to meet Higo-san in the stands,
0.5;I even wore a BIG hat today \Nand cheered for them.
0.5;We apologize for the sudden \Nstop due to a red light.
0.5;The doors will open once we've confirmed \Nit's safe to exit the train.
0.5;BIG might've won if \NHigo-san were in the game.
0.5;It seems to have started \Nwhile we were on the train.
0.5;I seem to have pressed the button when \NI made sure I hadn't dropped my phone
0.5;It's because you keep yours in \Nthe rear pocket of your pants.
0.5;The Higo-san strap I attached \Nto my phone is gone!
0.5;I'm sure you'll be able \Nto buy one online soon.
0.5;You're the girl from the \Ncase at Asuka-san's restaurant.
0.5;There's only one strap \Nlike that in the world!
0.5;Mitsuhiko, let me see that video you \Naccidentally recorded on your phone.
0.5;Then maybe he delivered it to \Nthe station's lost and found.
0.5;My turbo-powered skateboard \Nis being repaired.
0.5;Professor, could you drive \Nus there in your Beetle?
0.5;Since I was told I hadn't stewed \Nmy curry long enough the other day,
0.5;Haibara-san's very important phone \Nstrap was taken to Chiyari Station.
0.5;No. She's pretty shocked \Nabout the whole thing.
0.5;But I saw a familiar car \Nparked next to this house.
0.5;I got sleepy while driving \Nin the area, so I took a nap.
0.5;We're going to Chiyari Station to pick \Nup the phone strap our friend dropped.
0.5;Though if there's some reason you \Ndon't want to leave this place,
0.5;I wanted to nap a little \Nlonger, but that's too bad.
0.5;This man in the photo appears to be the \Nfather of the boy standing next to him.
0.5;Maybe he mistook the Higo \Nstrap your friend dropped
0.5;Unless you're a passionate fan, \Nthey probably all look the same.
0.5;Then we need to find the father \Nand son recorded by my phone.
0.5;Now then, how should we \Nfind this man with his son
0.5;This video was taken while \Nwe were on the train
0.5;We arrived at Beika Station \Nten minutes after that,
0.5;so if they were going swimming, \Nthey would've left earlier.
0.5;Then maybe they're on their \Nway back from the beach.
0.5;It departs from Takasaki in Gunma \Nand passes through Shinjuku
0.5;and Yokohama on its way \Nto Odawara in Kanagawa.
0.5;Or maybe they just went to \Nan acquaintance's house.
0.5;In that case, did you overhear \Nany of their conversation?
0.5;“It's about as long as it \Ntakes to watch Kamen Yaiba.”
0.5;Before his father said \Nthat, did the boy ask him,
0.5;Which means it's possible he was using \Nthe thirty minute Kamen Yaiba program
0.5;to explain to his son how much longer it \Nwould take to arrive at their destination.
0.5;It was after the train screeched \Nto a stop and everyone fell.
0.5;That boy seemed to be a first-year \Nelementary school student like us.
0.5;He said, “It's only hiragana, but I \Ncan write it now. Aren't you proud?”
0.5;We got on in the middle of the \Nthird car from the front, right?
0.5;I do remember his pale finger \Npressed against the window though.
0.5;It looks like there's \Nsomething angular inside it.
0.5;Maybe he put his cooler inside \Nhis bag since the strap broke.
0.5;April to May is the best season \Nbecause the climate means
0.5;the clams are full of \Nnutrients from spawning,
0.5;but there are plenty of beaches that are \Nopen to digging for clams as late as July.
0.5;And low tide at Chiyari \NBeach is at 5:59 today.
0.5;When digging for clams, it's best to \Narrive an hour or two before low tide,
0.5;We'll be able to retrieve \NHaibara-san's strap!
0.5;Once that boy realizes the strap \Nhis dad picked up isn't his,
0.5;we won't let anyone else take it \Nuntil we return it to Ai-chan!
0.5;She's in that state because \Nshe lost her Higo strap?
0.5;The next episode of Conan is \N“The Heartfelt Strap, Part Two!”
0.5;With you, looking for lost objects \Nbecomes a profound experience.
0.5;As times change,\Ndifficult cases grow in number!
0.5;Today's case is in a\Nmountain lodge in a blizzard!
0.5;The murder victim\Ndoesn't stay quiet, either!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;I'm taking in this nice,\Ncloudless sky first...
0.5;Along with the grandeur\Nof this snowy white landscape!
0.5;Damn. I knew\NI shouldn't have come...
0.5;Eh?! You lost the\Nkey to the rental cabin?!
0.5;Guess all we can do is call the\Nmanager to bring a duplicate key.
0.5;There aren't any\Nphone booths around here,
0.5;that cabin is\Nstill under construction,
0.5;The only thing nearby\Nis that one lodge up there...
0.5;Me, ask help from some upstart\Nwith a lodge there? Forget it!
0.5;No choice!\NWe'll open it by force!
0.5;Oh! It is Mori Kogoro-san,\Nthe detective!
0.5;I always read about your\Nbrilliant work in the newspaper!
0.5;Who was talking about\Nrich upstarts just a minute ago?
0.5;Come to think of it,\NI haven't heard your names yet.
0.5;This is Edogawa Conan-kun.\NWe're watching him for a friend of ours.
0.5;This lion-shaped door\Ndecoration is superb, too!
0.5;T-That's true. Horses\Nwould be better than lions...
0.5;Oh? You're all doctors\Nat the same university?
0.5;I've been studying under the\Ndoctor for dozens of years now.
0.5;I transferred here three years\Nago from some future-less professor.
0.5;The essay he presented \Nthe other day was wonderful!
0.5;"Oh, ""Gene Therapy as Treatment\Nfor Cancer of the Large Intestine""?"
0.5;The whole medical school\Nis praising his essay right now!
0.5;Come now, with my brains,\Nit was a piece of cake!
0.5;Oh no! I forgot to buy\Nsnacks to go with our drinks!
0.5;I'll go pick some up at the\Nshop at the bottom of the mountain.
0.5;Yes, yes. Here, write it all\Ndown so I know what to buy.
0.5;The convenience store\Ncloses before 10:00, so hurry!
0.5;He's addicted to a melodrama\Nthat gets 30% ratings!
0.5;Night skiing.\NI haven't gotten my fix yet.
0.5;Say, did you call the cabin\Nmanager about our key?
0.5;That's all right!\NYou can stay the night here!
0.5;Your father can't exactly\Nleave in his state...
0.5;Wait! Tsutomu-san!\NDon't leave me!
0.5;I have to, Mitsue-san.\NWe can never be together.
0.5;It must've been rough\Nwith the sudden blizzard!
0.5;Man, can't possibly night ski\Nwith that blizzard out there!
0.5;Maybe it was Dr. Oyama?\NHe does love ice cream...
0.5;and replays the\Nbest scenes afterward.
0.5;The great detective,\NMori Kogoro, is here!
0.5;I'm sure that he, if anyone,\Nwill get this message!
0.5;I'd appreciate it if you don't\Nmess up the murder scene!
0.5;or an ambulance\Nhere in this blizzard!
0.5;Looks like I, the great Mori Kogoro,\Nwill have to take charge here!
0.5;no one's touched\Nanything in the room, right?
0.5;No, nothing aside\Nfrom Dr. Oyama's body.
0.5;You found him first,\NNakahara-san.
0.5;That's right.\NI saw him covered in blood
0.5;Was there anything\Nof value in this room?
0.5;He does have a safe in the\Ncabinet to the right of the TV.
0.5;He always carried large\Nsums of money with him.
0.5;It's almost as if he\Ncrawled to the wall...
0.5;Could this be a dying\Nmessage from Dr. Oyama?!
0.5;So they used tape on the window\Nto muffle the sound, then snuck in...
0.5;They were even nice enough to\Nleave footprints outside the window!
0.5;I hate to ask, but could\Nyou examine him for me?
0.5;As doctors, you're more\Nqualified than I am.
0.5;Even his beloved gold\Nwatch is covered in blood!
0.5;Quit joking around at\Na time like this!
0.5;I estimate his time of death to\Nbe between 9:30 and 10:00 pm.
0.5;I see. So it was\Nduring his TV drama?
0.5;There are countless cuts\Nall over his body,
0.5;but it appears\Nhe died of suffocation
0.5;He probably suffered terribly\Nfor ten or fifteen minutes...
0.5;This was most likely\Ndone for monetary gain.
0.5;After breaking in\Nthrough the window,
0.5;the killer attacked and tied up\NDr. Oyama, who was watching TV,
0.5;then demanded the safe\Ncombination, but didn't get it.
0.5;Enraged, the culprit stabbed\NOyama-san and fled back out the window.
0.5;Oh! This man has a cool watch!\NIt's all sparkly!
0.5;Then he was super lucky the\Nkiller didn't take his gold watch!
0.5;How odd for someone after\Nmoney to overlook a watch like that...
0.5;But don't you think the\Nkiller must've been gutsy?
0.5;If it was me, I'd be afraid\Nsomeone else was in the room
0.5;and would sneak around\Nand peek in before going inside!
0.5;Scratching the safe and tying\NOyama-san up was camouflage,
0.5;meant to make it look\Nlike this was about money...
0.5;The killer knew Oyama-san\Nwould be watching TV alone then...
0.5;In other words,\None of you four is the killer!
0.5;I left at 9:00 and\Nreturned at around 9:50.
0.5;The only snacks that were sold\Nout were salad and ice cream.
0.5;But you could've finished\Nsooner if you rushed in your car.
0.5;If you think I'm lying,\Nyou can try it with my car!
0.5;I went night skiing, a ski slope\Nalso forty minutes round-trip.
0.5;I cleaned up and washed things\N with Ran-chan and Conan-kun.
0.5;She only left for two or three\Nminutes to throw out the trash.
0.5;I was taking a bath from\N9:30 until shortly after 10:00.
0.5;There's one other person besides\NKanazawa-san with a flimsy alibi.
0.5;Wait a minute. The blood-smeared\Ntablecloth... Could it be?!
0.5;It matches perfectly!\NThis lighter was sitting here!
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nthis afternoon, Oyama-san said...
0.5;I was hoping for a horse,\Nbut I guess that was asking too much...
0.5;That was when he\Nasked me and Ran our names...
0.5;That's it! A horse!\NThat's what he meant!
0.5;This really is Oyama-san's\Ndying message!
0.5;It explains his\Nformal way of sitting,
0.5;Hey, mister. There's\Nsomething weird on the sofa--
0.5;Eh?! What, now?!\NWhat did you figure out?!
0.5;The killer. I just now figured\Nout who stabbed Oyama-san!
0.5;First is Tobita-san,\Nwho went night skiing.
0.5;He wouldn't have made up a\Nfake story that could be easily verified.
0.5;You only left Ran and\NConan for two or three minutes.
0.5;Not enough time to\Nhave killed Oyama-san.
0.5;Hold on! I bought the snacks\Nthat everyone asked--
0.5;No, you didn't forget.\NYou don't know.
0.5;Because you bought large amounts\Nof all kinds of snacks in advance.
0.5;You bought them this afternoon\Nwhen you bought the food for dinner.
0.5;Before the murder,\Nyou took everyone's orders,
0.5;and pulled out\Nthe snacks they ordered.
0.5;Now that you had an alibi,\Nyou went and murdered Oyama-san.
0.5;Doesn't it seem like\Nsomething was on it?
0.5;Please put it on the table so\Nthat it matches with the blood stains.
0.5;Think back. Oyama-san\Ndied while sitting formally.
0.5;Each of your names includes characters\Nused in shogi (Japanese chess).
0.5;Yes. You make up all\Nthe pieces but a knight.
0.5;Ran. Take the lighter on the\Nsofa and put it on the tablecloth.
0.5;There's only one place the blood\Non the lighter matches the tablecloth.
0.5;This is a dying message that\Ngives your name, Nakahara Kaori-san!
0.5;But how did you know that before\Nputting the tablecloth on the table?
0.5;That square is the only\None with long blood trails.
0.5;In other words, it was on\Nthe very edge of the table.
0.5;It just coincidentally\Nturned out that way!
0.5;It was you who tossed\Nthe tablecloth aside, yes?
0.5;No! It must've happened when\Nthe killer and Dr. Oyama struggled!
0.5;No. The blood on\Nthe table ends cleanly,
0.5;and the sofa the bloody lighter\Nwas on has no blood at all.
0.5;This is proof that someone\Nmoved it after the blood dried.
0.5;In other words, the killer\Nmust've returned to the scene,
0.5;noticed the message,\Nand tossed it aside!
0.5;Your undoing was that you noticed\Nthe message after you screamed.
0.5;you said they were out\Nof salad and ice cream,
0.5;but setting aside the salad,\Nselling out of ice cream is--
0.5;I couldn't believe he'd\Nsteal my paper from me!
0.5;"""Gene Therapy as Treatment for\NCancer of the Large Intestine""?!"
0.5;That's right!\NHe stole it from me!
0.5;After I had spent six whole\Nyears pouring my life into that essay!
0.5;My father died of large intestinal\Ncancer when I was very young.
0.5;The reason I became a doctor\Ndevoted to large intestinal cancer
0.5;Yet, after he stole the paper\NI had finally completed, that man...
0.5;Nobody'll listen to\Nyou if you said you wrote it.
0.5;But society will pay attention if\Na famous professor makes it public!
0.5;I'm sure your father\Nwould be happier that way!
0.5;I decided to kill the man who\Nstomped on my feelings for my father
0.5;by puncturing his lungs,\None of the worst ways to die...
0.5;But I never once imagined\Nhe would leave a dying message
0.5;They were sold out of salad,\Nbut I did buy ice cream.
0.5;"and told myself,\N""OK, time to kill him."""
0.5;And then I suddenly\Nthought back to my father.
0.5;After spacing out for a while,\Nthe car's heater had melted it...
0.5;To think his ice\Ncream would trip me up...
0.5;Dying messages. Sometimes,\Nthey're expressed in unusual ways.
0.5;Sometimes, when you change\Nyour perspective of something ordinary...
0.5;Just because you've\Nbeen in water before
0.5;Don't tell me you painted\Nwhat you saw from here?!
0.5;This is! Ah, now I get it!\NThat person was the killer!
0.5;Yes, this was a murder\Nmade to look like an accident!
0.5;Come on, Genta.\NLet's do it again.
0.5;Detective Conan Episode 933 “The \NThoroughbred Kidnapping Case (Part One)”
0.5;Ran-neechan will get mad at \Nme if you run out of money!
0.5;and he gambled away all of it in \Njust half a day the other day.
0.5;Excuse me. Are you the great \Ndetective Mori Kogoro-sensei?
0.5;Excuse me. I'm unfortunately \Nout of business cards.
0.5;but there's something fishy about \Nall these horse racing jobs!
0.5;...with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;“The Thoroughbred Kidnapping \NCase, Part One!”
0.5;I write horse racing predictions \Nand reviews online.
0.5;I don't know what's going on, but \Nthere's something fishy about these jobs.
0.5;She's worried because of \Nwhat the jobs are about.
0.5;If you're near a track when you get paid, \Nyou might spend all of it like always.
0.5;Are you sure you should've accepted \Nthe same job three times?
0.5;White Spirits, the horse \Nwith the pure white soul.
0.5;No wonder they say he's \Nthe horse of the decade.
0.5;I see. So you're the owner \Nof that amazing horse.
0.5;Tokuyoshi-san, I understand you've \Nbeen receiving death threats...
0.5;...against White Spirits \Nsince about a month ago.
0.5;Detectives are bound to confidentiality, \Nso I cannot answer your question,
0.5;but I've been hired to investigate \Nand protect White Spirits...
0.5;The next day, White Spirits was being \Ntransported to a track outside Tokyo...
0.5;I wasn't sure Conan-kun \Ncould handle it alone.
0.5;Just kidding. I'm actually \Na White Spirits fan.
0.5;I just like how fast and \Nbeautiful White Spirits is.
0.5;If something were to happen \Nto White Spirits...
0.5;White Spirits will appear \Nin the race as planned.
0.5;Nothing's gonna happen with the \Ngreat detective Mori Kogoro on the job.
0.5;It looks like him, but it's \Na totally different horse.
0.5;“Gather 100 million yen in ransom and wait \Nat your house for us to contact you.”
0.5;That's right. That's the only \Nplace they could've done it.
0.5;My wife and child were kidnapped! \NI was being threatened!
0.5;They told me to park the trailer \Nthere and get in the other one.
0.5;They said they'd kill my wife and \Nchild if I didn't. I had no choice.
0.5;You're right. There's no \Nconstruction happening at all.
0.5;They're tire marks from the real \Ntrailer the culprit drove away...
0.5;...after the driver Shiomi-san \Ngot into the other trailer.
0.5;It's called the “the \NAdventure of Silver Blaze.”
0.5;It's a Sherlock Holmes story \Nwritten by Conan Doyle.
0.5;But they were blindfolded, so they \Ndon't know anything about the culprit.
0.5;He said he was going out alone with \NWhite Spirits' 100 million yen ransom.
0.5;We can't ignore a crime happening \Nright before our eyes.
0.5;We'll follow them carefully so neither \Nthe culprit nor Tokuyoshi notice.
0.5;I wonder what word is \Nnormally abbreviated as ST.
0.5;Tokuyoshi Kozo-sama from \NYagiri-cho, you have a message.
0.5;There was a phone call for \NTokuyoshi about thirty minutes ago.
0.5;the culprit must've come out of hiding \Nand switched out the contents.
0.5;The next day, there was another \Nsudden development in the case.
0.5;You think you've used the great Mori \NKogoro, but you haven't at all!
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “The \NThoroughbred Kidnapping Case, Part Two!”
0.5;High school student Shinichi was forced\Nto take a drug that shrunk him.
0.5;Although smaller, my mind remains\Nthat of a sharp detective!
0.5;Even with her happiness about to crumble,\Nthere's always only one truth!
0.5;Today, a middle school teacher\Nthat Ran and I had is getting married.
0.5;I just wanted to see the wacko\Nwho's marrying her.
0.5;Matsumoto-sensei... I haven't\Nseen her since we graduated!
0.5;Maybe we'll get to hear her amazing\Nsinging voice at the reception!
0.5;You know, the kid who would\Nalways get yelled at
0.5;for being off key in\NMatsumoto-sensei's music class...
0.5;So you brought this kid\Nwith you instead of Mr. Tone-Deaf?
0.5;"""Waiting Room""\NAw, Kudo-kun can't make it?"
0.5;How I wanted to show off this dress\Nin front of that impertinent brat!
0.5;Make sure the kiss scene\Nis a really great one!
0.5;Come to think of it, she was always\Ndrinking lemon tea.
0.5;Wait! Your lipstick will come off\Nif you drink it like that.
0.5;What are you talking\Nabout at a time like this?
0.5;that your new hubby\Nused to be my boyfriend!
0.5;I have another can,\Nwould one of you like it?
0.5;Inspector Megure!\NWhat are you doing here?
0.5;That's right. He's the police\Nsuperintendent and my father!
0.5;Anyway, Sayuri, are you really sure\Nyou want to marry him?
0.5;I have young men with plenty\Nof backbone working for me!
0.5;Really now! You always have to\Ntreat me like a child, don't you?!
0.5;You're beautiful. Though not nearly\Nas beautiful as your dead mother.
0.5;Lemon tea suits you well,\NMatsumoto-sensei.
0.5;I always believed that only I\Ncould ever make you happy.
0.5;Wasn't there an\Nelectronics store near here?
0.5;Jeez, you'd think to at least check\Nthat before leaving the house...
0.5;Just looking at your face\Nmakes me want to pinch you!
0.5;After all, Kudo-kun looked\Njust like my very first boyfriend...
0.5;His family ran the\Nneighborhood candy store,
0.5;and whenever someone was bullying me,\Nhe'd always come to my rescue!
0.5;He would always secretly steal\Nmy favorite drink from his own store
0.5;Unable to forget those memories,\NI still drink it all the time.
0.5;So he was the reason I was\Ntormented for three long years?
0.5;No. One day, he suddenly moved away,\Nand I've never seen him since.
0.5;Hey, what're you being so\Nshy about? You're the groom!
0.5;You're the successor\Nto the Takasugi Group!
0.5;Oh! You're one of\Nthose Suzuki plutocrats!
0.5;and people say that the Takasugi family's\Ngoing to end with him...
0.5;Where did that come from\Nall of a sudden?
0.5;But she's with him,\Nso I think he'll be all right...
0.5;Sorry to interrupt, but it's\Nalmost time for the ceremony.
0.5;It would seem that sodium hydroxide\Nwas mixed in with the lemon tea.
0.5;I see. So the perpetrator filled\Nthis capsule with sodium hydroxide,
0.5;If so, then it would take time\Nfor the poison to be released,
0.5;making it impossible to determine\Nwhen the crime was committed.
0.5;In other words, any one of you six\Nwho entered her room
0.5;You can't be serious!\NDoes that make me a suspect too?!
0.5;There are capsules that dissolve in\Nhot water in only a few minutes' time.
0.5;Come now, a police superintendent\Nwould never poison his own daughter.
0.5;No, the boy's right. I'm a suspect\Njust as much as the others.
0.5;You're right! Did we\Nleave it on when we left?!
0.5;It looks like the actual poisoning\Nwasn't caught on tape.
0.5;Though the video shows that nearly\Neveryone touched the can at least once.
0.5;Meaning that everyone had\Nthe chance to poison the drink.
0.5;I wonder if Matsumoto-sensei's\Nsurgery is over...
0.5;I'm reminded of a little girl\NI liked a lot a long time ago...
0.5;Inspector. The results of\Nthe analysis have come back.
0.5;First, assuming the capsule\Nwas added to the lemon tea,
0.5;it would apparently take 15\Nto 16 minutes for it to dissolve.
0.5;at least 15 minutes\Nbefore she collapsed.
0.5;Assuming she collapsed to\Nthe floor one minute earlier,
0.5;then that means the poison\Nwas added before 1:30.
0.5;It was exactly 1:30 when\NSuperintendent Matsumoto left.
0.5;Which rules out both\Nthe groom and myself.
0.5;We came to see\NMatsumoto-sensei after he did.
0.5;We found something strange\Nabout the poisoned can...
0.5;The superintendent's fingerprints\Naren't anywhere on it!
0.5;Say, mister. Were the superintendent's\Nfingerprints the only ones missing?
0.5;No, that Umemiya person's\Nweren't on it either.
0.5;In that case, where did\Nthat capsule come from?
0.5;That's it! I've figured out\Nthe culprit's intention!
0.5;Inspector. I found this in\Na trash can in the hallway.
0.5;This could be the container the perpetrator\Nused when poisoning the tea!
0.5;that absorbs water in the air and\Nturns into a liquid in mere minutes!
0.5;It was that bastard\Nwho smeared her dress with blood!
0.5;We want to see Matsumoto-sensei\Nat the hospital right away!
0.5;Hold on a little longer! We're not\Nfinished with our investigation!
0.5;Old man Mori isn't around today,\Nso I'll need a pinch hitter!
0.5;I figured out who poisoned\NMatsumoto-sensei's lemon tea.
0.5;Yes, because it would take 15\Nto 16 minutes for the capsule to dissolve.
0.5;That's assuming the poison\Nwas really in that capsule.
0.5;All we're sure of is that the capsule\Nwas floating in the poisoned lemon tea.
0.5;Yes. The poison and the capsule\Nwere added in separately
0.5;to fool us into thinking that the poison\Nwas added at least 15 minutes prior.
0.5;If that's true, then you two\Ncould have done it as well!
0.5;Hold on. Everything she's\Nsaying is pure conjecture.
0.5;It really might have\Nbeen a poison capsule.
0.5;Inspector. Take a close look at\Nthe can of lemon tea on the screen.
0.5;The labels are facing\Ndifferent directions!
0.5;Ran. Do you remember where I put\Nmy lemon tea when this happened?
0.5;You were in a hurry\Nso you put it on the table...
0.5;The reason it looks\Nlike there's only one can
0.5;is because the two cans\Nare perfectly lined up!
0.5;She took my can, which just\Nhappened to be in front!
0.5;the poisoned can was devoid of\Nthe fingerprints of the superintendent
0.5;even though they clearly\Nhad held the can earlier.
0.5;I'd bet that my fingerprints\Nare on it, though.
0.5;...That some time between her taking\Nthe wrong can and collapsing,
0.5;someone put the poison\Nand the capsule in separately.
0.5;when Ran and I returned\Nfrom buying batteries,
0.5;Takasugi-san was holding the can\Nand then she took it from him,
0.5;so it would've been impossible\Nfor me or Ran to poison it!
0.5;But if she did mix the poison in\Nto kill herself,
0.5;she would've added it shortly\Nbefore collapsing to the floor.
0.5;And to do that,\Nshe would need two things.
0.5;It takes only a few minutes for\Nsodium hydroxide to turn to liquid
0.5;so she would have needed a\Ncontainer to safely store it in.
0.5;Which is proof that someone\Nother than Matsumoto-sensei
0.5;the only one who could've slipped\Nthe poison into the lemon tea...
0.5;If you wanna know so badly,\Nthen I'll tell you!
0.5;When a car that you were\Nchasing ran over my mother!
0.5;From that day forth, I never once\Nforgot your cruel, heartless face!
0.5;Yes. I didn't see her--she was\Nobscured by the car's shadow.
0.5;Later on, I learned of the accident\Nand rushed to his house,
0.5;I was adopted by the Takasugi family\Nas they had no children of their own.
0.5;Then seven years ago,\NKazumi brought a girl with her!
0.5;Yes! The instant I learned\Nthat she was your daughter,

0.5;I helped make the kite. \NI deserve at least this much.
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;An ingenious trick creates \Nthe illusion of an accident.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;We just have to win an award at the \Nkite flying event we're attending.
0.5;Kites that win awards for flying the highest\Nor having the most unique design
0.5;It would be a super effective \Nform of advertisement.
0.5;I really want to know what's \Nmaking her so happy.
0.5;I think it was one of \NOkino Yoko-chan's songs.
0.5;It's probably some dumb song \Nthat's popular right now.
0.5;why don't you figure it out \Nfor yourself, Mr. Master Detective?
0.5;It might be the theme song \Nof a drama she's into.
0.5;She hasn't been matching \Nmany dramas recently,
0.5;but she watched the special on Big \NOsaka's Higo a bunch of times.
0.5;She was especially into pictures from \Nwhen the soccer team he captained
0.5;When he has time, he still watches \Nhis alma mater's matches.
0.5;Lately his school's baseball team has \Nbeen getting more attention, though.
0.5;Higo-san attended a Kanto \Nhigh school, didn't he?
0.5;Come to think of it, his teammate \NSanada appeared on the special.
0.5;He revealed all sorts of things about \NHigo, including his more unusual tastes.
0.5;Do you think it has \Nsomething to do with Higo?
0.5;It's possible it hasn't \Nbeen updated yet, though.
0.5;Ayumi-chan can hide it on her \Nperson and approach Haibara.
0.5;the identity of the song \Nwill be made plain as day.
0.5;Next up are Team Detective \NBoys and Team Café Renno.
0.5;Bring it a little farther back so \Nthe wind hits it from the front!
0.5;If you promise not to tell\NEdogawa-kun, I'll tell you what it is.
0.5;It's wrong to secretly \Nrecord a girl's secrets!
0.5;I told you I was going to a kite \Nflying event this afternoon.
0.5;There's something wrong with \Na wife who trusts a husband
0.5;who lies to her about having \Nan affair with some woman!
0.5;Last night, my sister sliced \Nher wrists in the bathroom.
0.5;She was stupid for believing you'd \Nactually leave your wife for her,
0.5;Your friend Yatsukoshi was deeply \Nin love with my sister, too.
0.5;Are you sure you dropped it in \Nfront of these portable toilets?
0.5;U-Um, because I heard an announcement saying \Nit was our turn to fly our kite.
0.5;Do you remember anyone who was \Nstanding nearby at the time?
0.5;Maybe they thought they dropped their own \Nphone when they tripped and took it with them.
0.5;Then maybe it was someone flying their kite at\Nthe same time as Edogawa-kun and the boys.
0.5;Then we can call the phone \Nonce their turn is over.
0.5;Even if we reattach the \Ntail, it still won't fly.
0.5;He swallowed a bunch of water, and now \Nhe's unconscious and in serious condition.
0.5;while Renno-san was holding \Nhis kite and backing up,
0.5;he had the misfortune of \Nslipping between the posts
0.5;where the rope was cut \Nand fell into the river.
0.5;It probably broke apart a while \Nago and was left that way.
0.5;We'll let the appropriate \Nauthorities handle the rest.
0.5;Detective Takagi, try tying the \Ntwo ends of the rope together.
0.5;But if they were exposed to \Nthe elements for a long time,
0.5;The rope on the bottom is so \Nlong there's some left over.
0.5;one end of the rope has \Nbeen bleached by the sun,
0.5;It's probably the rope from \Nthe post on the very end.
0.5;The tip of the rope on the end \Nwould be worn from exposure.
0.5;Someone untied it, matched the \Nlength, and tied it back on here
0.5;had a brand new cut on it and wasn't \Nattached to the post next to it.
0.5;The post on the other end didn't \Nhave a rope on it, either!
0.5;someone did it to make the man\Nwho nearly drowned fall in the river.
0.5;But that man was holding his \Nkite and backing up, right?
0.5;Besides, he thought there \Nwas a rope behind him.
0.5;You might watch your feet to make sure you \Ndon't step on your kite's tail, though.
0.5;Then if someone drew him to this spot \Nbetween the posts without a rope,
0.5;is that fat man who was helping the \Nman who nearly drowned fly his kite.
0.5;it would be possible for him to tell \Nthe other man where to stand, right?
0.5;He was speaking with the man who nearly \Ndrowned just before he fell into the river.
0.5;speaking of conversations, before \Nthe man fell into the river,
0.5;But when I answered the phone and told \Nher her husband fell into the river,
0.5;as a material witness \Nin an attempted murder.
0.5;One of the three people I \Nmentioned probably did it.
0.5;But how did the suspect\Ncarry out their plan
0.5;You think I drew Renno-san to an area without\Na rope and made him fall into the river?
0.5;The culprit may be someone \Nother than those three.

0.5;I guess he wouldn't be.\NHis shoes weren't at the door...

0.5;C'mon, Conan-kun.\NAre you really not here?
0.5;Damn. If only we had touched\Nmuch more obvious stuff...
0.5;No question about it!\NHijikata-san is the killer!
0.5;He used this trick to deceive us\Nand lead us to this deceptive place!
0.5;Detective Mori! Is it true there\Nwas a murder in this building?!
0.5;I hear that the deceased is\NNagakura Isami, the former actress,
0.5;and that you've been to\Nthe murder scene!
0.5;Mori-san has the press' undivided\Nattention by the front entrance.
0.5;The reporters at the back entrance\Nhave started to come to the front.
0.5;While Mori-kun\Nhas them distracted,
0.5;we'll bring the suspect, Okita-san,\Nand the witness, Hijikata-san,
0.5;down from the 5th floor, and head\Nto the station out the back door.
0.5;Kogoro-ojisan said he\Nhas a favor to ask you!
0.5;Seems fishy if you ask me!\NI bet you don't know anything at all!
0.5;This is still a secret!\NDon't let the inspector hear!
0.5;You saw Isami-san collapse\Nonto the veranda next door
0.5;And that veranda belongs to\NOkita Hajime, who lives on the 5th floor,
0.5;and when the\Npolice rushed in afterward,
0.5;both the body\Nand Okita were there?!
0.5;It's me! Get a camera and\Nnewscaster here on the double!
0.5;What do you mean?!\NPlease explain, Mori-san!
0.5;Alright! Hurry out the back door\Nwhile Mori-kun's distracting them!
0.5;Are you saying someone\Nelse killed her, Mori-san?!
0.5;Yeah. The killer used a trick to\Nfool my eyes into seeing it like that.
0.5;Isn't that right? The real killer,\Nwho's trying to sneak out the back...
0.5;He was with you when\Nyou saw Isami-san fall over!
0.5;He was even in his 5th floor apartment,\Nwhere the body was found,
0.5;Don't tell us it had to do\Nwith his affair with Isami-san?!
0.5;We'll be questioning\Nhim soon about all of that.
0.5;Yes, given these circumstances,\NHijikata-san couldn't have done it,
0.5;Assuming the veranda we\Nwitnessed Isami-san fall onto
0.5;Assuming the veranda we\Nwitnessed Isami-san fall onto
0.5;It's mine, Inspector. It seems\Nto have rung at the perfect time.
0.5;Are you saying your cell phone\Nwill help explain the incident?!
0.5;at the unusual\Nsight Hijikata-san created.
0.5;Why did you call Mori-kun's phone?\NWhere are you, anyway?!
0.5;The living room in Hijikata-san's\Nextra apartment on the 6th floor...
0.5;It's the same. The TV, the sofa,\Nthe curtains, the table...
0.5;It's all exactly identical to his\Nliving room directly below this one!
0.5;The only difference\Nis that the 5th floor room
0.5;has four cups filled\Nwith tea on the table,
0.5;Why are your living rooms on the\N5th and 6th floors exactly alike?
0.5;that Isami-san collapsed on the 5th\Nfloor veranda, rather than the 6th.
0.5;while he strangled\NIsami-san in the 5th floor room
0.5;and carried her to the 6th floor\Nroom directly above Okita-san's.
0.5;pretending to have had\Na hard time preparing the tea.
0.5;He had the sound of the\Nphone next door attract our attention
0.5;so we would witness Isami-san\Nfalling onto the veranda.
0.5;that it looked like it had been\NOkita-san's veranda one floor below!
0.5;But that can't be right. Her body\Nreally was in Okita-san's apartment.
0.5;and shouted and pounded on\Nthe door, but without reply, of course.
0.5;That's because it wasn't Okita-san's\Napartment, but Hijikata-san's.
0.5;All the rooms on the 6th floor\Nbelong to Hijikata-san, actually.
0.5;Afterward, while I went\Ndownstairs to get the spare key,
0.5;and used the\Nrope he had prepared
0.5;to lower Isami-san to\NOkita-san's veranda below.
0.5;He probably wrapped\Nthe rope under her arms,
0.5;lifted her over, lowered her down,\Nswung her onto the veranda,
0.5;As proof, her body has a scrape\Nmark from when he pulled the rope.
0.5;It was a dangerous and\Nunreliable method,
0.5;but the veranda faces the river,\Nso the chance of being seen was slim,
0.5;plus, even if he\Naccidentally dropped her,
0.5;he could explain it away by\Nsaying the killer threw her over
0.5;Hijikata-san put the 6th floor\Nroom number plate back to normal,
0.5;hurried to Okita-san's door\None floor below,
0.5;and then nonchalantly waited\Nfor me to bring the spare key.
0.5;As if he had been\Nwaiting there the entire time.
0.5;But could he really lower the body,\Nreplace the plate, and all that
0.5;You could easily buy that much\Ntime by stopping the elevator above.
0.5;Hijikata-san probably did many\Ntest runs to figure out the timing.
0.5;But, Mori-kun! You took the elevator\Nwhen he first brought you here!
0.5;Why didn't you realize\Nyou were on the 6th floor?
0.5;The floor number display\Nwould've made it obvious right away!
0.5;Yes. From the moment\NI got on the elevator,
0.5;Hijikata-san's spell\Nwas already at work on me.
0.5;Here, Inspector. Have a look\Nat the elevator's floor number display.
0.5;Signs of the trick he used to\Nlead me to his place of deception!
0.5;It's most likely black marker\Nink that he failed to wipe away!
0.5;He marked out the\Nvertical line on the lower left
0.5;"Hold on, Mori-kun!\NThen what about ""2""?!"
0.5;If it's as you say, then that'd\Nmake the number 2 look strange!
0.5;He gave us his business\Ncard inside the elevator,
0.5;I see! That would\Ndirect your eyes to the cards,
0.5;and hide the floor buttons\Nand display from view...
0.5;He probably wiped the ink off\Nwhen he stopped the elevator.
0.5;"My only chance to see the strange\N""2"" was when I went downstairs,"
0.5;but I was in a hurry\Nand there was no time for that.
0.5;"You've been saying,\N""trick this, deception that,"""
0.5;Proof that I took you to\Nthe 6th floor instead of the 5th?
0.5;But how do you explain that\Nthe living rooms on both floors
0.5;Before you accuse, could we\Nsee this infallible proof of yours?
0.5;Your confidence must mean\Nthat you wiped away our fingerprints
0.5;from everything we might've\Ntouched in the 6th floor room!
0.5;I would surmise you wiped\Nthem away while I was downstairs,
0.5;and when you hurriedly took away\Nthe teacups in the 6th floor room.
0.5;The fact that Detective Takagi was\Nable to enter the 6th floor room easily
0.5;means he made the grave blunder\Nof forgetting to lock the door.
0.5;Ask if there's anything odd on the\Nfloor of the 6th floor living room.
0.5;Takagi-kun! Is there anything\Nunusual on the floor?
0.5;There is something!\NA metallic, pointed thing.
0.5;In that case, please flip over\Nthe cushions of the nearby sofa.
0.5;Something I quickly\Nhid should be there,
0.5;I-Inspector! A model gun!\NThere's a model gun under the cushion!
0.5;Mori-kun! You're certain your\Nfingerprints are on this model gun?!
0.5;Because I broke it while waiting\Nfor Hijikata-san in the living room.
0.5;I didn't have the courage to tell him,\Nso I hid it under the cushion.
0.5;Never did I imagine it would\Nbe the key to breaking the spell
0.5;I was with you in Okita-san's room\Nthe entire time after the murder,
0.5;and I was with Inspector Megure\Nwhen I came down here.
0.5;In other words, unless I'd been\Nin that 6th floor room from the start...
0.5;...I wouldn't have been\Nable to touch that model gun.
0.5;Incidentally, the trick to\Nmaking Isami-san fall over
0.5;was probably done by holding her\Nup with fishing line over a rail,
0.5;and the line would break or\Ncome undone when the time came.
0.5;Inspector. Please inspect the\Nroom directly above Okita-san's.
0.5;The mechanism I used to\Nmake Isami's body fall on its own.
0.5;Then you admit to killing her,\NHijikata-san?!
0.5;It was I, Hijikata Kozaburo,\Nwho murdered my wife Isami!
0.5;She had to pay for getting\Ntogether with this lowlife,
0.5;It was different from\Nwhat I heard on the veranda.
0.5;Though, the main cause of\Nyour downfall was probably that
0.5;you underestimated Mori-kun\Nand had him witness your trick.
0.5;Had I been able to completely\Nfool the great Mori-san,
0.5;I would've made a great detective\Nin my first modern drama role.
0.5;That's the great detective\NMori Kogoro for you!
0.5;Mori-san! How does it feel to have\Ncaught a historical drama actor?!
0.5;I guess I feel like\NToyama-no-Kin-san!
0.5;It's crazy, Dad! All the clocks\Nin the house are ringing!
0.5;Ran, the old man, and I came to Tottori \Nwhere we came across a robbery.
0.5;Shuko-san, bride of the local \Ndistinguished Kumado family,
0.5;was attacked by someone, and their \Nheirloom incense burner was stolen.
0.5;As the old man suspects one \Nof the family members did it,
0.5;for some reason, the stolen \Nincense burner was returned.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;The culprit knew the police would\Ncome if he stole something.
0.5;But because he was confident he could \Nblackmail you for money, he stole it anyway.
0.5;As I'd expose his identity if he held onto \Nthe treasure, he hurriedly returned it.
0.5;And only the members of the \NKumado family know I'm involved.
0.5;So you returned it because the \Ndetective scared you, Sister.
0.5;Now that this is back, it doesn't \Nmatter who the robber is.
0.5;I wonder why the robber \Nreturned the incense burner.
0.5;It'd be bad if he held onto it, \Nso he returned it in a hurry.
0.5;Then he could have thrown it \Naway instead of returning it.
0.5;How will we determine \Nwhich one of them did it?
0.5;We'll follow your theory and \Nthoroughly investigate their alibis.
0.5;There were limits to how \Nmuch we could investigate.
0.5;It's only a matter of time \Nbefore we see results.
0.5;I'll let them handle that while \NI investigate someone else.
0.5;Is there anyone who knows a \Nlot about Senda Naomi-san?
0.5;And all her family passed \Naway a long time ago.
0.5;She seemed to be deliberately \Nfabricating an alibi.
0.5;but I was wondering why she visited \Nthe house the day before the incident.
0.5;That unfortunate woman ran off \Nwith our money when she quit!
0.5;I once scolded her for gossiping \Nabout the family that employs her.
0.5;I saw her secretly meeting \Nwith a man on the sand dunes.
0.5;She puts on a virtuous face, but that \Ndoesn't stop that woman from doing it.
0.5;It happened two years ago, \Njust before she quit.
0.5;The problem is she was secretly meeting \Na man, and someone witnessed it.
0.5;Shuko-san would have no choice\Nbut to pay to keep her quiet.
0.5;But Shuko-san doesn't seem \Nto have that kind of money.
0.5;There are witnesses who say they saw them \Naround 1 PM when the incident occurred.
0.5;The head of the household Iwao-san, \Nthe eldest daughter Makie-san,
0.5;the eldest son Soichi-san, and \Neven the second son Junji-san.
0.5;and could have gotten the pendant \NSenda Naomi dropped the day before.
0.5;It seems I came to the same \Nconclusion as this kid.
0.5;Yeah, it was exactly at 12:00\Nwhen I made my first delivery.
0.5;Shuko-san was in a hurry to get \Nit, so I thought it was strange.
0.5;It's because she didn't want anyone else to \Nanswer and discover it was a re-delivery.
0.5;And that she was home alone, but \Ncouldn't receive the package at noon.
0.5;when Senda Naomi witnessed Shuko-san \Nsecretly meeting a man on the sand dunes.
0.5;Naomi-san began using that \Nto blackmail Shuko-san.
0.5;And each time Shuko-san \Ndesperately raised the money.
0.5;They plotted to work together to steal the \Nincense burner and blackmail the family.
0.5;After waiting for the family to leave, \NShuko-san hid the incense burner somewhere.
0.5;Then she let Senda Naomi \Nin through the back door,
0.5;They decided that she was attacked \Nby the robber around 1 PM,
0.5;and Senda Naomi fabricated \Nan alibi for that time.
0.5;It was to make us believe she was \Ntied up because a robber broke in.
0.5;The most important part\Nof this fake robbery
0.5;was not letting anyone know \Nthey were working together.
0.5;They made us believe they were \Nnot accomplices, but enemies.
0.5;But, mister, why did Shuko-san \Nreturn the incense burner?
0.5;If she wanted to make us \Nbelieve they were enemies...
0.5;It would be normal if she\Nasked for protection,
0.5;because there's no telling\Nwhat Naomi-san might do.
0.5;Once we make her face my reasoning, \Nwe'll know everything!
0.5;If the incense burner hadn't returned, my \Nfather wouldn't have let her go so easily.
0.5;Because she messed up this time, \Nshe's plotting her next scheme!
0.5;But if that's true, then Shuko-san wouldn't \Ntell her family she's going to meet Naomi-san.
0.5;where everything began two years\Nago that lead to this fake robbery.
0.5;What were you going to make \NShuko-san do this time?
0.5;She acquired 100,000 yen, \Nso she said she'd give it to you.
0.5;That's what Shuko-san said \Nwhen she invited you out.
0.5;Shuko-san invited Naomi-san out to \Nthe coast to fulfill her true goal.
0.5;Two years ago, why did you secretly \Nmeet with a man, Shuko-san?
0.5;If you hadn't done that, you \Nwouldn't have been blackmailed.
0.5;He's also the eldest son of \Na local distinguished family.
0.5;When we fell in love at first sight and \Ngot engaged, my parents were delighted.
0.5;But soon after our marriage, \NI realized it was a mistake.
0.5;I considered divorce, but when \NI thought of my parents...
0.5;Then one day, my high school classmate \NKotani-kun invited me out.
0.5;At the beginning of this month, \Nhe died in South Africa.
0.5;I may have considered it \Nif you had asked sooner.
0.5;When I learned that, I decided to \Ndream only of this child's future.
0.5;I'll pray from a distant country\Nthat you'll have a good child.
0.5;By any means necessary, my father-in-law \Nwould take my child from me.
0.5;You didn't want to be \Nseparated from your child.
0.5;The blackmail taking advantage \Nof that feeling began then.
0.5;But there were limits to how \Nmuch money you could raise.
0.5;In the first place, hush money \Nwas only a temporary solution.
0.5;That's why you came up with a way \Nto keep her eternally silent.
0.5;But there must have been something \Nthat made you make up your mind.
0.5;The doctor who suffered an unfortunate death \Nin South Africa at the beginning of the month,
0.5;Kotani Yasunobu-san, made his \Nsilent return home today.
0.5;When she learned his true identity, \NI feared I'd never be able to escape.
0.5;Then you came up with this fake robbery \Nas a way to get away with murder.
0.5;and blackmail the Kumado family \Nfor a large sum of money.
0.5;I promised to give her all \Nthe money if she'd let it go.
0.5;as long as they got the money together, \Nshe said she's steal it in the night.
0.5;you returned to Tottori to help her with \Nher plan and carried out the fake robbery.
0.5;You thought it was a plan to make it \Nseem like you weren't accomplices.
0.5;Shuko-san's aim was to lie about giving you \Nthe money, invite you out to the coast, and...
0.5;No matter how much I apologized, Naomi-san \Nwouldn't forgive me for the other day.
0.5;We, the police, know that\Nbetter than anyone.
0.5;You planned to murder Naomi-san and escape\Npunishment by claiming self-defense.
0.5;This fake robbery was planned \Nentirely for that purpose.
0.5;You mean I was called back to \NTottori just so I could be killed?
0.5;But to carry out this plan, \Nyou had to go out alone.
0.5;However, the head of the \Nhousehold wouldn't leave
0.5;amidst the tension caused by \Nthe missing incense burner.
0.5;And that's why you turned \Ndown our protection.
0.5;She wouldn't be able to move if \Na detective were following her.
0.5;She only planned it, but she \Ndidn't lay a finger on you!
0.5;We can't pretend the fake \Nrobbery didn't happen.
0.5;Because I stole their precious\Nheirloom incense burner,
0.5;And there's nothing a detective can \Ndo about another family's matters.
0.5;I'll make my brother Junji \Ntake over the Kumado family.
0.5;You, Kazuma, and I can start \Na new family together.
0.5;You may not have noticed, \Nbut I really do love you.
0.5;When I go to buy an eel lunch, he always \Nbuys an extra large seaweed lunch.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NPitfall of Fire Precautions!"""
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shooting comet!
0.5;Conan's logic works wonders on\Nhearts tired by modern society!
0.5;An unexpected\Nculprit beneath the mask!
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;in place of Professor Agasa, his friend,\Nand his friend's granddaughter.
0.5;Whoever determines the organizer's\Nidentity gets to stay for free
0.5;and receives floppy disks\Ncontaining a certain program.
0.5;But then Ebara-san-- dressed as\Nthe Night Baron-- fell to his death!
0.5;How did the killer leave after\Npushing Ebara-san off his veranda?
0.5;He then knocked out a karate\Nexpert guarding the body
0.5;and appeared before us\Nas the Night Baron!
0.5;Was that policeman\Nreally a karate expert?!
0.5;Come to think of it, he did\Ndodge all of Ran's kicks!
0.5;The only suspect capable\Nof reading her attacks is...
0.5;So that's why neither of\Nthem ran after the Night Baron!
0.5;What would Shinichi\Ndo in this situation?
0.5;Yeah. Like what if it\Nwas Professor Agasa?
0.5;"Yeah. I'd flat out say,\N""You did it!"""
0.5;I'd have tried my utmost to\Nprove that they didn't do it first...
0.5;Sorry, Satoru. If only I\Nhadn't recommended this tour...
0.5;It's okay. I came along\Nbecause I wanted to.
0.5;We have a lost item\Nfrom the victim's room.
0.5;There's something odd\Non the security lock.
0.5;First, you cut yourself\Nan appropriate length
0.5;and then fold it in two, leaving\Na few centimeters of the sticky part.
0.5;Then you align the lock perpendicularly,\Nplace the tape on it,
0.5;Pull it more, and... the tape comes\Noff and the evidence disappears.
0.5;I dunno... Don't these\Nrooms have auto-locks?
0.5;You can use a room key to see\Nif a room is locked or not,
0.5;and you can peel\Nthe tape off if need be!
0.5;But this tip would've been\Nin the killer's blind spot!
0.5;So he must not have noticed\Nthis tape left behind!
0.5;Say, wasn't the key lying with\Nhis clothes near the door?
0.5;After the killer took his key,\Ndressed him up, and threw him over,
0.5;he left the room and set the\Nsecurity lock using this trick!
0.5;Then, after double-checking the lock,\Nhe tossed the key into the room!
0.5;That would seal the room\Nand make it look like an accident!
0.5;So the issue now is in the\Nalibis of our six suspects!
0.5;Maeda-san, who was\Nwith Ran and Conan...
0.5;Konno-san, who was in his\Nroom reading his e-mail...
0.5;Kamijo-san, who was in\Nthe pub with Mori-san...
0.5;And Kaneshiro-san and Hayashi-san,\Nwho were in the outside restaurant.
0.5;She said she called\Nthe front desk at 10:00.
0.5;Yes, she did ask for a\Nwake-up call at 10:00.
0.5;I remember her call well. It was right\Nafter I heard people screaming.
0.5;The victim was in Room 2101.\NShe couldn't have done it...
0.5;But why did the killer do that?\NOr even steal the costume?
0.5;They were probably worried when\Nwe realized it was a murder!
0.5;Do you have records of\NKonno-san in Room 2002?
0.5;Yes. He used it from\N9:45 until 10:06.
0.5;But that doesn't mean\Nhe spoke with anyone!
0.5;Did she drug him\Nto create an alibi?
0.5;She went to the restroom,\Nbut returned five minutes later.
0.5;So she was here when\Nthe murder occurred?
0.5;Yes. She left when she\Nheard the commotion.
0.5;Yes. They rushed to the front of\Nthe crowd after hearing someone fell.
0.5;It's okay. We've narrowed\Nit down to two suspects now!
0.5;Maeda-san was with us in\Nthe observation lounge,
0.5;but he's the one who checked\Nthe time, so he could've lied.
0.5;And considering that the knocked-out\Nofficer was a karate expert,
0.5;After he left us, he met some\Nfans at the lounge entrance!
0.5;They even asked for the date\Nand time with his autographs!
0.5;Ah! So Maeda-san\Nwasn't the killer!
0.5;Then why didn't he mention\Nit when he was questioned?!
0.5;It's the pen I dropped.\NIt's leaking ink from the shock...
0.5;"Not surprising; it did fall from\NEbara-san's room on the 21st floor..."
0.5;That's odd. He fell off the same\Nveranda but hit the statue...
0.5;Was the wind blowing\Nwhen that person fell?
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nthere was a strong wind...
0.5;It constantly blows at\Nnight this time of the year.
0.5;From the left of that\Nstatue to the right.
0.5;I can't believe I didn't\Nrealize something this simple...
0.5;No question about it!\NThat person is the killer!
0.5;What?! The knocked-out\Nofficer was a karate expert?!
0.5;I will now begin my explanation!\NGather all the suspects here!
0.5;The detective wants you to do\Nthis stuff in the suspects' rooms.
0.5;Concerning your alibis for\Nwhen the victim fell at 10:00...
0.5;The alibis of Kaneshiro-san, Hayashi-san,\NSayama-san, and Kamijo-san
0.5;are Maeda-san, who was in\Nthe observation lounge,
0.5;but after murdering the victim,\Nthe killer stupidly stole the costume
0.5;and then ran into\NSayama-san and the others...
0.5;...unaware that the officer he\Nknocked out was a karate expert!
0.5;The only one capable of knocking\Nsuch a person out in one blow...
0.5;...is the former Japanese karate\Nchampion, Maeda Satoru-san--
0.5;He was with them\Nwhen it happened!
0.5;The killer is the\Nalibi-less Konno Shiro!
0.5;Don't be fooled by\Nhis looks, everyone!
0.5;Hide it as he may, this man\Nis actually a karate expert!
0.5;Hold on. This is the pose he\Ntakes when he starts analyzing.
0.5;Before I begin, please step away\Nfrom the statue and out of harm's way.
0.5;Dropped from each of the suspects' rooms,\Nwith their numbers on them.
0.5;This is from Ebara Tokio-san's room,\Nwhere the murder occurred!
0.5;It was also blowing when the\Nvictim fell. Correct, Miss?
0.5;Yes! I think it was blowing\Neven harder than it is now!
0.5;Moreover, he was wearing\Nan outfit with high air resistance.
0.5;I doubt he would've fallen\Nonto the statue directly below.
0.5;Even the blanket dropped from\NKaneshiro-san's room one floor below
0.5;We were fooled by the glove on the\Nveranda and the locked room trick!
0.5;Those weren't meant to simply\Nmake it look like an accident--
0.5;"Correct. The killer didn't\Nlock the room after the murder;"
0.5;Meaning the most suspect are...\Nthe blankets lying by the statue!
0.5;Room 2102's Kamijo-san,\NRoom 2002's Konno-san, and--
0.5;It's just coincidence! After all,\Neveryone else's are by the statue, too!
0.5;It's indeed a coincidence\Nthat it was pierced,
0.5;but it's no coincidence\Nthat it fell there!
0.5;Besides, the killer is neither\NKamijo-san nor Konno-san!
0.5;Their windows are off to\Nthe side of the victim's veranda.
0.5;Looking at the point of impact,\Nit would be instantly obvious
0.5;But Sayama-san's room is\Ndirectly below theirs!
0.5;Her room's blanket must've\Njust happened to land there--
0.5;One directly below the victim's\Nveranda where there's almost no wind!
0.5;The call she made to the\Nfront desk to create an alibi
0.5;conversely proves that she was\Nin the room at the time of the murder.
0.5;So it was you who did\Nthat to cover for me...
0.5;Maeda-san stole the Night Baron\Ncostume and ran into her
0.5;He did it of his own accord when\Nhe realized who the killer was.
0.5;Yes. Upon seeing the\Nnecktie's knot, for example.
0.5;It's unclear if that was the\Nkiller's own style or not,
0.5;but Maeda-san did find\Nsomething in his room.
0.5;Something that was floating\Nin the pool later...
0.5;He was likely convinced when\Nhe found it among the killer's things...
0.5;The wig was in the room because\NEbara-san and the Night Baron
0.5;So that's why he\Nrisked running into her
0.5;with the stolen costume\Nand the wig on!
0.5;The reason he kept quiet about\Nhaving people to vouch for his alibi
0.5;was because it would cause\Nproblems if he were caught.
0.5;He planned to take the fall in place\Nof Akiko-san if it came down to it!
0.5;Thanks to you,\Nmy perfect crime was ruined!
0.5;That's right, I did it!\NI killed him!
0.5;He hacked the 'Workshop' software\Nmy brother bet the company on!
0.5;Yes, it's the software Ebara\Nsold me three years ago!
0.5;Had I known it was stolen,\NI would've taken it off the market!
0.5;My brother jumped off the\Ncompany building before that!
0.5;I've lived to avenge\Nhim ever since...
0.5;...and then I came up\Nwith this Mystery Tour.
0.5;My lure was the infamous\N'Night Baron' virus.
0.5;He immediately took the bait...\Nunaware that it didn't exist...
0.5;Yes. After I drove Satoru off,\Nthe bait I used to lure Ebara
0.5;into our room was\Nonce again the virus.
0.5;once he got a whiff of\Nthe virus's location.
0.5;Then I put sleeping pills in his drink,\Nlocked his room as planned,
0.5;My only oversight was that you,\NMori Kogoro, would be on the tour!
0.5;But you didn't even blink\Nafter I pushed Conan-kun into the pool.
0.5;Satoru. This is the\Nkind of woman I am.
0.5;After that, Akiko-san slightly\Nnodded and got into the police car.
0.5;Maeda-san was taken into\Nanother car for police obstruction,
0.5;only the Princess Wind\Ncried sadly around us.
0.5;I figured I could check his notes\Nto find out who the Night Baron was.
0.5;It looks like they wanted\Nit for bad reasons, though.
0.5;I simply wished to punish\Nthe owner of the virus
0.5;That reminds me, I heard\Nyou scoured the entire hotel
0.5;Plus 'he' taught me\Nthat you can't ever give up...
0.5;You know who!\NThat wandering mystery geek!
0.5;It's for a special campaign,\Nbut it ended three days ago!
0.5;As proof, there aren't\Nany on your bottles.
0.5;As long as modern-day\Ncrimes involve people,
0.5;there are no\Nunsolvable mysteries!
0.5;The stage today\Nis a first-class hotel!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;"It's titled, ""Detective Kogoro\NMori's House of Reasoning!"""
0.5;The player encounters a dead\Nbody in a mysterious mansion,
0.5;and gets hints from Detective Mori\Nwho just happens to be there
0.5;That's practically the pattern\Nwith me every time...
0.5;But is it okay for\Ntheir guest to be like that?
0.5;This is what you get for\Ndrinking so much last night
0.5;Those are the codenames\Nfor the men in black
0.5;Almost everyone in\Nthe gaming industry is here!
0.5;"I planned ""Detective Kogoro\NMori's House of Reasoning!"""
0.5;Thanks to you, we've\Nproduced an amazing game!
0.5;You definitely excel\Nat your work, Nakajima.
0.5;Assuming you\Nreally did plan that game.
0.5;I shouldn't have told you\Nthat the game would do well
0.5;Three days later, your proposal\Njust happened to highlight that idea,
0.5;You're a genius at\Nstealing people's things!
0.5;But that was back\Nin college. It's in the past.
0.5;After all, you seem to be in trouble\Nwith the debt-collectors and all.
0.5;Here's the number\Ntag for your luggage!
0.5;We need to hurry to the\Nshow floor and get things ready!
0.5;The president will\Nyell at you if you're late!
0.5;All three of you\Nhave the same briefcase!
0.5;Yes. And it's not just\Nour briefcases--
0.5;...our necktie pins\Nand wristwatches too.
0.5;to give ordinary people an\Nimpression of our company.
0.5;But in actuality, the briefcases\Nare way too big and heavy.
0.5;but almost everyone in the\Ncompany has left them here.
0.5;The president's probably the\Nonly guy lugging one around!
0.5;Look, Conan-kun! \NOur tag number is 100 exactly!
0.5;Very few people\Ncan pull that move off!
0.5;So close! It really lights up\Nif you get over 250...
0.5;Wow! Have you\Never practiced anything?
0.5;A little boxing\Nduring my college days.
0.5;I don't know.\NI've never seen him before.
0.5;All three of you were in the\Nsame boxing club during college?
0.5;Until he quit\Nhalfway through, anyway.
0.5;But to think we would all\Nwind up in the same company...
0.5;That's the logo for\NNakajima-san's company.
0.5;He should have the company's\Nnecktie pin if he's an employee...
0.5;some tomato\Njuice for his hangover...
0.5;I stuck a hidden microphone\Nand transmitter onto his shoe sole!
0.5;That big man\Nwas wearing this shoe!
0.5;I had finally found\Na clue leading to them!
0.5;My guess is that the\Nexplosives were attached
0.5;Did any of you see\Nanybody suspicious?
0.5;He might have been\Nfrom western Japan...
0.5;The big man in black clothes\Nwe bumped into in the lobby!
0.5;How do you know he\Nwas from western Japan?
0.5;I heard his accent in the\Nbathroom right before he died:
0.5;He must've been\Ntalking about a restroom stall!
0.5;In that case, the explosives must\Nhave been set near the stall door.
0.5;I actually received a\Nstrange letter three days ago.
0.5;Why didn't you contact the\Npolice the minute you received this?!
0.5;I apologize. I thought it was\Nan ordinary harassment letter.
0.5;The key makes sense,\Nbut what's this round thing?
0.5;Come to think of it, that big\Nman had one of those briefcases.
0.5;He took it from the\Nbaggage counter, but...
0.5;What tremendous power!\NIt bent this piece of iron!
0.5;Why is it bent away\Nfrom the briefcase?!
0.5;If the explosion happened\Noutside the case,
0.5;This was no terrorist attack!\NIt was a murder!
0.5;Yes. The bomber is the\None who gave him the briefcase!
0.5;--the best place to make an\Nexchange without arousing suspicion
0.5;No, nobody else has claimed\Ntheir things except for that large man...
0.5;Which means that the other person\Nhasn't come to claim the other bag!
0.5;There still might be clues\Nleading to Gin and Vodka!
0.5;Let me go before\Nthe bomber gets away!
0.5;He's still not doing well,\Nso I'm holding his for him.
0.5;If I remember right,\Nthat man's tag number was--
0.5;Which means the\Nother person in the deal
0.5;cut in between\Nthe old man and Ran!
0.5;That big man exchanged tags,\Nand completed the deal.
0.5;And then the instant he opened\Nthe briefcase to check its contents...
0.5;If the goal was to\Nkill him from the very start,
0.5;If an incident happens\Nat your own trade show,
0.5;you could make yourself\Nsuspect if you're not careful.
0.5;And the fact that the key doesn't\Nmatch the briefcase bothers me.
0.5;Wait! Could I have\Nmade a really big mistake!
0.5;Looks like nobody\Nknew who that large man was...
0.5;Nope. And nobody saw\Nanybody suspicious, either.
0.5;Hey, you guys should\Ncheck your briefcases.
0.5;There's nothing\Nimportant inside, anyway.
0.5;Wait a minute! Could this be...\NNow I see! So that's how it was!
0.5;In the eyes of the killer,\Nthis was an unexpected murder!
0.5;please contact me at\Nthe police headquarters!
0.5;If they let everyone leave now,\Nwe'll never know who did it!
0.5;I have an idea who\Nthe bomber might be,
0.5;I'll have to use the\Nold man's voice and body
0.5;Don't worry,\NI have it here in my pocket.
0.5;Let's get our stuff\Nand go home already...
0.5;It was lint! There was some\Nlint on your bottom, so--
0.5;You really should put\Nyour leg down now...
0.5;You just helped\Nme realize something.
0.5;You can't let the\Npeople leave just yet.
0.5;There were never any\Nbombs planted in this hotel.
0.5;That bomb was planted\Nin that man's belongings
0.5;even though the\Nbomber is among them?
0.5;the person responsible\Nwill admit to doing it.
0.5;The contents of that briefcase\Nyou've been holding so importantly!
0.5;You idiot! Do you want\Nto look like the murderer?!
0.5;Because he thought the bomb\Nhe put in the briefcase would explode.
0.5;The briefcase emblem found\Nat the scene of the explosion
0.5;In other words, it received\Na shock from the inside.
0.5;Meaning that the bomb\Nwas inside the briefcase.
0.5;"""Huh? It won't open.\NIs this empty?"" he meant--"
0.5;And it was the briefcase's\Ncover that was empty.
0.5;The person the victim was making a\Ndeal with gave him the briefcase...
0.5;The deal was done by having everyone\Ntemporarily check their bags in
0.5;and then exchanging\Nnumber tags afterward.
0.5;I got ♪96 and my\Ndaughter Ran got ♪100.
0.5;But Ueda-san, Nakajima-san,\Nand Takeshita-san
0.5;Naturally, their tag numbers\Nwould have been 97, 98, and 99.
0.5;when Nakajima-san went\Nto claim his briefcase,
0.5;And then the tag of the large\Nman Conan overheard was--
0.5;when Nakajima-san and\NConan bumped into the man.
0.5;The instant he checked the\Ncontents while inside the restroom--
0.5;Takeshita-san had switched\Nthat briefcase in advance.
0.5;when you had Nakajima-san\Nplay that punching game.
0.5;But when Takeshita-san\Nchecked the briefcase bomb in,
0.5;so it was certain that\Nhe would be in the 90's too.
0.5;But Takeshita-san\Nhadn't gotten in line yet,
0.5;That's why Takeshita-san\Ncut in between me and Ran...
0.5;To ensure his tag number\Nwould be in the 90's,
0.5;is the one Nakajima-san was\Nsupposed to give the large man.
0.5;The key found at\Nthe scene of the explosion
0.5;And it was a Mantendo\Noriginal briefcase that exploded.
0.5;It should be obvious once\Nyou inspect all the briefcases
0.5;belonging to Mantendo\Nemployees here today
0.5;that Takeshita-san's\Nis the only one missing.
0.5;Because his briefcase\Nwas blown to pieces.
0.5;To think that explosion\Nwas from a bomb I set...
0.5;to make it look\Nlike an act of terrorism.
0.5;That's right!\NYou were supposed to die!
0.5;The manager of our boxing\Nteam during our college days.
0.5;Yoshimi had been very\Nclose friends with Takeshita
0.5;You narrowly avoided being\Nmurdered, Nakajima-san.
0.5;But what do you say we\Nmove on to the real issue here?
0.5;The man in black you\Nwere making a deal with...
0.5;their organization is going to\Ncome after you, no matter what.
0.5;I think your wisest choice\Nwould be to tell us everything
0.5;Hey, Mori-kun! What organization\Nare you talking about?!
0.5;According to police\Ninvestigation afterward,
0.5;the amount of explosives\Nused was incredible,
0.5;and the bar was\Ncompletely obliterated.
0.5;There was no way to tell\Nif anybody had been inside.
0.5;was that the men in black\Nwere attempting to purchase
0.5;a list of the world's top\Nprogrammers
0.5;that Nakajima-san had\Nsmuggled out of the company.
0.5;Just as the black\Nsmoke covers the sky...
0.5;...so too is the case\Nburied in darkness.
0.5;Hey, Mister!\NYour button's about to fall off!
0.5;This was neither\Nan accident nor a suicide!
0.5;That's it! Now I understand\NDr. Date's train trick!
0.5;You can disguise your face \Nand use a voice changer.
0.5;Propelled forward by the \Nyears spent together.
0.5;Charging full speed ahead \Nwithout slowing the pace.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;they're trying to capture \None of my close associates.
0.5;they came while you were out driving \Nand isolated from other FBI agents.
0.5;They knew you'd come to Raiha Pass since \Nyou were beginning to doubt my death.
0.5;The 200 meter straight is \Nafter the next right turn.
0.5;I'll keep the car's steering wheel and \Nspeed steady once we make the turn.
0.5;The car's shaking because \Nthe tire's losing air.
0.5;Most of the cars aren't \Nin any condition to drive.
0.5;Anything will do. If any of \Nthem still work, go after him!
0.5;If we let him escape, there's no \Ntelling where he'll disappear to next!
0.5;The owner of this house just won \Nan award and is about to make a speech.
0.5;Thank you. As you just \Nheard, I'm Kudo Yusaku.
0.5;The only reason I was able to win this \Naward is because of the director, staff,
0.5;and actors who turned a new scriptwriter's \Nscreenplay into a movie.
0.5;And we mustn't forget the man who \Ninspired “The Scarlet Investigator.”
0.5;Yes. Unfortunately, my wife's \Nobsessed with him right now.
0.5;B-But we can't pursue him \Nunder these circumstances.
0.5;Will you trade me that phone \Nfor the gun I just fired?
0.5;To make up for ruining your friends' \Ncars, I have a gift for you.
0.5;It's the gun Kusuda Rikumichi \Nused to shoot himself.
0.5;If you investigate how he acquired \Nit, you might find something.
0.5;I suspected you since you were \Npart of the Organization.
0.5;Not many names produce \Nthe nickname “Zero.”
0.5;raise your prestige, and get closer \Nto the heart of the organization.
0.5;Don't get distracted by what's in front \Nof you and pursue the wrong prey.
0.5;Why did you let a suspicious man \Nlike myself inside the house?
0.5;You seemed determined to talk \Nwhether I wanted to or not.
0.5;I did think you were a rather \Ntalkative deliveryman.
0.5;they are wolves trying to \Ntake a bite out of them.
0.5;For the most part I spoke using \Nthe voice changer in this mask.
0.5;When I was told to remove it or faced \Ntough questions, I coughed twice,
0.5;and you answered through the speaker \Nembedded inside the device.
0.5;With all the coughing, he couldn't \Nhave told the difference.
0.5;I think I deserve the Best \NSupporting Actor award.
0.5;Though the woman working onscreen right\Nnow is probably most deserving of the award.
0.5;These elevator shoes are killing my feet, \Nand the voice changer makes my neck itch.
0.5;After doing my disguise, she took a flight \Nto the Macademy Award ceremony to play me.
0.5;Yeah. She's good at disguising \Nherself as family.
0.5;The Haibara disguise she did \Nfor me wasn't bad, either.
0.5;Is the FBI agent I stood \Nin for coming back here?
0.5;I won't need to come every \Nweek to check on you anymore.
0.5;Though I'm disappointed to lose \Nmy excuse to come see you.
0.5;But otherwise you look \Nlike a different person.
0.5;But when I use this choker voice \Nchanger, I become Okiya Subaru.
0.5;It's thanks to Professor Agasa, who made this\Nvoice changer, the disguises of Yukiko-san,
0.5;and Edogawa Conan-kun, the boy \Nwho came up with this plan.
0.5;Akai-san was looking for an inconspicuous \Napartment, but it happened to burn down.
0.5;Onee-san's home since no \None's living here anyway.
0.5;Wouldn't your son Kudo Shinichi-kun be \Nshocked to find a stranger living here?
0.5;I'd better call Jodie-kun \Nand set up our own plan.
0.5;To fool your enemies, you \Nmust first fool your friends.
0.5;If you'd told them I was alive, \Nthey would've found out.
0.5;Though I did take a bit of a gamble \Nso he could realize our situation.
0.5;But just like the kid predicted, \Nhe came with his real allies.
0.5;It looks like his hatred for me \Nis rooted deeper than I thought.
0.5;You mean what you mentioned \Nto Bourbon over the phone?
0.5;We came to have Subaru-san \Nsolve a mystery for us.
0.5;I save money on food, and \Nit's a good change of pace.
0.5;First the professor poured warm tea \Ninto four stainless steel mugs.
0.5;On three out of four paper coasters, he \Ndrew skulls with a black ball point pen.
0.5;and placed a cup of tea with lemon \Njuice on the coaster without a skull.
0.5;On the other three coasters, he put \Ncups of tea with vinegar in them.
0.5;Then the professor said \Nhe gained psychic powers,
0.5;and he'd find the cup without vinegar \Nwithout smelling any of them.
0.5;He picked up a cup and \Nhappily gulped the tea down.
0.5;Yes, along with their coasters while \Nthe professor had his back turned.
0.5;But he didn't do anything to \Nthem after drawing the skulls.
0.5;Let's ask the members of the United \NState's Bureau to solve this mystery.
0.5;But if something comes up, \NI'd appreciate your help.
0.5;After all, I'm one of a few \Npeople who know your secret.
0.5;I'm sure the members of the Organization \Nwould be shocked to learn you're the boss'—
0.5;Keep talking, and I'll blow your \Nbrains all over the windshield.
0.5;Didn't the FBI suspect you after \Nyou picked a fight with them?
0.5;Without any proof, there's \Nnothing they can do to me.
0.5;Going forward, you should probably \Navoid acting out of line.
0.5;Gin seemed concerned about \Nrats in the Organization.
0.5;Hondo, the FBI's Akai, \Nand that man makes three.
0.5;You know, the secret police agent who \Nwas erased before we got his name.
0.5;Since you prefer whiskey, I thought \Nyou liked scotch as much as bourbon.
0.5;Speaking of bourbon, did he really mean \Nto turn you over to the Organization?
0.5;He probably thought I wouldn't \Ntalk with you as hostages.
0.5;Yeah. The professor drew the skulls \Nwith an erasable pen, right?
0.5;The frictional heat generated by rubbing \Nthe ink with rubber makes it disappear.
0.5;the heat from the tea made \Nall three skulls disappear.
0.5;But the remaining three \Ncups of tea tasted weird.
0.5;There was vinegar in all \Nfour cups from the start.
0.5;Once you know how a trick works, \Nthat's what most of them are.
0.5;Why did you have us check if anyone \Nwas following us and come here?
0.5;Surely you didn't just want to show \Nus your improved talent for disguises.
0.5;This morning I received a message \Nfrom Kir, Mizunashi Rena.
0.5;When I was in the Organization, I \Nheard the name a couple of times.
0.5;Since she sent only one word, it \Nwas probably an urgent message.
0.5;In any case, tell James \Nsomeone big is on the move.
0.5;The next episode of Conan is \N“Welcome to Club Orihime!”
0.5;We haven't seen each other in \Nforever, and you're being mean.
0.5;It's the meatballs and cabbage stewed in \Nmilk and tomato we're serving this morning.
0.5;Huh? Has there always \Nbeen a refrigerator here?
0.5;It takes forever to boil water \Nfirst thing in the morning.
0.5;If I turn this on with my \Nphone when I leave the house,
0.5;They're electrical appliances \Nthat can connect to the internet.
0.5;There was nothing wrong when \Nyou made them last night.
0.5;Amuro-san's new special cakes face \Ntrouble first thing in the morning!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Why are we having cake \Nfirst thing in the morning?
0.5;we can't serve these to \Nour regular customers.
0.5;If it happened twice, \Nit could happen a third time.
0.5;Unless we can figure out \Nwhy this is happening.
0.5;We should come up with \Nsome way to solve this.
0.5;Yes, we're at the professor's \Nhouse right now.
0.5;It's not fair that you're the \Nonly one who gets cake, Conan.
0.5;I examined the refrigerator, and \Nthere's nothing wrong with it.
0.5;Dough that uses a lot of eggs \Nis typically this color.
0.5;And if you apply the same amount \Nof cream in the same way,
0.5;So they can't sell their cakes \Nsince they taste better?
0.5;Do you not care if you never get \Nto eat Amuro-niichan's cake again?
0.5;That can't happen! We have \Nto catch the culprit!
0.5;Azusa-san, can we set up \Na camera here tonight?
0.5;Yeah, from closing time \Nyesterday to this morning.
0.5;You look into anything \Nthat makes you curious.
0.5;Actually, it's because \Nthose kids who are excited
0.5;So you'll investigate anything \Nfor the people important to you.
0.5;So, did you find anything after \Nwatching the store all night?
0.5;I set up a camera watching Poirot \Nfor three days after that.
0.5;The first time was 11 seconds \Nat 1 AM on the 21st.
0.5;during the time we couldn't \Nsee inside the store.
0.5;The culprit came in during that \Ntime and melted the cakes.
0.5;It always passes by when we can't \Nsee inside the other stores, too.
0.5;Yeah, but cars pass by even on \Ndays when the cakes don't melt.
0.5;I'll ask the professor \Nto make it easier to see.
0.5;do you mean the professor \Nwho makes all kinds
0.5;The same taxi passes by when we \Ncan't see the interior of the store?
0.5;There was nothing wrong when \Nyou made them last night.
0.5;I examined the refrigerator, and \Nthere's nothing wrong with it.
0.5;I know. I'm Mori, the person \Nwho hired this taxi.
0.5;But the culprit who melted \NPoirot's cakes is...
0.5;The cakes melted when we \Ncouldn't see inside the store.
0.5;This kettle expels steam \Nwhen the water boils, right?
0.5;And this electric kettle \Nis an IoT appliance, right?
0.5;She was turning the kettle on \Nusing her phone during the night.
0.5;That makes it possible to melt the \Ncakes without being in the store.
0.5;Yeah. We talked to the \Ntaxi driver of that car.
0.5;Every night after midnight, \Nhe naps near Poirot.
0.5;The window fogged up by the \Nsteam from the electric kettle
0.5;In other words, it matched \Nthe days the cakes melted.
0.5;The kettle's electrical circuits were \Nbeing activated by the taxi's radio.
0.5;and the on/off switch of the \Nkettle happened to match.
0.5;It's what happened to the drone that \Nflew on its own at the professor's.
0.5;You were talking to me \Nwith your badge, remember?
0.5;Our badges were causing radio-frequency \Ninterference with the drone.
0.5;We'd better tell the professor to \Nchange the frequency of his drone.
0.5;And that radio-frequency interference \Nwas causing the cakes to melt.
0.5;That makes the cakes melt, and \Nthen they're chilled that way.
0.5;Does this mean we can eat \NAmuro-san's cake again?
0.5;It's a half-baked cake that's \Nmelted from the start.
0.5;Then you don't have to \Nworry about them melting.
0.5;I just have to add the cream and fruit \Nbefore serving them to customers.
0.5;And now you can tell them apart from \Nthe cakes from that other bakery.
0.5;Amuro-san, you were thinking \Nof recipes for cakes
0.5;that couldn't melt instead of \Nwhy the cakes were melting?
0.5;I hope you're doing your job \Nas a public security officer.
0.5;Who said he didn't want cake \Nfirst thing in the morning?
0.5;Maybe that's why they taste even \Nmore strongly of eggs than before.
0.5;Putting it in the cream makes \Nit taste better with fruit.
0.5;You can have bites of just \Ndough or just cream and fruit.
0.5;It's fun how you can eat \Nit in all kinds of ways.
0.5;Those roads are going to be \Nclosed the day of the summit.
0.5;Which means Amuro-san will be \Ninvolved in the summit's security?
0.5;You're not neglecting your \Npublic safety duties.
0.5;who was enjoying baking \Ncakes over solving cases,
0.5;Is this really where your friend \Nwas stabbed in the chest and died?
0.5;Tabata must've done it while \Nbringing Mifuyu-san's body here.
0.5;Our movie's such a hit, \Nthe frogs are croaking!
0.5;"Detective Conan Episode \N999 ""Troublesome Kindness"""
0.5;While heading home the other day, I saw \Na strange man in front of my house.
0.5;You're calling me suspicious? \NThat's ridiculous.
0.5;I came to check on my coworker \Nwho lives in this apartment,
0.5;but I forgot his room \Nnumber, so I texted him.
0.5;You're the guy who should've \Nminded his own business!
0.5;You sure do love to meddle \Nin other people's business.
0.5;Besides, it's his fault \Nfor behaving suspiciously.
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;By the way, something else \Nhappened to me the other day.
0.5;He was standing in front of the ATM without \Nusing it while talking on the phone.
0.5;My mother called me. It has \Nnothing to do with this.
0.5;Guys like him don't get it until \Nsomething that drastic happens to them.
0.5;I'll keep living my life \Nin service of others...
0.5;Kusano was taking a while \Nto return, so I came here.
0.5;Kusano-san was struck on both \Nthe front and back of the head.
0.5;The weapon is the deck \Nbrush next to the body.
0.5;For some reason, there's a roll of toilet \Npaper stuck inside the hand drier.
0.5;Your coworker Kusano-san was spending \Na long time in the bathroom,
0.5;I left the restaurant and was \Nheading towards the bathroom
0.5;when I nearly ran into a man \Nwearing a cap low over his eyes.
0.5;I ignored him and stopped \Nin front of the bathroom.
0.5;I heard the hand drier \Nrunning inside the bathroom,
0.5;so I thought Kusano would be coming \Nout right away and waited for a while,
0.5;That man who passed by \Nme must be the culprit.
0.5;Immediately after that, you heard \NYamanashi-san's voice and came here, right?
0.5;Yeah. When we arrived, \NYamanashi-san was sitting here.
0.5;I checked Kusano-san's pulse, \Nbut he was already dead.
0.5;Mori-san, you didn't see the \Nman in the cap, did you?
0.5;We've started an emergency search for him \Nand are gathering information in the area.
0.5;Since his wallet is still here, it looks \Nlike the motive was a grudge and not theft.
0.5;Most likely. That's how we're \Ninvestigating the case.
0.5;But what we don't understand concerns \Nthe elevator next to the bathroom.
0.5;Why did the culprit walk all the way to \Nthe stairs instead of using the elevator?
0.5;If someone found Kusano-san while \Nhe was waiting for the elevator,
0.5;But, Mori-kun, the culprit deliberately \Nactivated the hand drier before he fled.
0.5;would mean someone would \Nnotice something was off sooner.
0.5;In other words, didn't he do it so \Nthe body would be discovered quickly?
0.5;If the culprit bothered \Nto do that, that means...
0.5;If the culprit wanted to \Nhang around the bathroom,
0.5;blending in with the customers at the various \Nrestaurants on this floor would be the natural choice.
0.5;The culprit could've used the confusion cause \Nby the discovery of Kusano-san's body to flee.
0.5;So the man came here, attacked \NKusano-san, and left.
0.5;And it doesn't make sense \Nsince he couldn't have known
0.5;You don't know what you're \Ntalking about, kid.
0.5;Yes, Inspector. Now that you \Nmention it, you're right.
0.5;For the time being, we'll have to keep \Nall manner of possibilities in mind.
0.5;Did you retrieve the belongings \Nthat were in the drain?
0.5;How many times do I have to \Ntell you not to scamper around?
0.5;The culprit in this murder is the man \Nwho discovered the body, Yamanashi-san.
0.5;It's possible that this case couldn't have \Nbeen solved by anyone other than me,
0.5;In fact, one clue is \Ndisappearing as we speak.
0.5;In order to cover the sound \Nof Kusano-san's scream,
0.5;you attacked him the moment he put \Nhis hands inside the hand drier.
0.5;You believed the hand \Ndrier hadn't drowned out
0.5;so you hastily changed your plan \Nand decided you'd discover the body.
0.5;Kusano was taking a while \Nto return, so I came here.
0.5;It's a lie you made up to \Nconfuse the investigation.
0.5;How can you call someone \Na liar without any proof?
0.5;The first piece of evidence I mentioned \Nearlier is already disappearing.
0.5;probably because Kusano-san \Ngrabbed it when he woke up.
0.5;In other words, you haven't set \Nfoot inside the bathroom, correct?
0.5;Maybe you just thought \Nmy pant cuffs were wet.
0.5;Forensics recovered the button \Nfrom the bathroom drain earlier.
0.5;Did you retrieve the belongings \Nthat were in the drain?
0.5;Kusano-san's body was \Ncovering the bathroom drain.
0.5;If you haven't set foot inside the bathroom, \Nthen how did your button get in there?
0.5;Yes, because that button came off \Nduring your scuffle with Kusano-san.
0.5;My sister was coming home \Nlate from work one night
0.5;when she happened to witness a phantom \Nslasher stab someone to death.
0.5;but because of Kusano, the officers were \Nout patrolling for a suspicious person.
0.5;When I learned it was Kusano's \Nfault that my sister died,
0.5;He was always sticking his \Nnose where it didn't belong!
0.5;Despite the injustice you experienced, \Nwhat you did was still a crime.
0.5;There's someone here who \Nchose not to commit a crime,
0.5;Because of his meddling, \NI was fired from my job.
0.5;Lately I'd been keeping an eye on him \Nand had been rehearsing my own murder.
0.5;I'd planned to kill him using exactly \Nthe same method you deduced, Mori-san.
0.5;You made yourself stay in the \Nrestaurant. You controlled yourself.
0.5;I think I probably would've \Nattacked Kusano-san.
0.5;You've probably had plenty of \Nchances to kill him until now.
0.5;I believe you deliberately \Nchose not to commit a crime.
0.5;This is what that letter \Nwas warning us about.
0.5;Does this sheet music that was found \Nwith the body mean anything?
0.5;And what about the letter \Nwarning us about this case?

0.5;In that case, could you \Ncatch a culprit for us?
0.5;Three days ago, this was here when \NI arrived for work in the morning.
0.5;It's also on the office parking \Nlot, the wall of the warehouse,
0.5;will decide that if President Fukamachi \Nis unable to return to work,
0.5;but we haven't been able \Nto get in touch with him
0.5;since he heard about the \Naccident and came home.
0.5;In high school, he was suspended \Nfor writing similar graffiti.
0.5;He also caused an uproar by \Nusing fireworks to build a bomb.
0.5;He's gotten in trouble with the \Npolice more than a couple of times.
0.5;So he's threatening you so you \Nwon't become the company president?

0.5;He should be at the warehouse on \Nthe opposite side of the river.
0.5;It takes five minutes by \Nboat. I'll take you there.
0.5;He went to gather information \Nwith the secretary, Izumi-san,

0.5;Today, the director will be taking the \Npresident's car to the shareholders' meeting.
0.5;Could we keep what I'm about \Nto tell you between us?
0.5;The blocks are approximately \Ntwo meters apart.
0.5;If he just tripped on the block, \Nhe wouldn't have hit his head here.
0.5;It'd be impossible for him to hit \Nhis head here unless he was running.
0.5;But Fukamachi-san's knees were \Ninjured. He couldn't run.
0.5;In other words, you believe Director \NKiriyama pushed Fukamachi-senpai.

0.5;Inside the ambulance, the \Npresident was barely conscious.

0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;They're rare books. They're \Nworth at least that much.
0.5;because they're old and \Nunusual or limited editions.
0.5;For example, only 500 copies of \Nthis book were published in 1920.
0.5;There are currently many copies on the \Nmarket, but this one is in good condition.
0.5;But please get your husband's \Npermission to sell them.
0.5;Silverfish, written using the \Ncharacters for paper and fish.
0.5;They're bugs that like to eat the \Nglue in the binding of books.
0.5;With its silver scale-like skin and the way \Nit wiggles its body to move, it looks like...
0.5;Now that you mention it, \Nit does look like a fish.
0.5;Silverfish dislike the smell \Nof herbs, especially lavender.
0.5;Simply place a lavender-scented \Npiece of paper in the bookshelf,
0.5;but all together they'd \Nbe worth over 200,000 yen.
0.5;I can't accurately appraise them \Nwithout seeing them in person.
0.5;He's currently checking and mending \Nall the books he bought yesterday.
0.5;No. Apparently the husband asked \Nthat she not sell the rare books,
0.5;Dad, someone named Mizutani-san \Nis calling for you.
0.5;Start by telling me what happened \Nwhen the books were stolen.
0.5;the window was broken and \Nthe books were missing.
0.5;The police said it must've been a professional \Nbased on how the window was broken.
0.5;Those books were at our \Nhouse for nearly twenty years.
0.5;But the moment you appraised \Nthem, they were stolen.
0.5;Now, now. Let the police \Nhandle the investigation.
0.5;You came to get some books \Nappraised the other day.
0.5;I wasn't expecting to appraise \Nthem two days in a row.
0.5;What does it matter? Hurry \Nup and appraise them.
0.5;You stole these from Mizutani-san's \Nhouse, didn't you?
0.5;We came to the cafe next \Ndoor to get something.
0.5;A cerebral contusion caused \Nby a blow to the head.
0.5;The weapon is almost certainly this \Nbloody rock found at the crime scene.
0.5;Come to think of it, I heard \Nthose who work with books
0.5;But I think it had something \Nto do with those books.
0.5;I think there was a picture of \Nthese books on the victim's phone.
0.5;Yes. The first time he \Nonly showed me the photo.
0.5;I told him I couldn't appraise them \Nwithout seeing them in person.
0.5;Ayumi-chan gave him that notepaper at \NMizutani-san's house to combat silverfish.
0.5;I noticed the same thing and \Nsuspected he was the thief.
0.5;This afternoon, some rare books were \Nstolen from Mizutani-san's house.
0.5;So the victim stole the books \Nfrom Mizutani-san's house
0.5;Later, he called me to tell \Nme to come to the park.
0.5;The black stain in the photo \Nisn't on the actual book.
0.5;There were signs the victim \Nwas involved in a struggle.
0.5;We got into a bit of a tussle \Nwhen I tried to call the police.
0.5;and your hand cream matched \Nthe cream found on the weapon.
0.5;Tamaki Yujiro-san, could you come \Ndown to the station with us?
0.5;I know, but I haven't found \Nanything conclusive yet.
0.5;If he held the weapon with \Na hand coated in cream,
0.5;But forensics reported that there was \Ncream found on the bloody section.
0.5;In other words, the cream was applied \Nafter the victim was struck.
0.5;The real culprit is the other \Nperson involved in the book theft.
0.5;Take another look at the \Npicture on the victim's phone.
0.5;In other words, the black spot was caused \Nby a scratch or stain on the lens.
0.5;However, I didn't find a scratch \Non the victim's phone lens.
0.5;In other words, a different camera \Nwas used to take the photo.
0.5;I saw a photo with a similar dark \Nspot in Mizutani-san's home.
0.5;You're right. You mean the \Npictures of the flowers.
0.5;Mizutani-san, could we \Ntake a look at your phone?
0.5;It proves Mizutani-san sent \Nthe photo of the rare books
0.5;to the victim and instructed \Nhim to steal them.
0.5;To be precise, they aren't \Nher books, but her husband's.
0.5;At first, she tried to sell the \Nbooks while her husband
0.5;was in the hospital for \Nsome pocket money, but...
0.5;When you went to turn off the stove, the \Nsteam from the kettle hit your face.
0.5;as Yujiro-san's to the weapon \Nin order to frame him,
0.5;perhaps you accidentally got some of the \Ncream on one of your glasses lenses.
0.5;some blood should be \Nmixed in with the cream.
0.5;If you carefully examine Mizutani-san's \Nglasses, I'm sure you'll find
0.5;I planned to have Sawada sell the \Nbooks and give him a bit of the money.
0.5;But when he learned the \Ntrue value of the books,
0.5;Yes. Even if I paid him a fair share, \Nhe might continue to blackmail me.
0.5;Besides, if I paid him that much, \Nthat would leave less for me.
0.5;If he'd just bought the books, I \Nwouldn't have needed him to steal them.
0.5;So I deliberately hid that paper \Nin the books when I had Sawada
0.5;I did it so he'd immediately \Nrealize he was the thief.
0.5;I calculated that they \Nwould get into a fight.
0.5;Then I brought Sawada to the \Npark and had him make the call.
0.5;I killed Sawada before Tamaki-san arrived \Nand called the police when he found the body.
0.5;There aren't many of them, \Nso it's definitely rare.
0.5;Oh. It's a good book, but unfortunately, \NI can't assign a price to it.
0.5;But if you become famous in a few \Nyears, it'd be a different story.
0.5;I wouldn't have brought Conan-kun if \NI'd known it was this kind of place.
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “The \NUnsolved Cocktail Case, Part One!”
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na glittering shooting star!
0.5;Conan's logic is good medicine\Nfor hearts dried by modern society!
0.5;Today's point is evidence-finding!\NDon't overlook anything important!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;It was nice of my client to give\Nme free passes for solving his case,
0.5;Please, sir! Don't touch the art!\NAnd smoking is prohibited!
0.5;Okay! Here goes!\NCatch it, you guys!
0.5;Why are we playing baseball\Nand not soccer?!
0.5;Why do you always\Ndraw the same pictures?
0.5;Yes. His headaches occur\Nas his memory slowly returns.
0.5;So, he still doesn't\Nknow who he is...
0.5;Don't worry! We notified the police,\Nso we'll know soon enough!
0.5;I take it he didn't leave\Nthrough the front door.
0.5;It looks like he changed clothes\Nand took his things with him.
0.5;Did his memory return?!\NBut then why would he disappear?
0.5;He was strangled with\Nstring or something!
0.5;Inspector, he was strangled to death,\Nprobably sometime last evening.
0.5;What's the big idea?! Bugging\Nthe inspector again, are ya?!
0.5;No, no, Mori-kun.\NThese children discovered the body.
0.5;Perhaps the killer marked him\Nand mugged him when he was alone...
0.5;Yeah, right! Nobody'd ever steal\Nthat junk, it'd just weigh 'em down!
0.5;Besides, one of his\Nshoelaces is in a granny knot,
0.5;The ginkgo leaf in his shoe\Nis strange, too.
0.5;Judging from his location,\Nhe must've been killed somewhere
0.5;and tossed over the bridge\Nduring the night!
0.5;And why did he disappear\Nfrom the hospital?
0.5;Hey! I'll tolerate you getting\Nin my way, but not the Inspector's!
0.5;Now, then, Inspector.\NLet's have a look at the victim.
0.5;So, behind the house is a pylon\Non the right and a factory on the left...
0.5;It's not here, either!\NHow about you, Ayumi-chan?
0.5;There it is!\NIt even has a ginkgo tree!
0.5;Why does she want it so clean\Nthat there's not a single hair left?
0.5;She wants everything a\Nperson might touch wiped clean.
0.5;Don't tell me it's\Nto erase fingerprints...
0.5;The sofas and tables are\Ndifferent, and there's no tv.
0.5;It's completely different\Nfrom the pictures.
0.5;Say, Miss. Did you\Nremodel this room recently?
0.5;It arrived from the art gallery\Njust two days ago.
0.5;Incidentally,\Nwhat did you want to ask me?
0.5;Even that characteristic nose\Nis the same!
0.5;A person is normally presumed\Ndead after going missing for seven years,
0.5;but people in natural\Ndisasters or shipwrecks
0.5;Come to think of it, a rich\Nbanker by the name of Hayase
0.5;was caught in an avalanche\Nand went missing a year ago...
0.5;Back then, there were rumors that\Nhe embezzled huge sums of money.
0.5;so the authorities figured\Nit was a sham at first.
0.5;The embezzled money\Ncouldn't be tracked down,
0.5;But, it was eventually called\Na disaster disappearance?
0.5;Anyway, Conan. Have you\Ntold Inspector Megure?
0.5;Say, does the late Hayase-san\Nhave any relatives?
0.5;No. He had no relatives.\NWhy do you ask?
0.5;In other words, you're the\Nonly one who can verify his body?
0.5;Incidentally,\Ndid Mr. Hayase do paintings?
0.5;Yeah! We can check the\Nfingerprints on his old things!
0.5;He was painting in the mountains\Nwhen the avalanche struck.
0.5;The media and society\Nstarted to condemn me, too,
0.5;In the end, all we can\Ndo is take her word for it...
0.5;No! There's no doubt that\Nthe victim is Hayase Tatsuo-san!
0.5;There's gotta be\Nsome way to prove it!
0.5;Sorry! We left\Nsomething here last time!
0.5;Are there any traces\Nleft that the victim was here?!
0.5;If they're lying here, then they'd\Ncome inside if the window was open...
0.5;Wait a minute! The leaf,\Nthe window, the burn mark,
0.5;the glasses-less victim,\Nand the painting on the wall!
0.5;Proof that Hayase-san\Nreturned here with his memory intact!
0.5;Inspector Megure! The victim is\Nunquestionably Hayase Tatsuo-san!
0.5;I understand how you feel.\NMori-kun will explain...
0.5;Allow me to shed light on\Nthe truth behind this incident.
0.5;One year ago, Mr. Hayase went\Ninto the mountains to paint
0.5;He luckily survived,\Nbut lost his memory.
0.5;He then walked all over\Nas a wandering artist,
0.5;unconsciously drawing\Nhis house all the while.
0.5;A year passed, and he was judged\Nto have disappeared by disaster.
0.5;So, you couldn't\Nhave him showing up now!
0.5;Her inheritance likely included\Nthe missing money he had embezzled!
0.5;So, she killed Mr. Hayase when\Nhe returned yesterday, memory intact!
0.5;My husband died in\Nthe mountains a year ago.
0.5;You're right, I don't. That's because\Nyou disposed of all of his things.
0.5;But, the victim left behind\Na connection with you:
0.5;There were no gingko\Ntrees where he was found.
0.5;Yes, there's a gingko tree next to\Nmy house... and all over Tokyo, too!
0.5;One other thing, for some reason,\Nonly one of the victim's shoelaces
0.5;was in a granny knot...\Njust like your apron!
0.5;Probably, when you put his\Nshoes on after killing him,
0.5;Not wanting to be suspected,\Nyou decided to tie it.
0.5;Claiming I did it because\Nof a granny knot? Hilarious.
0.5;I'll have no more of these insults!\NI'll take you to court!
0.5;Are you sure about this, Mori-kun?\NYou have proof, I hope?!
0.5;Well, then, let me\Nget to the real point.
0.5;Now, Miss. Was Mr. Hayase\Na heavy smoker?
0.5;One got stuck to his foot\Nwhile he was inside the house.
0.5;But how do you know\Nhe was smoking there?
0.5;As there was no ashtray in\Nthe house, he put it out there.
0.5;I hope you're not going to make\Nme laugh by saying that's your proof.
0.5;Look at that painting the way\Nhe did at the Beika Art Museum.
0.5;Fingerprints? Are you saying\Nthere are some on that painting?
0.5;But you said she cleaned the\Nwhole place of fingerprints and hair!
0.5;No professional would\Nwipe down a bare painting.
0.5;But, if he had a habit of grabbing\Npaintings, she would've known!
0.5;After that, he started getting close\Nto paintings because of his poor vision.
0.5;And he formed a habit of\Ngrabbing them to get a good look.
0.5;When Mr. Hayase returned here\Nand looked at the painting,
0.5;his wife likely opened the\Nwindow to air out the smoke.
0.5;As her back was to him,\Nshe probably didn't notice this.
0.5;Miss. Can you explain why\Nyour husband's fingerprints
0.5;are on a picture you\Nput up two days ago?
0.5;Takagi-kun! Call the examiners!\NCheck for prints!
0.5;He did come here.\NIt's all as the detective said.
0.5;I killed him. I drugged his coffee\Nand strangled him with a rope.
0.5;Still, why did you dump him\Nin such a conspicuous spot?
0.5;He was finally classified as missing\Nand I got his embezzled money!
0.5;If people learned he\Nwas alive, amnesia or not,
0.5;Seriously! I suffered because\Nmy husband was an embezzler...
0.5;You'll have plenty of time.\NBehind bars, that is.
0.5;Way to go, Dad! You even\Nsolved the missing-persons case!
0.5;That lousy Shinichi'll never\Ncome back unless I look for him!
0.5;I refuse! He'll ruin my\Nreputation if he comes back!
0.5;Shiina-kun? What're you doing?\NWhat's with that car?
0.5;Come on, Shiina-kun!\NSay something, will ya?!
0.5;Darn it! A kidnapping\Nright before my eyes?!
0.5;"""The Popular Artist\NAbduction Case (Part 1)."""
0.5;That's right. She was originally \Na charismatic underground idol,
0.5;We should thank Kogoro-no-ojisan \Nfor making today happen.
0.5;I know. We were invited because he \Nwas hired to be Risa-san's bodyguard.
0.5;I'm glad she's gaining more \Nfans, but as her manager,
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;But the kidnappers mistakenly \Nabduct Ran-neechan.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;It must be a message\NRan-neechan left behind.
0.5;Is she trying to tell us they \Nmistook her for Risa-san?
0.5;There should've been two\Nmen and one woman.
0.5;So the kidnappers mistook Ran-san for \NRisa-san and kidnapped her instead?
0.5;The stage was pitch black, and \NRan-san was cosplaying as Risa.
0.5;At first, I thought Risa-chan \Nhad been kidnapped, too.
0.5;Inspector, it seems someone pulled the \Nfire alarm and turned off the breaker.
0.5;Yeah. They probably used it to \Nknock Ran-san out and kidnap her.
0.5;No, I'm Sakuta, a director \Nfor Beika Cable TV.
0.5;for about five years since \Nshe was an underground idol.
0.5;Could you submit this video to the \Npolice to aid in our investigation?
0.5;Sure, but I've already sent it to \Nanother TV station as news material.
0.5;We can't have you indiscreetly \Ntaking the story public.
0.5;They appeared to have fled in a red truck \Nalong the canal towards the clock tower.
0.5;Got it. Along the canal towards \Nthe clock tower, right?
0.5;The car carrying Ran-san is \Ntraveling towards the clock tower.
0.5;Be on the lookout for a red \Ntruck driving along the canal.
0.5;Inspector Megure, I left Conan at the \Nmotorboat the kidnappers abandoned.
0.5;The kidnappers were careless enough \Nto accidentally kidnap Ran.
0.5;They must have left some \Nkind of evidence behind.
0.5;the agency had been receiving\Nthreatening phone calls since last week.
0.5;Someone claiming to be a fan \Ndemanded that we free Risa,
0.5;and said they felt bad that we \Nmade her work for so little pay.
0.5;That if nothing changed, something \Nterrible would happen at the concert.
0.5;That sounds like they were \Npredicting today's incident.
0.5;Yes. Since Risa debuted \Nas an underground idol,
0.5;there's a man who has \Nattended all of her events.
0.5;there is that suspicious guy who comes \Nto all her photo and handshake events.
0.5;Someone appears to have been kidnapped\Nfrom idol-singer Risa Purple-san's concert.
0.5;We received this video of the concert \Njust after the kidnapping occurred.
0.5;I feel like I've seen that \Nman somewhere before.
0.5;He's the suspicious man who \Ncomes to all her events.
0.5;So the kidnapper was riding \Nin the car Mori-san took?
0.5;There should've been two\Nmen and one woman.
0.5;But this had fallen between \Nthe boat and the dock.
0.5;They probably dropped it while \Nthey were getting off the boat.
0.5;If he were just a witness who had \Nnothing to do with the kidnapping,
0.5;"but they must've carried her off the boat \Nafter only managing to write ""Risa."""
0.5;so the larger man must've trapped \NRan-neechan in there and hidden in the back.
0.5;I see. That's why her signal was \Nmoving towards the clock tower.
0.5;It's an emergency. I figured \Nout who the kidnapper is.
0.5;Ran-neechan was trapped inside \Nthe refrigerator in the back.
0.5;Damn! I can't believe I didn't realize Ran \Nand the kidnappers were riding with me!
0.5;Mori-san, we can use a GPS \Nto track Ran-san's location.
0.5;If we follow this trail, it \Nshould take us to their hideout.
0.5;He has only one employee, but he's 190 \Ncentimeters tall and likely his accomplice.
0.5;I figured out something \Nthat was bothering me.
0.5;was located in the hallway \Nbetween the stage and greenroom.
0.5;Normally the door is locked from the \Nhallway, preventing access from the stage.
0.5;In other words, the kidnappers \Ncouldn't have pulled the fire alarm.
0.5;When the fire alarm sounded, \Nwe were all onstage.
0.5;Even Risa-san and her manager and \NBianca were recorded by this camera.
0.5;Yes, you're right. One of the kidnappers \Nmust have pulled the fire alarm.
0.5;Did anyone go out into the hallway \Nbefore the concert began?
0.5;Now that you mention it, Yamane-san, \Nyou were gone for a while.
0.5;The kidnappers are crazy \Nfans of Risa Purple-san.
0.5;Mori-san, I received a \Ncall from the inspector.
0.5;The kidnapper is Takeyama \NTakichi, 43 years old.
0.5;The kidnapper was exchanging \Ne-mails with Risa Purple.
0.5;"""Please take me from the stage \Non the day of the concert?"""
0.5;"""Pull the fire alarm \Nand cause a commotion?"""
0.5;Does that mean Risa Purple planned this \Nkidnapping and had Takeyama carry it out?
0.5;Why would an idol work with a fan \Nto create this kind of commotion?
0.5;Because it would gain her the \Nattention of all of Japan.
0.5;This incident has been all \Nover TV and the internet.
0.5;Risa Purple's name has spread not just among \Nher fans but across the entire nation.
0.5;"""Risa-chan, we accidentally kidnapped \Nsome girl we don't recognize."""
0.5;If it was an accident, \Nthey should let her go!
0.5;"""We're taking the refrigerator \Nto the graveyard."""
0.5;I see. It's a graveyard \Nfor TVs and computers.
0.5;Since Ran has seen their faces, it's \Nhard to imagine they'll let her live.
0.5;the more capable they are of just about \Nanything when they feel cornered.
0.5;Though she doesn't tell her father anything, \NI'm sure she dreams of a happy future.
0.5;And you're trying to take that \Nfuture from her right now!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Kogoro's \NPursuit of Rage, Part Two!"""
0.5;Next time, the old man \Nand I will take them on!
0.5;It's the eleven-faced \NKannon inside this shrine.
0.5;or turns around entirely \Nwithout anyone touching it?
0.5;He beautifully dances his \Nmystery-solving steps!
0.5;A Buddha that turns around on \Nits own causes a strange case.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Even if something does happen, \NI'll be here this time.
0.5;Every day you go gallivanting \Naround instead of working.
0.5;And it's just the easy money you \Ncollected from your parishioners!
0.5;Junko-san, when we looked earlier, \NKannon-sama was turned around.
0.5;Oh, Dad. Dad, this is Detective \NMori-sensei from Tokyo.
0.5;He's investigating the \Neleven-faced Kannon for us.
0.5;It's nothing for a detective \Nto involve himself in.
0.5;Last year someone who went foraging for \Nwild vegetables was attacked by a bear.
0.5;They said there was nothing \Nfor it to eat since there
0.5;was still snow on the ground \Nwhen it woke up from hibernation.
0.5;Before that, just after a typhoon \Npassed and we thought we were safe,
0.5;Dad, why don't you stop \Ndrinking and eat something?
0.5;Yes. We were all together until \Nthe eight o'clock bell sounded.
0.5;We had forensics examine \Nthe front door and windows,
0.5;it is unlikely that the priest would've \Nquietly prayed until he was stabbed.
0.5;There's something stuck to \Nthat golden chandelier thing.
0.5;How many times do I have to tell you not \Nto interfere with a police investigation?
0.5;I wouldn't murder someone \Nover that paltry amount!
0.5;so I borrowed some of the money set \Naside to renovate the reception hall.
0.5;The tape was stuck to the \Nleft side of the canopy.
0.5;My mother feeds it, so it \Ncomes to the temple at night.
0.5;It lives in the bushes along the \Npath leading to the waterfall.
0.5;"was at ""Romance"" until \Nabout thirty minutes ago."
0.5;The tanuki was being fed \Nevery night by this bell tower.
0.5;This bell is equipped with \Nan automatic bell striker.
0.5;We heard the bell ring while \Nwe were in the dining room.
0.5;Maybe the tanuki found this \Nsalami here and took it to its den.
0.5;The killer placed the salami on this \Nside of the chain—in other words,
0.5;in the direction the hammer \Nmoves when the bell is struck—
0.5;Then they pulled the string through \Nthe window and into the temple.
0.5;Then they passed the \Nstring through the canopy
0.5;When the automatic bell striker \Npushed the hammer forward,
0.5;Then the tanuki took \Nthe salami to its den,
0.5;This method would allow anyone to kill \NEikyo-san without even being here.
0.5;But, Junko-san, the person\Nwho killed Eikyo-san...
0.5;Only someone who frequently \Nentered the temple
0.5;but when I considered all he'd \Ndone for me, I couldn't refuse.
0.5;because of all the bad things \Nhappening at the temple.
0.5;So I turned the Buddha \Ninside the shrine around,
0.5;Kogoro-no-ojisan asked me \Nto do something for him.
0.5;It's impossible to kill \Nsomeone using this trick.
0.5;Mister, is this white powder left \Nover from dusting for prints?
0.5;Junko-san, you can tell us \Nthe rest at the station.
0.5;Are you the one who's \Nbeen turning the Buddha?
0.5;It's true Junko-san attempted \Nto frighten Eikyo-san
0.5;In fact, it's impossible to \Nkill someone using that method.
0.5;Even if the knife hit him, it \Nwould only have injured him.
0.5;You saw Junko-san setting \Nup his trick, didn't you?
0.5;you and Conan were the only ones who ate \Nthe rice cakes covered in rice powder.
0.5;If the powder had been on the table before \Nhe started praying, he would have wiped it off.
0.5;He'd always yell when \Nthings didn't go his way.
0.5;We never discovered the secret \Nbehind the turning Kannon-sama.
0.5;The low frequency sound waves \Ngenerated by the waterfall
0.5;when the water level increased resonated \Nwith the air inside the shrine,
0.5;He should've come here and solved \Nthe case instead of calling.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan \Nis ""The Mechanical Witness!"""

0.5;So, what does the great \Ndetective want with us?

0.5;To thank you for riding, I'll show \Nyou the long route they took.
0.5;This is the intersection where I picked \Nup the strange brothers in sunglasses.
0.5;I turned left onto the one-way along the \Nconcrete embankment on the Teimuzu River.
0.5;We passed the park and drove \None, two, three, four,
0.5;After turning left onto the second road, \Nthere was a small coin-operated parking lot.

0.5;there was a faster and cheaper \Nroute we could have taken.
0.5;At first I thought they'd skipped out \Non their fare, but they paid me later.
0.5;Where did the brothers in \Nsunglasses go after getting off?
0.5;They climbed those stone \Nsteps down to the riverbank.
0.5;This must be the great detective Mori \NKogoro-dai-sensei's sleeping deduction!

0.5;I'm Imoto-kun's former boss and\Nthe one who introduced him to his wife.
0.5;I came to see him today\Nabout a business matter.
0.5;Terasawa. I live on\Nthe 5th floor of this building.
0.5;He used some dirty\Nlegal loophole to do it!
0.5;My guess is he did the same\Nsort of things to these people too!
0.5;As their matchmaker,\NI shouldn't be saying this,
0.5;but he and his wife were in\Nthe middle of getting divorced
0.5;I heard my husband constantly\Nrefused your requests for a loan
0.5;because your company was on\Nthe verge of going out of business!
0.5;So you couldn't\Nhandle it and killed him!
0.5;Is that main door the only way\Nin and out of this building?
0.5;And the only ones who\Nentered besides the victim...
0.5;...were his wife, Dobashi-san,\Nand Terasawa-san.
0.5;Moreover, each of you had a\Ndecent enough motive to kill the victim.
0.5;In other words, one of\Nyou three murdered him.
0.5;Please explain the situation\Nwhen you found the body.
0.5;It was a little after 5:00\Nwhen I arrived here.
0.5;More precisely,\Nit was just after 5:05.
0.5;I record when everyone\Nenters or leaves the building.
0.5;was to discuss the compensation\Nwith my husband one more time,
0.5;He and I have been living\Napart for quite a while now.
0.5;my husband was practicing\NTai Chi on the veranda by himself.
0.5;My husband did it every\Nmorning and evening for his health.
0.5;He didn't notice\Nwhen I entered the room,
0.5;When I looked out the veranda\Nagain after using the bathroom...
0.5;So basically, your husband died\Nwhile you were in the bathroom?
0.5;Pardon my asking, but how\Nlong were you in the bathroom for?
0.5;Which means your husband\Ndied at approximately 5:08.
0.5;did you hear any\Nsounds or people talking?
0.5;I was to meet with Imoto-kun\Nat 5 o'clock, you see.
0.5;Just as his wife said,\Nthe reason I came here
0.5;It's pointless,\Nno matter how hard you try!
0.5;I have no desire\Nor reason to help you out!
0.5;It was then that I heard her scream\Nfrom the other side of the roof!
0.5;...Imoto-san was dead\Non the veranda, correct?
0.5;Around what time did\Nyou leave the building?
0.5;I believe it was\Na little before 5:00...
0.5;And he didn't\Nreturn until just after 5:12.
0.5;He came back from his golf\Npractice rather earlier than usual...
0.5;I've always been a\Nbit spur-of-the-moment!
0.5;You weren't in the building\Nwhen Imoto-san was killed,
0.5;The issue here is with\Nhis wife and Dobashi-san.
0.5;You said you found your husband's\Nbody after you left the bathroom,
0.5;but there's the possibility that\Nyou never went to the bathroom,
0.5;and that you killed your husband,\Npretended to find him,
0.5;after Imoto-san refused\Nto lend you money,
0.5;but there's a possibility\Nyou were actually in his office
0.5;All you can see from here\Nis a small part of the veranda.
0.5;It's also possible\Nthat when his wife came in,
0.5;you were on the\Nveranda or in his office,
0.5;killed the victim while\Nshe was in the bathroom,
0.5;I was already on the roof by\Nthe time she came in here!
0.5;She even said that only\NImoto-kun's shoes were by the door!
0.5;Or do you have proof that you\Nwere on the roof the whole time?!
0.5;It came from the\Narea around this veranda.
0.5;Hey, could that sound have been\Nsomething hitting the handrail?
0.5;It appears something\Nhit it from below...
0.5;But the other mark\Nwas made coming up...
0.5;But there's no question\Nthat someone hit it.
0.5;I probably didn't hear it\Nbecause I was in the bathroom.
0.5;Why would someone put\Na mark in a place like that?
0.5;but in my opinion none of\Nthem seem to be lying, either.
0.5;Just because Dobashi heard\Na sound from the handrail
0.5;that isn't proof that\Nhe was on the roof!
0.5;He or the victim\Nmight've made the sound
0.5;Besides, if the\Nkiller was someone else,
0.5;then flew off the exact\Nsame way they came!
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nthe spot where the bird fell--
0.5;Directly in front of the\Nmark on this handrail!
0.5;The location where\Nthe victim collapsed...
0.5;An abandoned building\Nacross the street?
0.5;My deductions\Ncan't possibly be wrong.
0.5;She's his wife,\Nwho lives separately from him.
0.5;He's the president\Nof an import company.
0.5;And he's the former owner\Nof a fishing goods store.
0.5;I'll be returning\Nto my apartment now...
0.5;I have to make the\Nold man realize it somehow!
0.5;Have you figured\Nanything out, Mori-kun?
0.5;In that case, you may\Nleave, Terasawa-san.
0.5;This is the spot where\Nthe victim collapsed.
0.5;The victim, the mark, that bird,\Nand that abandoned building!
0.5;I'll explain everything atop\Nthat abandoned building!
0.5;I don't see what this\Nhas to do with the murder...
0.5;Ma'am, Dobashi-san,\NTerasawa-san...
0.5;Have any of you\Never been here before?
0.5;You can see the victim's\Nveranda from here, can't you?
0.5;Yes, but what does that\Nhave to do with anything?
0.5;Have you ever heard\Nof surf casting, Inspector?
0.5;"It's a type of fishing that\Nuses a so-called ""spinning reel"""
0.5;to allow the fisher to cast the\Nline some dozens of meters out.
0.5;The killer used\Nthis technique from here
0.5;to hit the victim's head with a\Nweight as he stood on the veranda!
0.5;The left foot is in front\Nand with a lot of weight on it.
0.5;This was made when the killer\Nflung the pole in an overhand fashion.
0.5;When he was killed,\Nthe victim was performing Tai Chi,
0.5;which is known\Nfor its slow movements.
0.5;the killer swung the fishing\Npole when he turned away!
0.5;The killer didn't realize the weight\Nhad left a mark when it happened.
0.5;And there was one other\Nmiscalculation on the killer's part.
0.5;As the weight was being\Nreeled in, it hit a bird in mid-air.
0.5;The bird you picked up had\Nprobably received a concussion.
0.5;But Mori-kun, it's over\Nthirty meters to that veranda.
0.5;Could someone really cast a\Nweight that far with such precision?
0.5;Especially for someone\Nwho's good at surf casting.
0.5;should undoubtedly\Nmatch these footprints.
0.5;And if we look hard enough\Naround this abandoned building,
0.5;I know what this is!\NIt's a pole grip!
0.5;Sometimes after fishermen\Nconnect fishing rods together,
0.5;So to prevent their\Nhands from slipping,
0.5;they place rubber tubes or rubber\Nbands near where the rods connect,
0.5;and then pull the rods apart while\Ntwisting them in opposite directions!
0.5;I just happened to see it\Non a TV fishing show yesterday.
0.5;Come to think of it, they had their\Ngloves off when they used these.
0.5;Which means the killer's\Nfingerprints should be on it!
0.5;and said he was going to build\Na fashion building in its place!
0.5;I said I'd give up ownership\Nif he'd just spare the store, but...
0.5;There's no point in keeping\Nthis dinky store around.
0.5;What's so fun about\Ncatching fish, anyway?
0.5;What do you losers\Nsee in it at all?
0.5;He destroyed it\Nbefore my very eyes!
0.5;My opinion of you\Nkeeps getting better!
0.5;Cases like that are\Na piece of cake for me!
0.5;Let me go before\Nthe bomber gets away!
0.5;In the eyes of the killer,\Nthis was an unexpected murder!
0.5;Next episode the men in \Nblack make an appearance.

0.5;I'm taking you to the Metropolitan \NPolice Department.

0.5;You were born in the town \Nwe just passed through.

0.5;A friendship that transcends social \Nboundaries is born in this soulful masterpiece.
0.5;So, Someya, if you're hiding \Nsomething, we're connected now.
0.5;Missing are Someya Ryuta, twenty-eight\Nyears old, arrested for assault and battery.
0.5;The woman sitting over there \Nwhile you were fighting.
0.5;I'm sorry, but I've got a \Ncold and am not feeling well.
0.5;Are you sure it's not because \Nyou're afraid of that man?
0.5;Anyway, discovering why \NSomeya ran is a great find.
0.5;If he wants to hurt her, \Nhe's sure to turn up here.
0.5;There was a similar scene \Nin that movie, but...
0.5;The officer picked up the \Nkeys to my handcuffs.
0.5;They're at a drive-in on \Nthe prefecture border.
0.5;Local authorities sent us \Nthis security camera footage.
0.5;It's in the city, but they \Nhaven't found it yet.
0.5;I told you, there's nothing \NI can do like this.
0.5;Yeah. After threatening her not to tell \Nthe police, he's going to hurt her.
0.5;Where's the waiter who \NSomeya-san hit the other day?
0.5;If you're looking for Nashimoto-san, he's \Napparently at the abandoned Haido-cho factory.
0.5;Someya-san caused the incident because \Nhe was trying to protect her.
0.5;Someya-san ran to protect Chie-san \Nwhile still in handcuffs.
0.5;He broke his chains, \Nbut his soul wasn't stained.

0.5;The kidnapper warned you\Nnot to tell the police, I assume?
0.5;"It was all my fault; if only I hadn't\Nsuggested seeing a movie!"
0.5;Do you have any ideas about\Nwho the kidnapper may be?

0.5;that happened at a certain \Ncollege one year ago.
0.5;The police arrested the \Nprofessor's assistant,
0.5;Allegedly his motive was the professor \Nclaimed a paper he had written
0.5;was plagiarized from his own work \Nand threatened to ruin his career.
0.5;The suspect confessed to his crime, \Nand he was found guilty in court.
0.5;I don't think there was \Nany problem with the case.

0.5;The murder of the professor at \Nthat college isn't over yet.
0.5;There's no doubt that Ashida Hiroto, who's \Ncurrently serving time, was the murderer.
0.5;But my friend can't believe he'd \Nsteal another person's paper,
0.5;But ultimately, he offered no \Nother testimony at his trial,
0.5;After all, you're a hack who couldn't \Neven decipher the mystery message
0.5;By his irresponsible court-appointed \Nlawyer who quit his case!
0.5;And you're Mei-san, the younger \Nsister of Ashida Hiroto-san,
0.5;In other words, you're not \Ntalking about your friend.
0.5;I believe Tsukuba was your \Nmother's maiden name.
0.5;And you're studying criminal psychology \Nat an American university.
0.5;I remember now that I heard you've been \Nstudying abroad since two years ago.
0.5;The layered pages torn from the \NJapanese edition of Caseweek

0.5;First, as far as I know, she may \Nhave been appointed by the court,
0.5;but Kisaki-sensei would \Nnever step down from a case.
0.5;In order to plead extenuating circumstances, \Nit would have to be revealed in court.
0.5;Even after she was dismissed, \Nrather than moving on,

0.5;Kisaki-sensei, unless you \Nreveal his true motive now,
0.5;At first she only joined \Nthe staff of my event
0.5;She decided to use them to \Nconfront you more effectively.
0.5;So she tore pages from the \Nmagazine featuring an article
0.5;on her brother's case that she always \Ncarried with her and left a coded message,
0.5;all so she could use me to reveal the truth \Nabout the case and tell it to the world.
0.5;The plagiarism thought to be his motive \Nfor murder was actually the reverse.
0.5;It was the professor who stole \NMei-san's brother's paper.
0.5;the professor revealed the dark secret \Nbehind Mei-san's study abroad program.
0.5;Her recommendation had \Nbeen bought by her mother,
0.5;who had passed away the \Nprevious year from an illness.
0.5;She was just trying to \Ndo what was best for you.

0.5;invited Amagi Tatsuya-san out last night \Nso he could tell him to stop, but...
0.5;personally identifying \Nevidence at a crime scene?
0.5;Judging by his condition, \Nhe must've died last night.
0.5;He poisoned himself with \Nalcohol and pesticides.
0.5;It's probably the weapon used \Nto kill Amagi Tatsuya-san.
0.5;Bando Hikoichi-san seems to have \Nbeen a pleasant but unreliable man.
0.5;He was forced into becoming the \Nneighborhood association president.
0.5;Apparently more than half the neighborhood's \Nproperty belongs to the Bando family.
0.5;he couldn't have avoided \Ntalking to Amagi-san.
0.5;Apparently that woman, Ezaki Hiro-san, \Nwas pestering him the most.
0.5;he may have brought the awl \Nwith him for self-defense.
0.5;And the panicked Bando-san \Nended up stabbing him.
0.5;finally did something useful \Nfor the neighborhood.
0.5;How convenient that he \Nstabbed that awful nuisance.
0.5;I don't think that's what \Nhappened, detectives.
0.5;Bando-san wasn't that worried \Nabout Amagi-san either.
0.5;You're the great detective \NMori-san, aren't you?
0.5;who teaches Japanese \Nhistory at Haido College.
0.5;Yeah, I was hoping we'd \Nfind something valuable.
0.5;Is it possible for such a historic old \Nmansion not to have any treasures?
0.5;The neighborhood association has been \Npestering me about that nuisance.
0.5;So it's hard to imagine Bando-san \Nwent to talk to Amagi-san last night.
0.5;There was something strange about \Nthe lock on his front door.
0.5;Normally you'd lock it if \Nyou meant to kill yourself.
0.5;but it was mixed into the \Nalcohol in the bottle.
0.5;If he killed himself, he would've \Npoured it into a glass.
0.5;After all, I heard Amagi-san was \Nstabbed to death with an awl.
0.5;Does that mean someone like \Nthat can't use an awl?
0.5;This must all be the work \Nof the real culprit X.
0.5;In order to make it look like \NBando Hikoichi-san did it,
0.5;he murdered Bando-san and \Nmade it look like a suicide.
0.5;But they're not new, and \Nthere's only one volume each.
0.5;She probably only bought them when \Nher favorite authors were featured.
0.5;Our chief told me to bring \Nthis to you, Inspector.
0.5;It was found under the \Nsofa at the crime scene.
0.5;The housekeeper showed up, so \Nwe had her confirm what it was.
0.5;That doesn't belong to \Nthe master of the house.
0.5;the sofa when I went \Nhome yesterday evening.
0.5;then it must've been left by \Nsomeone who visited after dusk.
0.5;Chino-san and Bando-san met \Nat this café, didn't they?
0.5;It would mean he visited him again after \Ndusk when they met during the afternoon.
0.5;As I was leaving yesterday, \NI dropped some change.
0.5;Since his belongings were \Nfound at the crime scene,
0.5;and tried to make it look \Nlike Bando-san did it, right?
0.5;But Chino-sensei doesn't \Nlive in this neighborhood,
0.5;so it wasn't as though \NAmagi-san was bothering him.
0.5;In other words, Chino-sensei had \Nno motive to kill Amagi-san.
0.5;Bando Hikoichi-san was the person \NChino wanted to eliminate!
0.5;was pestering him to \Ntalk to Amagi Tatsuya-san.
0.5;to make Amagi-san's death \Nlook like a suicide...
0.5;What did he stand to gain \Nfrom killing his friend?
0.5;It would be a different story \Nif he had some kind of treasure.
0.5;While examining the storehouse, Chino \Nfound an unbelievable treasure.
0.5;He killed Bando-san so he \Ncould steal it from him.
0.5;Chino lied. Kanemitsu-san, \Nyou said it yourself.
0.5;Is it possible for such \Na historic old mansion
0.5;When you think of it that \Nway, it does make sense.
0.5;Was it Agatha Christie who \Nwrote the ABC Murders?
0.5;Are you saying Chino-san might \Nhave already been killed?!
0.5;It seems I'm the one who \Nwas speaking nonsense.
0.5;Could we ask you a few questions about \NAmagi-san and Bando-san's murders?
0.5;The last time I saw Bando was \Nat the café that afternoon.
0.5;In any case, there really wasn't a single \Ntreasure worth stealing in that storehouse.
0.5;It's possible you already stole the object \Nwhile you were examining the contents.
0.5;You were worried Bando-san would \Nnotice, so you killed him.
0.5;I was the president of the \Nmystery club during college,
0.5;so I'm contacted by various \Nmystery magazines.
0.5;Inspector, you think it's \Nstrange, too, don't you?
0.5;It's hard to imagine someone who \Nlikes mysteries making basic mistakes,
0.5;And he must know of all kinds \Nof ways to fabricate an alibi,
0.5;If someone else killed \NAmagi-san and Bando-san,
0.5;They would've made that \Ndeath look like a suicide.
0.5;It is strange that a murderer \Nwho killed two people
0.5;The fact that he's alive is definitive \Nproof that Chino Yosuke did it.
0.5;All that's left is for the police \Nto investigate and arrest him.
0.5;Fukuda-san and his family and \NEzaki Hiro-san and her friends.
0.5;The man who first discovered \NAmagi-san's body and the woman
0.5;who was most aggressively \Npestering Bando-san were there.
0.5;I know Bando had a fear of needles \Nand couldn't have used an awl.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The Shifting \NMystery of Beika City, Part Two!"""
0.5;Although smaller, my mind remains\Nthat of a sharp detective!
0.5;Today's case is a two-part story\Naboard a luxury liner!
0.5;Think you can tell who did it\Njust from Part 1?
0.5;He forgot what time\Nour return ship left,
0.5;so we got to ride on\Nthis big one instead!
0.5;We would've been stranded out\Nthere for 3 days if it hadn't.
0.5;But I wonder what kind of people\Nwould reserve a ship like this...
0.5;I was just thinking about my parents\Nwho died in an accident last year...
0.5;I wish they could've seen me\Nall dressed up today...
0.5;The majority of the island\Nbelongs to the Hatamoto family.
0.5;We honor generations\Nof our ancestors there.
0.5;It's a Hatamoto family tradition to\Nhold wedding ceremonies on the island.
0.5;We reserved this boat for ourselves,\Nso what are strangers doing on it?!
0.5;He's been in a bad mood\Nsince the ceremony today.
0.5;I knew he hated Western-style food,\Nbut I had no idea he'd get that angry.
0.5;Say, lady-killer...\NWhat's with the flower?
0.5;Oh, Natsue put it there on\Nthe way back from the ceremony.
0.5;It's always been my dream\Nsince I was a little girl
0.5;to give my beloved this flower\Nthat only grows on that island.
0.5;How long are you going to let\Nhim pretend to be an artist?!
0.5;You're his father,\Ntalk some sense into him!
0.5;I need a word with you!\NCome to my room later!
0.5;He isn't long for this world--\Nhe'll be gone soon enough.
0.5;And when he is, nearly all of the\NHatamoto fortune will be yours!
0.5;Akie-san! Do you know\Nsomething I don't?!
0.5;It sounds like Grandfather's\Ngoing to make the announcement
0.5;NDoes he even know we're up to\Nour necks in debt over here?!
0.5;We have 24 hours until\Nthe ship arrives in Tokyo.
0.5;We simply have to\Ndo something before then...
0.5;That was an exceptional speech\Nyou gave at the wedding.
0.5;Scratching your cheeks\Nwhen you're embarrassed...
0.5;Falsify your family registry all\Nyou want, you still cannot fool me!
0.5;I've known all this time\Nthat you joined the company
0.5;and got close to Natsue\Njust to avenge your father!
0.5;What's the matter?\NWhy won't you speak?!
0.5;These are the main members\Nof the Hatamoto family.
0.5;So all of these people\Nwent to your wedding?
0.5;excluding my late parents\NShoichi and Miyuki.
0.5;Yes. He still hasn't come\Nback from Grandfather's room...
0.5;I'll have you know\Nthere is someone I like!
0.5;Well, he's really smart, good at soccer,\Ndependable, and cool!
0.5;What are you acting\Nso embarrassed about?
0.5;And he's an even better\Ndetective than my dad!
0.5;Keep it a secret from my grandfather!\NHe hates detectives!
0.5;He says that people who pry\Ninto others' affairs are despicable!
0.5;He's right, at least\Nin old man Kogoro's case.
0.5;Sorry, I was thinking\Nabout some things in my room.
0.5;That's strange.\NWhere could I have lost it?
0.5;Nobody's to enter this room\Nuntil I say it's okay!
0.5;You were the one\Nwho found him, Suzuki-san?
0.5;Where were you 40 to 50 minutes ago,\Naround 8:00 PM?
0.5;I was getting things\Nready for dinner at 8:00,
0.5;so I was in the dining room\Nthe entire time.
0.5;I did see Suzuki-san working\Nin a hurry around the tables!
0.5;The door to this room was locked\Nwhen you found the body, correct?
0.5;but you need this key\Nto lock it from the outside.
0.5;And this window doesn't open, so it's\Nimpossible to sneak into the room.
0.5;In other words,\Nthis room was impregnable!
0.5;You're saying that my grandfather\Ncommitted suicide?!
0.5;He died of blood loss after\Nbeing stabbed in the abdomen.
0.5;But the knife used to do it\Nis nowhere to be found.
0.5;Are you sure it wasn't a dagger\Nmade of ice or anything?
0.5;Mystery novels are full of things\Nthat melt away and stuff.
0.5;Would someone seriously commit suicide\Nwith something like that?
0.5;He wanted to torment us by making\Nevery Hatamoto here seem suspect!
0.5;He hated everyone\Nin the family, after all.
0.5;Here, take a close look\Nat the doorframe!
0.5;If the door was closed\Nwhen he committed suicide,
0.5;none of his blood\Ncould have landed there.
0.5;So it's more natural to think that\Nhe was stabbed while the door was open.
0.5;That's it! Somebody stabbed Gozo\Nthe instant he left the room!
0.5;That's it! It was Mr. Gozo himself\Nwho locked the door!
0.5;Someone stabbed him outside the room\Nand then kept coming for him,
0.5;so he locked himself inside\Nto escape his attacker!
0.5;But then he ran\Nout of strength and died!
0.5;Wait a minute! That means everyone\Nhad an opportunity to kill him!
0.5;The murder took place\Nat approximately 8:00.
0.5;Ran, Conan, Natsue-san,\Nand I were at our table since 7:30,
0.5;The same can be said for Suzuki-san,\Nwho was near our table at the time.
0.5;In other words, since the killer\Nwasn't in the dining room at the time...
0.5;When you entered the room, did you\Nnotice anything out of the ordinary?
0.5;Oh, now that you mention it, I found\Nthis flower in front of the door...
0.5;That's the flower I put on\NTakeshi-san's jacket!
0.5;Come to think of it, you were really\Nlate coming to the dining room.
0.5;No, I was just thinking\Nabout things in my room...
0.5;I happened to hear you\Nand Father shouting in his room!
0.5;when I heard that you're\Nactually the son of Zaiki Isao!
0.5;He committed suicide when Gozo\Ntook over his company 10 years ago.
0.5;One year later,\Nhis wife died of an illness,
0.5;and their only son was apparently\Nplaced in an institution.
0.5;...Got close to Natsue-san\Nso you could avenge your father?
0.5;I had you pegged as\Na pretty staunch fellow,
0.5;You gotta be an idiot to drop\Nyour flower at the crime scene!
0.5;There are wiped blood stains\Non the outside carpet...
0.5;Say, was that flower\Nreally here on the floor?
0.5;A bread crumb lying\Nin a pool of blood?
0.5;Was there bread during the\Nwedding banquet this afternoon?
0.5;But of course--it was an\Nextravagant French meal.
0.5;Joji-sama made it all himself.\NHe runs his own French restaurant.
0.5;He said that just looking\Nat bread would make him nauseous.
0.5;If Joji-san's a chef, he has\Nkitchen knives of his own, right?
0.5;Naturally. Chefs like him\Nalways own their own set.
0.5;Come now, children shouldn't\Npry into other people's business.
0.5;His motive and all the evidence is\Nmore than enough, right, Detective?
0.5;And if his fingerprints are found\Non the murder weapon, it's in the bag.
0.5;Now that Takeshi-san\Nhas killed the old man,
0.5;he'll never make that stupid\Nannouncement about his inheritance!
0.5;Now the Hatamoto Group\Nwill belong to you,
0.5;now that your grandfather's dead,\NIchiro-san!
0.5;Hey, you ain't thinkin' of monopolizing\Nthe guy's inheritance, are ya?
0.5;Don't worry! All you\Ngrandchildren will get--
0.5;Could you not talk about money\Non the night of our father's death?
0.5;when you asked to borrow\Nmoney for your restaurant!
0.5;You wanted his money too!\NSo be grateful!
0.5;just in case something\Nwas to happen to him...
0.5;I believe it will be read at the\Nmain office in the next few days.
0.5;And leadership of the Hatamoto Group\Nis to be given to the man
0.5;What? Then what the hell\Ndid I marry Akie for?!
0.5;Don't tell me you only married me\Nto get my dad's money!
0.5;That's right! Why else would I live\Nwith a tight-fisted bitch like you?!
0.5;Who're you to talk?!\NYou're just a worthless musician!
0.5;But he only married me so\Nhe could kill my grandfather!
0.5;My gut feeling tells me\Nthat he's not a bad person.
0.5;Hey, did you hear\Nanything strange just now?
0.5;and then a weird thud\Nfrom the deck below!
0.5;The cause of death was\Nmost likely brain damage
0.5;the murder weapon was a\Nsteel pipe or something similar.
0.5;We most certainly locked him inside,\Nbut he's nowhere to be found.
0.5;So Takeshi was the one who\Nkilled Father and Tatsuo-san!
0.5;was either the sound of the murder weapon\Nbeing thrown overboard, or...
0.5;...the sound of the killer\Njumping into the water
0.5;At any rate, there's still\Na high possibility
0.5;Let's all withdraw to\Nthe dining room for now.
0.5;Are you saying he could\Nbe trying to kill me?!
0.5;His motive for murder was to\Nexact revenge on Hatamoto Gozo,
0.5;who drove his father\Nto suicide 10 years ago!
0.5;...he could be trying to kill\Neveryone in the Hatamoto family!
0.5;You're the one who wants\Nthe inheritance the most!
0.5;All of these mysteries\Nare connected by one thread!
0.5;As times change, difficult cases\Nwill increase in number!
0.5;Let's train both\Nour minds and bodies!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;After winning a raffle,\Nwe were invited to a sports gym
0.5;the day before its\Ngrand re-opening.
0.5;More like from the\Nneck down in your case...
0.5;These renovations have been\Nthe earnest wish of our sports club!
0.5;I really understand\Nthe greatness of sports!
0.5;So it was my hope to help others\Nget in shape and better their health...
0.5;Let's ditch my dad\Nand check out the pool!
0.5;You're up, Naruse!\NDon't mess up now!
0.5;I haven't gotten enough practice\Nwith all the preparations lately.
0.5;That the only reason you\Nhaven't practiced enough?
0.5;it's clear how the\Ntournament'll turn out.
0.5;Hey, Naruse!\NGet back to practice!
0.5;I think that's Kijima-san,\NSaijo-san's former rival...
0.5;so he switched to\Ncompetitive swimming...
0.5;Here we have our prized competitive\Nswimming and high-diving pool.
0.5;They're in the middle of\Nhigh-dive practice as we speak!
0.5;"Your look says,\N""What a pity he survived."""
0.5;the re-opening will\Nfail if even a rumor
0.5;We're having a job-well-done\Nparty in my office at 8:00!
0.5;Well, guess I'll get\Na little more practice in.
0.5;A hidden camera photo?\NThe man is that Naruse guy...
0.5;Oh, sorry. I always wear\Nearplugs during practice, you see.
0.5;You should work out instead\Nof smoking and drinking!
0.5;Yeah, that's about the only\Nthing you have going for you...
0.5;Oh! I have a call on\Nmy answering machine!
0.5;I hate to ask, but could you come\Nto the Saeki Sports Club right away?
0.5;One of the instructors,\NSaijo Naoya-san,
0.5;Sorry I'm late.\NSo, what do we have?
0.5;Just because you've\Nbeen in water before
0.5;After all, the body's condition\Npoints entirely to a drowning.
0.5;See the foam coming\Nfrom his nose and mouth?
0.5;And the slight bit\Nof blood from his ears.
0.5;They're both characteristics\Nof a drowning, right?
0.5;Eh? Oh, I think it was on a\Nsuspense TV show the other day...
0.5;Huh? Did he hit his\Nforehead on something?
0.5;Exactly. It seems he messed up\Nduring his high-diving practice.
0.5;I hear it's quite a\Ndangerous practice indeed...
0.5;I asked you here because you\Nsaw him practicing this afternoon,
0.5;Everyone else had finished\Npreparing for tomorrow
0.5;so Saijo-san practiced\Nwhenever he could.
0.5;We also have a witness.\NThere's no question about it.
0.5;Yes. An old man on the\Nsecond floor of those apartments
0.5;says he saw someone doing\Nhigh-dive practice all alone.
0.5;But he didn't see\Nthe accident itself, right?
0.5;Say, I think Saijo-san always\Nwore earplugs when practicing.
0.5;Yes, the examiners\Nremoved them earlier...
0.5;He had different\Nones this afternoon.
0.5;High-divers don't usually\Nwear caps, you know?
0.5;So? People can do\Ndifferent things sometimes!
0.5;Huh? No, it was unlocked...\NBut who're you, little boy?
0.5;You know, he's the kid staying\Nwith Detective Mori.
0.5;No question about it!\NThis was a murder!
0.5;Umm, this won't affect our\Nre-opening tomorrow, will it?
0.5;What happened to\NSaijo-kun was terrible,
0.5;We'll re-open\Ntomorrow as scheduled!
0.5;Just to be on the safe side,\Ndo your final checks--
0.5;It would be hard for\Nan outsider to get inside.
0.5;Therefore, it's highly likely that\Nthe killer was someone on the inside!
0.5;The job-well-done\Nparty was here, right?
0.5;In other words, it wouldn't\Nhave been impossible to sneak out.
0.5;Kijima Hisashi, who had\Nhis leadership position stolen...
0.5;Naruse Keiichi, blackmailed\Nwith adultery photos...
0.5;A detective told me\Nto come hear your story.
0.5;Did you paint this based\Non what you saw from here?!
0.5;Painting at a set time everyday\Nis an old man's excitement!
0.5;practicing intensely...\NHe brought it on himself.
0.5;Yes. His diving form made a silhouette\Nwith the full moon behind him.
0.5;So you didn't actually see\NSaijo-san's face tonight, then?!
0.5;That's right.\NIt was very beautiful...
0.5;The image came right to\Nme so I painted it right away.
0.5;This is! Ah, now I get it!\NThat person was the killer!
0.5;You're in trouble now!\NGet over here!
0.5;Are you all right?! Dad!\NConan-kun!
0.5;That's right. This was a murder\Nmade to look like an accident!
0.5;After knocking Saijo-san out\Nwith a chloroform-soaked rag,
0.5;Wait, was the cap\Nmeant to fool us about that?!
0.5;It was meant to make the poolside\Nmurder look like a diving accident.
0.5;The killer then threw the removed\Nclothes into Saijo-san's locker
0.5;at a set time every day,\Nthat changes things substantially.
0.5;"In short, the witness\Ndidn't coincidentally see it;"
0.5;If so, there'd be no need to turn\Noff the lights and create a silhouette.
0.5;That's it! He saw someone\Ncompletely different!
0.5;You used to be a diver,\Nbut switched to swimming.
0.5;Might you have hated Saijo-san\Nfor taking your role as team captain?
0.5;That's something only a\Ncompetitive swimmer would think of!
0.5;He killed Saijo-san and\Nmade it look like an accident!
0.5;You're going to accuse\Nme based on some guess?!
0.5;Never mind that he cut\Nthe lights to show off his diving,
0.5;there was other definitive\Nevidence that shone in the moonlight...
0.5;The old man painted\Nthat faithfully to what he saw...
0.5;if the killer was an insider,\Nhe hasn't left yet!
0.5;Which means the murder weapon\Nmust be in this building somewhere.
0.5;But why would he murder him\Nover the role as team captain?
0.5;and severely injured my girlfriend\Nwho was sitting behind me.
0.5;but he threatened to tell the owner\Nand the tournament committee!
0.5;So I used my health as a reason to\Ngive him my place as captain!
0.5;It seems your mistake was\Nmaking too perfect of a dive.
0.5;It was a once-in-a-lifetime\Nperformance for me.
0.5;but I just couldn't\Nlose my balance during it!
0.5;A concrete block was later\Nfound in an office trash can.
0.5;Upon examination, it matched\Nwith Saijo-san's forehead injury,
0.5;and Kijima's fingerprints\Nwere found on it.
0.5;That's it! I figured out\Nthe locked room trick! And--
0.5;I'm a famous high school detective\Nknown throughout the country!
0.5;But I was forced to take a pill\Nby some organization...
0.5;My mind's that of a brilliant\N17-year-old detective!
0.5;I can solve cases that not\Neven adults can handle!
0.5;A Murder Behind the Locked\NDoors of a Celebrity's Apartment.
0.5;There still hasn't been any\Ninformation about the men in black.
0.5;But nobody would ask\Na detective like him for help,
0.5;much less give him\Ninformation about those men.
0.5;Come on now,\Nyou're too old to be acting like that.
0.5;You must feel kind of lonely since\Nyou just transferred here, right?
0.5;Shut up! You got a\Nproblem with me, Mitsuhiko?!
0.5;I'll never find those men in black\Nif things keep up like this.
0.5;Think what would happen\Nif you rushed things
0.5;and they found out that\Nyou're really Kudo Shinichi.
0.5;It would put not just me but all\Nthe people around me in real danger.
0.5;Shinichi didn't come\Nto school again today.
0.5;I'm sure he's just working on\Nanother one of his strange cases...
0.5;Don't worry. He'll be back home\Nsoon enough, I'm sure of it.
0.5;I've got her convinced for the time being,\Nbut how long can we keep this up?
0.5;I made something you'll find\Nuseful for your cases.
0.5;Turn the dial on the back\Nand you can make all kinds of voices.
0.5;You can sound like an old man,\Na child, a man, and even a woman.
0.5;I'm certain it'll come\Nin handy at some point!
0.5;I doubt that a detective agency\Nwould have much use for this...
0.5;We have no choice, we're gonna\Nforce him to be our friend!
0.5;The Mori Detective Agency is closed today.\NIf you've got a job for me...
0.5;No way! What would a celebrity\Nbe doing here?
0.5;The furniture's been moved\Nwhenever I come home,
0.5;somebody's been sending me\Ncandid photos they took of me,
0.5;and I've been getting\Nanonymous phone calls everyday!
0.5;If at all possible, we'd like\Nyou to look into it quietly.
0.5;I'll need your address\Nand phone number here.
0.5;Now that the great detective\NKogoro Mori is on the case,
0.5;I've always wanted to\Nsee a celebrity's home.
0.5;Just don't be getting\Nin the way! Got it?!
0.5;This is exactly the kind of place\NI thought Yoko Okino might live!
0.5;We definitely have to make\Nfriends with Conan-kun!
0.5;So, he had already been murdered\Nby the time you got back?
0.5;...was I, Kogoro Mori,\NInspector Megure!
0.5;Remember all those cases\Nwe worked on together?!
0.5;Yes. And thanks to you,\Nmost of them went unsolved!
0.5;Do you always have\Nthe heater on this high?
0.5;And I'm sure I turned\Nit off before I left.
0.5;That isn't the only thing\Nthat's odd, Inspector.
0.5;They're very faint, but there are\Ndamp spots all around the body.
0.5;And this chair is the only\Nthing still standing,
0.5;while everything else in the room\Nhas been thrown about.
0.5;Was it done to disguise\Nthe time of death?
0.5;Have you determined\Nthe cause of death?
0.5;It would seem this knife\Nwas the cause.
0.5;Why would her manager\Ntry to hide this?
0.5;The murder took place\Nwhile the door was locked.
0.5;Which means the murderer\Nwas the apartment's resident.
0.5;Don't people usually\Nhave a spare key?
0.5;Yoko gave you the cold shoulder so\Nyou took it out on him, didn't you?!
0.5;Hey, now. Where's the proof\Nthat she didn't do it?
0.5;Such a beautiful young woman\Nwould never do anything like that!
0.5;Yes, I did have her spare key,\Nbut I lost it 2 or 3 days ago...
0.5;I can vouch for him,\Nhe told me about it!
0.5;Well, if that's what\NYoko-san says, then...
0.5;I get the feeling that we're still\Nlacking something really important
0.5;I'll just set it to\Nan adult's voice, and...
0.5;Inspector, there's something\Nbeneath the sofa.
0.5;I heard that she was upset that Yoko\Ngot her role in a drama series...
0.5;The murderer was Yuko Ikezawa!\NArrest her!
0.5;No, let's have her come here\Nfor questioning!
0.5;Yuko Ikezawa did it!\NThere's no doubt about it!
0.5;Judging from the scene of the crime,\Nthe murderer must be Yoko Okino!
0.5;And the odd marks left\Nbehind in the room...
0.5;I've never been here\Nbefore now. I'm innocent.
0.5;I thought I lost that somewhere!\NI'm glad you found it!
0.5;The superintendent also said that\Nhe's seen someone who looks like you!
0.5;Someone who looks like me?\NThis is ridiculous.
0.5;You think I'm the murderer\Njust because of an earring?!
0.5;Not nearly as busy as little\NMiss Popular Celebrity, though...
0.5;But if the media gets wind of this,\Nyour image'll take a nosedive!
0.5;Maybe you'll lose as\Nmuch work as I have!
0.5;They both look exactly\Nthe same from behind...
0.5;Don't get in the way of their\Ninvestigation, Conan-kun.
0.5;But if Shinichi were here,\Nhe'd easily solve this case.
0.5;Where could that\Nmystery geek have gone?
0.5;Don't worry! He'll be back,\NI'm sure of it!
0.5;What do I have to say\Nfor you to understand?!
0.5;I already told you I've\Nnever been here before!
0.5;How did you know this was a lighter\Nif you've never been here before?
0.5;I know someone who has\None just like it.
0.5;I've never been here before,\Nso I don't know where it is.
0.5;Come to think of it, you knew\Nwhere the bathroom was, too!
0.5;Which is because you,\NYuko Ikezawa, are the murderer!
0.5;You killed that man in this apartment\Nto create a big scandal around Yoko-san!
0.5;All I did was defend myself\Nwhen he suddenly attacked me!
0.5;I'll admit it, I did sneak\Nin here several times
0.5;using the spare key I stole\Nfrom the dressing room.
0.5;I wanted to find something,\Nanything that could cause a scandal!
0.5;But when I came in this afternoon,\Nthat man suddenly showed up!
0.5;I defended myself\Nwith all of my strength...
0.5;...and then escaped\Nas quickly as I could!
0.5;Are you sure you didn't really kill him\Nin the heat of the moment?!
0.5;We've learned the identity\Nof the victim.
0.5;Upon graduating from\NKonan High School,
0.5;Isn't that your old high school,\NYoko-san?
0.5;No, I didn't just know him,\Nhe was my high school boyfriend!
0.5;I'm sorry, Yamagishi-san.\NI can't hide it.
0.5;Don't tell me you did this to\Nbreak up with your old flame!
0.5;After all, he was the one\Nwho dumped me.
0.5;We're still missing something\Nwe need to make any deductions!
0.5;Even though the room's in shambles,\Nthis chair is the only thing left standing.
0.5;And this room's exceptionally\Nhigh temperature...
0.5;The water splotches\Nleft around the body...
0.5;because he was capable of starting\Na scandal around Yoko-san!
0.5;Then you ran into him\Nwhile he was hiding in here
0.5;You're the only one left\Nwho could be the murderer!
0.5;Now then, I'll just set\Nit to his voice, and...
0.5;Which is what I would like to say,\Nbut that isn't the case.
0.5;If you really asked me to help you\Nso that I would discover the body,
0.5;you would have also prepared something\Nto prove your innocence.
0.5;especially since the 1st person to suspect\Nwould be the apartment's tenant.
0.5;So, then the murderer...\Nis Yuko Ikezawa!
0.5;Even if she did commit the murder\Nin the heat of the moment,
0.5;Yes, these are only\Neducated guesses at most.
0.5;They don't hold up as proof that\Nthe three of them are innocent.
0.5;You pretended to slip and then removed\Nstrands of hair from the body.
0.5;but he was holding the\Nstabber's hair in his hands.
0.5;The one responsible set it\Nall up to look like a murder...
0.5;As if he was killed\Nby Yoko-san herself...
0.5;Nonsense! How could he stab\Nhimself in the back with a knife?!
0.5;He set the heater on high,\Ntook hairs from Yoko-san's brush,
0.5;that was held in place\Nby a block of ice.
0.5;You'll find the indentation\Nmark made by the knife's handle
0.5;The ice shattered and later melted\Nbecause of the high heat.
0.5;However, Fujie-san tried\Ntoo hard to frame her.
0.5;he tried to hide it because he thought\NYoko-san had indeed killed him.
0.5;But why would Fujie-kun\Ndo something like this?
0.5;I would think that it was\Nbecause he still loved you.
0.5;So, he mistook Yuko-san\Nfor Yoko-san and attacked-
0.5;Not realizing he was talking\Nto Yuko-san and not Yoko-san,
0.5;and the feelings of his love being driven\Nto the wall turned into despair and hatred.
0.5;But he dumped me!\NWhy would he do that?
0.5;The truth is, I asked him\Nto break up with you.
0.5;We've found a diary in\Nthe late Fujie-san's house.
0.5;he was unable to forget about her,\Nso he went to see her.
0.5;He hoped she would end her career\Nas a celebrity and come back to him.
0.5;All he wanted to do was clear\Nup the misunderstandings.
0.5;The last thing he wrote was that\Nhe couldn't live like this any longer.
0.5;It would appear this was a tragic story\Nthat consisted of lies,
0.5;misunderstandings,\Nand coincidence.
0.5;"I've changed my mind about you,\N""Great Detective""!"
0.5;It was a little scary, but I've\Nnever been that excited before!
0.5;I think if we make friends\Nwith Conan-kun,
0.5;we'll get to experience lots\Nmore thrills and suspense!
0.5;Alright then! We've gotta get\NConan-kun to be our friend!

0.5;Waiting for us back at the\Ndetective agency was Koda Masao,
0.5;and buried somewhere in his yard,\Nso he wanted help finding her.
0.5;But sneaking onto others' property\Nand digging things up is illegal.
0.5;while Watanuki was at the hospital,\Nwe continued our stakeout!
0.5;What? You're the\None who first mentioned it!
0.5;That's right. We don't call\Npatients about such things here.
0.5;Team leader here!\NWhat's going on, Mitsuhiko?
0.5;Oh, brother. The old man\Njust headed back there in a taxi!
0.5;Hey! Mister! Watanuki-san\Nis gonna be back soon!
0.5;He's gonna see you\Nif you don't hurry and run!
0.5;Get out! Get out this instant!\NThat goes for you, too!
0.5;You're turning yourself in, right?\NI know an inspector there!
0.5;Inspector Megure, correct?\NI've been expecting you.
0.5;What is this, Koda-san?\NDid you really commit a jewel robbery?
0.5;so you'll have to dig\Nup the yard to find them.
0.5;So, you'll have to dig the\Nwhole yard up to find them all!
0.5;Don't tell me you did the robbery\Nto have the police dig up this yard?!
0.5;Then you never intended\Nto escape from the start?!
0.5;Koda-san just wanted enough\Ntime to dig holes in the yard.
0.5;That's why he left a\Njewel on the station stairs
0.5;and made it look\Nlike he escaped by train!
0.5;This is the model\Ngun I used in the robbery.
0.5;Mori-kun there has told me\Nabout your incident with Koda-san.
0.5;Y-You can't be serious!\NWhat gives you the right?!
0.5;It's absolutely necessary for\Nthe investigation of the jewel robbery.
0.5;Or is there some reason digging\Nup your yard would be bad for you?
0.5;In that case... Takagi-kun!\NContact headquarters!
0.5;What's that smile for?!\NDon't tell me he--?!
0.5;The jewels are quite small!\NDig everything up!
0.5;I don't think there are\Nany bodies buried here...
0.5;We are looking hard!\NWhere else are we supposed to dig?!
0.5;Maybe I should use this opportunity\Nto start a vegetable garden.
0.5;Shut up! Sanae is here! I know\Nshe's buried in this yard somewhere!
0.5;I can understand how you feel,\Nbut there's no point in continuing this.
0.5;Yeah, no matter what his reason,\Nhe did commit a jewel robbery.
0.5;Because there was\Nnever one to begin with.
0.5;"Watanuki-san didn't kill her; she went\Nmissing for some other reason."
0.5;But it's a fact she said she was\Ngoing to visit Watanuki-san's house
0.5;before heading home\Non the night of May 8th, right?
0.5;was that that co-worker gave\Nher some cosmos seeds during lunch.
0.5;Yeah, don't you remember?\NKoda-san said she loved cosmos flowers.
0.5;is that she was caught up in\Nsome incident and went missing
0.5;on her way to Watanuki-san's\Nhouse from her company.
0.5;Supposedly, the police are going\Nto investigate from that angle, too.
0.5;Hmm, maybe it was buried under\Na floorboard instead of the garden?
0.5;No. There wouldn't have been\Na digging sound in the back alley.
0.5;If we check the newspapers from May 8th,\Nwe might find something!
0.5;Yeah! But we don't want to\Ncheck newspapers from the 8th.
0.5;Because news from the night of\Nthe 8th won't be in that day's paper.
0.5;There's a Masked Yaiba show at\NToto Dept. Store the 23rd and 24th!
0.5;Genta-kun. You're reading\Nlast month's paper.
0.5;Not to mention,\Nwe all went to that show!
0.5;There was a strong easterly wind\Nfrom the night of the 8th to the 9th.
0.5;so let's go see the Mochida-san\Nperson who heard the digging sound!
0.5;Yeah, there was loud\Nconstruction on this road that night.
0.5;So I hurried into this alley,\Nand lit a cigarette a little ways down.
0.5;That's when I heard a\Nshovel by the house to the left.
0.5;Yeah. I'm certain of it.\NI heard it coming from my left.
0.5;There was a construction\Ntruck parked there.
0.5;So I went into the alley while\Nthinking what a nuisance it was.
0.5;Yeah, it was around\Nhere where I lit my cigarette.
0.5;Say! Was there a strong\Nwind coming straight at you?!
0.5;Yes! We, the Junior\NDetective League, found it!
0.5;Forget 'em. The brats are\Nobviously spewing nonsense.
0.5;But Shinichi-niichan said\Nthere was no doubt about it, too!
0.5;What is this about, Inspector?!\NI'd like an explanation!
0.5;The night of May 8th,\NKoda-san's sister, Sanae-san,
0.5;Ridiculous! What nonsense!\NThey dug up the entire yard yesterday!
0.5;But you buried the body not\Nin your yard, but somewhere else!
0.5;Hey, Conan! Where in\Nthis room could she be?!
0.5;At the time of the incident,\Nits construction was going as scheduled.
0.5;Burying a body there would mean\Nit wouldn't be dug up for decades.
0.5;But something unexpected\Nhappened half a month later.
0.5;The apartments' construction\Nwas suddenly canceled.
0.5;Eh?! Then they're\Ngoing to be demolished?!
0.5;It's very possible. And the\Nbody would be found right away.
0.5;And that's why Watanuki-san\Nstopped leaving the house
0.5;And it's why he watched the\Npremises with these binoculars.
0.5;The area is fenced off,\Nand the gate was locked that night!
0.5;You speak as if you\Ninvestigated these things.
0.5;By sheer coincidence,\Nhe used the exact same method!
0.5;so this house's back entrance\Ncouldn't be seen from the main street.
0.5;I see! So the sewer\Nsystem connects here!
0.5;The night of May 8th,\Nmajor construction covered the main street,
0.5;This is all nothing\Nbut that child's conjecture!
0.5;So what if I could've\Nentered this parking lot?!
0.5;Anyone could've used\Nthat method to get in here!
0.5;The body of Koda-san's sister\Nis resting beneath this plant.
0.5;But, Conan-kun!\NHow do you know it's here?!
0.5;Oh, yeah! A coworker gave your\Nsister some cosmos seeds that day!
0.5;And one must've fallen out\Nand sprouted after she was buried...
0.5;I snapped that night when\Nshe refused to compensate me...
0.5;That night, his sister's body was\Nfound beneath the cosmos seedling.
0.5;After that, Koda-san was given\Na suspended sentence for his robbery.
0.5;He decided to return to his\Nhometown with the cosmos seedling.
0.5;And thus the mystery\Nof the Mole Alien was solved!

0.5;If they didn't leave any clues, \Nthen the plan doesn't work.
0.5;someone was seen fleeing the \Nscene of Otsubo's murder.
0.5;Apparently the caller asked if the \Nsuspicious figure might've been
0.5;"the ""unlucky man"" who's \Nbeen seen online recently,"
0.5;But if their ultimate goal \Nlies beyond what I thought...

0.5;that you experienced two similar \Nincidents in half a month.
0.5;That's what made us suspect \NKagura-san did it for the money.
0.5;Not that! I'm asking why Kochiyama \Nwould try to frame me!

0.5;He hoped to stumble upon \Ninteresting material if he did.
0.5;But something made Otsubo-san realize that \Nyou were the one who made the bomb threat.
0.5;Today you anonymously called the police \Nso you could reach your ultimate goal.
0.5;"It might've been the ""unlucky man"" \Nwho's been seen online recently."
0.5;You were vague so the police \Nwouldn't arrive immediately.
0.5;In other words, this was \Nthe story you came up with.
0.5;You planned to tell the police that's what he \Nsaid, and when they responded to your call...
0.5;I thought Kagura was just drinking a beer, \Nbut then he suddenly started choking...
0.5;You planned to act as though he killed \Nhimself out of desperation, didn't you?
0.5;You were going to kill me and \Nmake it look like a suicide?
0.5;Based on your reaction, \Nit sounds like he's right.
0.5;but there's nothing romantic \Nabout your relationship.
0.5;Kochiyama-san secretly desired \Nto make Haruka-san his own
0.5;But the police would investigate \Nif he simply murdered you,
0.5;That's when you suffered collateral \Ndamage from the unexploded bomb
0.5;Having gotten a taste for \Nthe monetary compensation,

0.5;but things got out of control, \Nso you took your own life.
0.5;In other words, his plan was already \Nin motion when he took this picture.
0.5;Otsubo-san probably didn't \Nknow about the plan,
0.5;He went as far as to kill a person to \Nstrengthen your motive for suicide.
0.5;If we find poison in the glass \NKagura-san was meant to drink from,
0.5;the police will begin their investigation \Ninto this attempted murder.
0.5;He didn't think anything \Nof it at the time, though.

0.5;Seventeen years ago, the four-crowned shogi \Nmaster took his crowns and went to America

0.5;Whoever kept the list didn't list the \Nvictims in the order they were killed.
0.5;Maybe they were grouped according \Nto their blood types.
0.5;And if that drug was around \Nseventeen years ago, then...
0.5;All I did was scrape together the data \Nthat survived the fire and recreated it.

0.5;The wealthy woman who was \Nmurdered was over 80 years old.

0.5;The vegetables in the cream stew you shared \Nwith us the other day were completely raw.
0.5;It felt like you'd been listening \Nin on our conversation,
0.5;and hurriedly brought over \Nthe food you were making
0.5;In that case, I'd appreciate it if you \Ncould recook the food while we're gone.
0.5;I'm pretty sure I used the right \Ningredients and seasoning.
0.5;I was actually involved in the \Ndevelopment of those scissors.
0.5;The victim was the president \Nof a real estate company,
0.5;and owner of the house, Hiyama \NKunihisa-san, sixty-one years old.
0.5;He was bludgeoned to death \Nwith a blunt object.
0.5;and fled into the changing \Nroom of the bathroom,
0.5;but the culprit broke through \Nthe door and finished him off.
0.5;Can we assume the victim \Nthrew this cup at his killer
0.5;Then the victim attempted to defend \Nhimself with these scissors,
0.5;invented by Professor Agasa, \Nthat he used to trim his mustache?
0.5;for defending oneself against \Na killer with a blunt object,
0.5;I came here today to help \Nexplain the scissors.
0.5;Apparently these scissors make \Na sound when they're closed,
0.5;I thought he was holding them because \Nhe recorded the killer's voice.
0.5;But there's blood on the shards \Nof glass near the entrance.
0.5;if we compare this blood with the blood \Nof the people who came to the house?
0.5;It belongs to the person \Nwho discovered the body?
0.5;but his son and wife sold the property \Nto President Hiyama without his approval,
0.5;there are iron bars on all of\Nthe windows of the annex.
0.5;Those two bodyguards were \Nat the only entrance,
0.5;They would've known immediately if \Nsomeone was carrying a blunt weapon.
0.5;President Hiyama had a lot of enemies \Nbecause of his dishonest business practices.
0.5;the only thing that could serve \Nas a weapon was that mop.
0.5;Senba-san entered the annex and called \Nout to him, but there was no answer.
0.5;The bathroom door was \Nopen, so he went to look.
0.5;He saw President Hiyama on the \Nfloor and bleeding from the head.
0.5;When he ran to the body, he stepped \Non a shard of glass near the door.
0.5;He's being treated by a police \Nofficer in the main house.
0.5;but was the sink in the \Nchanging room left running?
0.5;It's very similar to the murder of \NHaneda Kenji seventeen years ago.
0.5;Akai-san, you were involved in the \NHaneda Koji case seventeen years ago?
0.5;No, it was my father who \Nwas directly involved.
0.5;Th-Then was your dad an \NFBI investigator, too?
0.5;I thought you were going to let me leave \Nonce they were finished treating my cut.
0.5;That's Senba Kazunori-san, the \Nman who discovered the body.
0.5;Ah, the man who injured himself stepping on \Na piece of a broken cup at the crime scene.
0.5;Excuse me, but did you step on \Nthe glass with your right foot?
0.5;It looked like you were favoring \Nyour right leg as you walked.
0.5;of when I broke it in a \Ntraffic accident last month.
0.5;I ended up in the hospital \Nuntil last week because of it.
0.5;No, he helped develop the scissors \Nthe victim Hiyama-san was holding.
0.5;Would you be willing to recreate the \Ncircumstances under which you found the body?
0.5;If you performed a certain \Naction near the body,
0.5;In any case, why don't you do what \Nyou did when you found the body?
0.5;so I entered the annex and called \Nout to him, but he didn't answer.
0.5;I noticed the door to the \Nbathroom changing room was open.
0.5;so he's recreating the steps \Nhe took when he found the body.
0.5;Then you saw Hiyama-san \Nbleeding from the head
0.5;and lying on the ground, \Nso you ran to him, right?
0.5;Even though there were clearly \Npieces of a cup all over the floor?
0.5;Then I punctured my foot \Nwhen I ran to the body.
0.5;most of the shards should have been \Npushed to the other side of the door.
0.5;then there should be more \Nshards closer to the entrance.
0.5;I was distracted by the body \Nand didn't look at the floor.
0.5;If I hit someone hard enough to make \Nthem bleed, I'd have blood on me.
0.5;Mister, the bottom buttons on your \Nshirt are in the wrong holes.

0.5;I-In any case, I didn't have a blunt \Nobject that could serve as the weapon!
0.5;have anything to do with the \Nfeature of Agasa-san's scissors?
0.5;Apparently the Fusae Brand collaborated \Nwith a tableware maker to make those cups.
0.5;So what does the cup have \Nto do with the scissors?
0.5;I smelled a strange smell \Ncoming from the body.
0.5;There was some kind of honey-like \Npaste in the wound on the body.
0.5;Does the honey have anything \Nto do with the scissors?
0.5;If it doesn't, then could you \Nplease leave the crime scene?

0.5;Where did President Hayashi go \Nafter we parted ways last night?

0.5;Come to think of it, I saw gold dust on \NSoichi-san when he was being carried away.
0.5;Maybe Takumi-san works \Nwith gold dust at his job.

0.5;so the bracelet is meant \Nto prevent that, right?
0.5;I'm an apprentice in traditional \NKanazawa gold foil crafts.
0.5;If your gold dust was stuck to the \Npresident, that means you met with him last night.
0.5;Then why don't you explain why there \Nwas gold dust stuck to the president?
0.5;Last night, I went to the president's \Noffice to steal some money.
0.5;If he had 30 million yen, I thought he \Nwouldn't notice if a little bit went missing.

0.5;He resents your father because he \Nfailed to steal the money once.
0.5;It's possible he returned last night \Nto try to steal the money again,

0.5;But he did in fact try to trick him out \Nof his money with a fake kidnapping.
0.5;Why is Mari-san so desperate \Nto defend Manabu-san?

0.5;Manabu-san and Rintaro-san are \Nmaster and apprentice, right?
0.5;I don't think Rintaro-kun thought \Nvery highly of Manabu-san.
0.5;I secretly follow Rintaro-kun's \Nsocial media accounts.

0.5;I know you've been communicating frequently \Nwith Manabu-san since last night.
0.5;I felt bad for my master, so I \Ndecided to help him steal the money.
0.5;there was no need for them to do something \Nas drastic as faking a kidnapping.
0.5;They could have simply stolen \Nthe money from the safe.

0.5;But the implausibility of the coincidence \Nisn't a strong enough basis for anything.
0.5;then it's possible he saw \NKagura-san make the call.
0.5;I was waiting to confirm that, \Nbut Otsubo-san hasn't come home.
0.5;We don't know the details yet, but \Nhe was probably struck with a rock.

0.5;It's possible Edogawa-kun \Nis right and Otsubo-san

0.5;At the time, he probably didn't \Nknow he was making a bomb threat.

0.5;The old man's reasoning was right, \Nbut in reality, there are two cases!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;an investigation of his crime and search \Nfor corroborating evidence were conducted.
0.5;Once again, we have an \Nannouncement for our guests.
0.5;"the start time of the lecture ""The Great \NDetective Mori Kogoro Reveals His Secrets"""
0.5;the start time of the old man's \Nlecture was delayed an hour.
0.5;Anyway, I'm terribly sorry \Nfor the inconvenience,
0.5;I'm honored I was invited \Nto appear on the panel.
0.5;But that alibi applies only to \NInokoshi Kenichiro-san's murder.
0.5;Reizei may have confessed to \NHishida Junko-san's murder,
0.5;Disregarding the achievements \Nof the late previous owner—
0.5;I wanted her to understand, so we \Ncontinued our conversation there.
0.5;That's the time the victim's pocket watch \Nbroken by the weapon was stopped at.
0.5;Which means Inokoshi-san \Nwasn't killed by Reizei-san.
0.5;I know it's a coincidence, \Nbut this isn't good.
0.5;the people whose alibis we verified for \NInokoshi-san's murder were all innocent.
0.5;Is it true that the owner \NHishida was killed as well?
0.5;None other than the great detective \NSleeping Kogoro is here.
0.5;And don't mention the case until the \Npolice explain the situation later.
0.5;Do you not care about \Nthe game? It's starting.
0.5;We have less than thirty minutes \Nuntil the old man's lecture starts.
0.5;Maybe so, but we need to come with \Nan excuse to tell those kids.
0.5;Judging by the quality of the paper and \Nprint, they're probably from the same magazine.
0.5;There's been a guard standing in front of this \Nchanging room since after the scene was examined.
0.5;So they reached in through the \Nwindow so they wouldn't be spotted?
0.5;The question is who left it \Nhere, and for what purpose.
0.5;I feel like there's some meaning \Nbehind the way they're overlapped.
0.5;If you found something, shouldn't \Nyou let Mori-san know?
0.5;Jeez. You went off and found \Nsomething trivial again.
0.5;We thought you solved the trick \Nused to create the locked room,
0.5;but if Reizei-san's cane wasn't used to \Nprop up the chair with the body in it,
0.5;In any case, there isn't a \Nsingle person without an alibi.
0.5;We can't proceed with our investigation \Nif we can't solve that mystery.
0.5;Maybe it's wrong to assume it \Nwas a long object like a cane.
0.5;But recently they sell \Ntelescoping canes, too.
0.5;I'm talking about your \Ntelescoping nightstick.
0.5;pressed it against the back of the chair \Nsupporting Inokoshi-san's body, tilted it,
0.5;and withdrew it while gradually closing \Nthe door, creating the locked room.
0.5;Would you hand over your \Nnightstick, Tsukinogi-san?
0.5;We'd like to see if the end of your \Nnightstick matches the mark left on the chair.
0.5;I went to the bathroom \Nimmediately after arriving.
0.5;I took it off and left it in this \Nchanging room, and it went missing.
0.5;But when I just checked, \Nit had been returned.
0.5;I don't know who it was, but \NI thought it was strange.
0.5;I was with several others \Nwhen the murder took place.
0.5;Weren't you, the police, \Nthe ones who verified that?
0.5;Forgive me, Mori-san, but \NI'm disappointed in you.
0.5;Is this the best the great \NSleeping Kogoro can do?
0.5;Wasn't that the time shown on the victim's \Npocket watch that was broken by the weapon?
0.5;They broke it beforehand and \Nset the hands pointing at 2:50.
0.5;In other words, the murder actually \Ntook place earlier than that.
0.5;Takagi, Chiba. Reconfirm \Ntheir alibis immediately.
0.5;Tsukinogi-san met with event \Ncompany president Tsunohazu-san
0.5;But no one saw Tsukinogi-san during \Nthe ten minutes before that.
0.5;We spoke with the others, and \Nthey all gave the same answer.
0.5;Maybe it's a piece of glass from the \Npocket watch broken by the weapon.
0.5;there's no way a piece of \Nglass could've gotten on you
0.5;if the pocket watch was inside \Nthe victim's jacket was broken,
0.5;And the pieces could only have \Ngotten on the person who broke it.
0.5;I was just about to say \Nthe same thing, Inspector.
0.5;one year ago while guarding Inokoshi-san, \Nhe caught a woman stalking him.
0.5;She was actually Inokoshi-san's \Nex-girlfriend who was seeking an apology
0.5;Because of that, he and the \Nsecurity company he manages
0.5;Her detective skills certainly \Nare impressive, but...
0.5;The HISHIDA Hall renovation \Ncommemorative lecture,
0.5;presented by the Sleeping \NKogoro, Mori Kogoro himself,
0.5;"""The Great Detective Mori Kogoro \NReveals His Secrets"" will now begin."
0.5;I'm Hanai Rika, Nichiuri TV announcer, \Nand I'll be your MC today.
0.5;Red leather, yellow leather. \NRed leather, yellow leather.
0.5;The case has already been solved, \Nso I won't be sleeping today.
0.5;The subject of today's lecture \Nis a great detective's secrets,
0.5;and as such, I will be telling you \Nall about my abundant experience.
0.5;The audience was informed that \Ndue to certain circumstances,
0.5;panelists Inokoshi Kenichiro-san and \NTsukinogi Hideki-san
0.5;until the police made their \Nofficial announcement.
0.5;But thanks to Mori-sensei, \Nthe cases were solved.
0.5;Keep up the same energy during \Nthe panel, Kisaki-sensei.
0.5;But doesn't that mean it'll be \Njust the two of us going onstage?
0.5;We're looking for pages \Ntorn from this magazine.
0.5;All right! I'm not sure what's \Ngoing on, but let's do this!
0.5;It seems you have some questions \Nfor the Sleeping Kogoro.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Mori \NKogoro's Grand Lecture, Part Three!"""
0.5;Toyama Kazuha and Hattori \NHeiji came to invite us
0.5;to see the holiday lights \Neveryone's talking about.
0.5;While waiting for Ran and Kazuha \Nto finish making dinner,
0.5;That's when Beika University \Ndrama club members
0.5;When he was stabbed, some \Nblood flew onto my face.
0.5;Listen, detectives, you \Nseem to think we did it.
0.5;for the blackout and came inside to \Nstab him with night vision goggles?
0.5;Immediately after that man \Nwas stabbed and screamed,
0.5;That's why you were standing next \Nto the door when the lights came on.
0.5;No. I just happened to \Nbe using my phone to—
0.5;Come to think of it, you \Nhaven't told us your name yet.
0.5;He beautifully dances his \Nmystery-solving steps!
0.5;A case at the Poirot Café \Nis tackled by Heiji, Amuro,
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""Solving Mysteries at the \NPoirot Café, Part Two!"""
0.5;"H-He meant to say ""your \Nfavorite Shinichi-niichan."""
0.5;I thought of a trick to avoid \Ngetting blood on yourself, though.
0.5;I gotta solve this quick \Nso we can go to Kinza.
0.5;You said you and Anzai-san \Nare just childhood friends,
0.5;If there's something going \Non, could you tell me?
0.5;Honestly, I have way too \Nmany secrets at the moment.
0.5;You know how late the Kinza \Nlights are staying on?
0.5;"""From between long clouds \Nblown by the fall wind,"
0.5;"the moonlight shining through \Nis beautiful indeed."""
0.5;I don't think we could've stabbed anyone \Nin the pitch blackness of the blackout.
0.5;I was in the bathroom \Nsince before the blackout,
0.5;The peep hole in the bathroom \Ndoor is made with frosted glass.
0.5;"""From between long clouds \Nblown by the fall wind,"
0.5;"the moonlight shining through \Nis beautiful indeed."""
0.5;And the culprit also saw who was \Nsitting where through a gap.
0.5;The man who was hiding in the bathroom and \Nsecretly watching through the peep hole...
0.5;My science teacher told \Nme that if you put tape
0.5;on the rough side of frosted \Nglass, it's like normal glass.
0.5;Try putting some tape on the \Npeep hole and look through it.
0.5;I can see through the \Nspot covered by the tape.
0.5;It's difficult to see through frosted \Nglass because tiny scratches
0.5;on its surface reflect light, \Nmaking it appear cloudy.
0.5;the adhesive on the tape fills \Nthe scratches in the glass,
0.5;flattening the surface and \Nmaking it transparent.
0.5;There was tape on the birthday \Npresent you got for Yui-san.
0.5;E-Even if I could see the \Nothers through the peep hole,
0.5;I couldn't have stabbed \Nanyone in the darkness.
0.5;in the same layout at this café so \Nyou could stab someone in the dark.
0.5;If you built a set identical to \Nthis café for your play last year,
0.5;E-Even if I knew the exact layout, \Nit'd still be hard to stab someone.
0.5;From the front, their hands would get in \Nthe way, making it difficult to stab them.
0.5;That's why you came first and \Nput your bag on the booth seat,
0.5;knowing your girlfriend \NYui-san would sit next to it.
0.5;the victim would be forced to sit in \Neither of the chairs opposite them.
0.5;Even if I could stab him, I \Nwould've gotten blood on me!
0.5;It's like Tinkerbell's gonna\Nshow up any minute.
0.5;Anyway, you shouldn't have \Nsuddenly changed where we'd meet.
0.5;Yeah. Some guy was stabbed \Nand taken to the hospital.
0.5;He used toilet paper to prevent \Nblood from getting on himself?
0.5;You couldn't block all the blood \Njust by covering your arms.
0.5;By holding the tube in place \Nas you pulled the knife out,
0.5;you could avoid getting \Nany blood on yourself.
0.5;Otherwise you couldn't have \Nstabbed him through the tube.
0.5;A little blood's bound \Nto come through the tube,
0.5;but as long as you don't point the \Nopening towards yourself, you're okay.
0.5;Instead, those of us sitting in front \Nof the tube got blood all over us.
0.5;Then you returned to the bathroom and \Nwaited for the lights to come back on,
0.5;flushed the toilet paper \Nwrapped around your arms,
0.5;and stuck the tube you used \Nback inside the toilet paper.
0.5;Then you removed the \Ntape from the peep hole
0.5;and stuck it back on the gift \Nand came out of the bathroom.
0.5;No, you may have removed the \Ntape before the lights came on.
0.5;By folding the end of the tape over \Nand making it easier to grab,
0.5;they might have noticed that \Nthere was something stuck to it.
0.5;That's a sure sign the tube was \Nforced inside it afterwards.
0.5;Honestly, I was scared since the \Nknife went deeper than I expected.
0.5;Yui-san, you said you were keeping \Nthe secret to protect someone,
0.5;and that you didn't think you \Nhad any secrets as a child.
0.5;"The reason you said \N""someone"" instead of Tengo"
0.5;is because you meant someone \Nrelated to Anzai-san,
0.5;or in this case, Anzai-san's \Nfather the Dietman.
0.5;it means it would be a career \Nending scandal for a Dietman.
0.5;In other words, Yui-san is \Nhis lover's secret lovechild.
0.5;Well, my behavior was \Nhardly worthy of praise.
0.5;In any case, I sent Yui's \Nbirthday video to your phone.
0.5;Yui said not to say anything, \Nbut I don't care!
0.5;You should've tried talking \Nto him before stabbing him.
0.5;Well, I guess we can interview \Nthe people who are still here.
0.5;from the Meiji Era of the Sherlock \NHolmes stories were set in Japan.
0.5;Watson was an army surgeon \Nnamed Wada Shinichi.
0.5;And since he called himself Wada Shinichi \Ninstead of using Komuro Tairoku,
0.5;there's a Holmes-esque \Nindividual standing behind me,
0.5;His reasoning skills lived \Nup to his reputation.
0.5;You could hear the sound of something \Nbeing ripped off under the man's scream.
0.5;Now that you mention it, I \Nthought I heard something.
0.5;His appearance, personality, and reasoning\Nabilities leave nothing to be desired.
0.5;There does seem to be a \Ngirl he's interested in,
0.5;I, Iori, shall do everything \NI can to support you.
0.5;It's exactly the kind of thing that \Nmoonlit magician-thief goes after.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Kaito \NKid and the Trick Box, Part One!"""
0.5;We came to visit the shooting \Nlocation of a zombie movie.
0.5;Hattori and Kazuha were also \Nthere to investigate rumors
0.5;the crew shooting the sequel to \Nthe zombie movie also arrived.
0.5;But during filming, the producer \NHarawaki Takashi-san died.
0.5;Due to the video of him \Ndrinking poison and something
0.5;that appeared to be a \Nsuicide note on his phone,
0.5;Anyway, I'm more interested in the Naito \NJoji he mentioned at the beginning.
0.5;He was the president of \Nour college horror club.
0.5;It's possible that it \Ninfluenced Harawaki-kun.
0.5;Why don't we make this a mystery \Ninstead of a horror film?
0.5;Aren't you the one who suggested \Nwe shoot a zombie movie?
0.5;The twist will be that the \Nreal murderer isn't a zombie,
0.5;If you don't think we can do \Nit, I'll vanish from this room.
0.5;Like a corpse that's returned \Nto life as a zombie.
0.5;so Ninomiya-kun and I \Nkept watch at the window.
0.5;When we entered the \Nroom after ten minutes,
0.5;We thought he might've \Nescaped through the window
0.5;while Ria and Ninomiya-kun were \Ncoming around the cottage.
0.5;S-So we searched the forest, but \Nwe couldn't find him anywhere.
0.5;So we ditched the president \Nand went into town to drink.
0.5;Then Ria caught a cold and \Nwas down for three days.
0.5;On the day of the fourth morning, \Nwhen we returned to the cottage...
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;The president appears \Nto have become a zombie.
0.5;They start closing in on \Nthe mysterious mansion.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""A Cottage Surrounded \NBy Zombies, Part Two!"""
0.5;The police said it had been \Nabout twelve hours.
0.5;indicating he'd scratched something \Nhard enough for his nails to come off.
0.5;But there were no scratches \Nanywhere in the room.
0.5;Before we found the body, we'd all gone \Nto Ria's apartment to take care of her!
0.5;Although I had a bunch of rare \Nhorror movie DVDs at my apartment,
0.5;Harawaki-kun was the only \None of us could drive,
0.5;Someone's dead, but we \Ncan't even call the police.
0.5;Can't we call the police \Non our cell phones, then?
0.5;Then we'll have to wait for \NRan-chan's dad to get better.
0.5;it might actually solve the mystery \Nbehind Harawaki-kun's suicide.
0.5;I was actually about to \Nsuggest the same thing.
0.5;I wish they'd stop telling \Nscary stories already.
0.5;Are you sure your fever isn't \Nmaking you hallucinate?
0.5;Looks like we're going to \Nhave to stay here tonight.
0.5;Apparently there's a convenience store \Nabout a three hour hike down the mountain.
0.5;Maybe we can use the phone there to \Ncall the police and an ambulance.
0.5;while shooting the movie \Nfor their school festival.
0.5;I can't believe all the \Nmembers of the horror club
0.5;That's why the director invited \Nthem to work with him.
0.5;He asked if they wanted to finish the \Nmovie his brother wanted to make.
0.5;Apparently he found the script \Nfor the movie at his house.
0.5;Apparently they upgraded \Nthe script they wrote
0.5;It turned out to be a bigger \Nhit than they expected.
0.5;The zombie movie trailer they \Ncame to shoot this time
0.5;I'm a little scared to hike down the \Nmountain to the convenience store, though.
0.5;Usually hordes like these will back \Ndown if you kill their leader.
0.5;I thought they were a gang \Npretending to be zombies.
0.5;We pitched tents in the forest and \Nhelped each other with our makeup.
0.5;We waited until eight when the \Naudition started while bugs bit us.
0.5;When I went to practice on a couple who \Ncame to visit the filming location,
0.5;they ran over my fake head with \Ntheir car and broke it.
0.5;It took me two days to fix it, \Nand now look at what you've done.
0.5;So this guy was the zombie \Nthat attacked the couple.
0.5;"""I'm holding an audition for \Nextras, so gather all zombies!"""
0.5;There was an announcement on a hidden \Nwebsite only core fans know about.
0.5;He told us not to tell anyone since he \Nwanted to surprise the director and crew.
0.5;Harawaki-san was supposed to \Ncome out and say it was a prank.
0.5;A man with this kind of surprise planned \Nwouldn't kill himself, would he?
0.5;Sounds like the extras got in \Nthrough the second story window.
0.5;Ran-neechan, ask the zombies \Ndownstairs to call the police.
0.5;What was the situation \Nupstairs when you found her?
0.5;But we decided it'd be \Nbetter to stick together.
0.5;When we came to this room \Nto look for Kyoko-kun...
0.5;Just like Harawaki-san's, \Nthis one is recording.
0.5;D-Does that mean the culprit \Nwas recorded on it?
0.5;The first person to enter \Nthe frame is Kyoko-san.
0.5;When Ran-chan and I came in earlier, \Nthe sheet was still over it.
0.5;All that's in the room is the \Nsheet that was covering the body,
0.5;the top Kyoko-san was wearing \Nbefore she was murdered,
0.5;I think that's the one \Nthat was in the toolbox.
0.5;The culprit must've used it \Nto cut Kyoko-san's throat.
0.5;You can tell by looking \Nat the cut on her artery.
0.5;The question is why did the \Nculprit prop up Kyoko-san's phone
0.5;Did anyone come out of this window \Nor drop anything out of it?
0.5;they don't remember who \Nwent in which rooms,
0.5;Looks like no one exited \Nthrough this window, either.
0.5;There could be a hidden \Npassageway under the bed.
0.5;Th-There doesn't seem to be a secret \Ndoor behind the wardrobe, either.
0.5;he turned into a zombie \Nand escaped from the room!
0.5;But eight years ago, Harawaki-kun and \NKyoko and I searched this room, too!
0.5;and was found dead four \Ndays later in this room!
0.5;The corpse of a man who disappeared \Nhad reappeared in front of me.
0.5;Now that you mention it, I let my brother \Nborrow a bunch of stuff to shoot his movie,
0.5;but that's the only thing \Nthat didn't come back.
0.5;that maybe the culprit used the hand truck \Nto move the president's body into the room.
0.5;B-But the hand truck had been missing \Nsince before the president disappeared.
0.5;and someone else was murdered \Nby the man we thought was dead.
0.5;Conan-kun, did you figure \Nout who did it, too?
0.5;The moment he attacked \NKyoko was captured on film!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""A Cottage \NSurrounded By Zombies, Part Three!"""
0.5;The Gunma Prefectural Police \Nwill be arriving next episode.
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut cases are even more so!
0.5;Today is the pottery\Ncase solution!
0.5;There are no cracks\Nin Conan's logic!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;Kikuemon-san, a potter and\Nliving national treasure,
0.5;Masuko-san broke Kikuemon-san's\Nlatest work, the Fusui-maru!
0.5;That night, during a get-together,\NMasuko-san became very drunk.
0.5;The following\Nmorning in the storeroom...
0.5;Were you really all\Ntogether in the stateroom?
0.5;Don't tell me you pretended to\Nwake her and hung her in her sleep!
0.5;Her room is only two\Nover from the stateroom!
0.5;I think he was gone\Nfor less than ten seconds.
0.5;He couldn't have done\Nanything in such a short time...
0.5;Well, I left for a\Nshort moment to call her.
0.5;We thought she\Nhad gone somewhere.
0.5;I only called her cell phone from\Nthe phone in the connecting hallway.
0.5;That's right. I had Masuko-san\Nalways carry a cell phone.
0.5;so that we could focus\Non making our works.
0.5;Things like business transactions\Nand scheduling exhibitions.
0.5;But that's odd. We didn't\Nfind a cell phone by her body.
0.5;Oh, a cell phone was\Nfound in the victim's room.
0.5;She always put it under her\Npillow and used it as an alarm clock.
0.5;The cell phone\Nwas apparently turned off.
0.5;Then who could have carried\Nher in here and killed her?
0.5;Assuming she was found\Nright after she was hanged,
0.5;everyone has an alibi\Nof being in the stateroom.
0.5;and her feet weren't dirty because\Nshe used the stepping stones
0.5;between the house\Nand the storeroom.
0.5;Plus, she had broken the\NFusui-maru in this storeroom.
0.5;I can imagine her seeing\Nthe storeroom when she woke up
0.5;That's true. The rope was used\Nin this storeroom for packing things.
0.5;Plus we all heard the pot\Nbreak at the same time.
0.5;until we examine the\Nstoreroom in more detail.
0.5;I ask that you all wait in the\Nstateroom for the time being.
0.5;Please don't do\Nanything without permission.
0.5;Still, too many things\Nare out of the ordinary.
0.5;Her unusual lack of footwear\Nand the clean bottoms of her feet...
0.5;...this marble I found by the broken\NFusui-maru the day before...
0.5;Something I saw at the\Nscene of the crime is bugging me!
0.5;Only kids would be\Ninterested in junk like that.
0.5;Maybe so, but you\Ncan't just barge in here.
0.5;I finally found a trace\Nthat the killer failed to hide!
0.5;The fact it's here\Nmeans that up above is...
0.5;Using this method, you wouldn't\Nneed to be in the room to kill her!
0.5;But to ensure she would die,\Nit would have to be around there...
0.5;We just checked that area,\Nbut there was nothing out of the ordinary!
0.5;Yeah. Doesn't seem to\Nbe anything but pottery here...
0.5;Which means one\Nof those two is the killer...
0.5;He laid a trap for her and killed\Nher to make it look like a suicide...
0.5;The question now is\Nhow to tell Inspector Megure...
0.5;Umm, how long do we\Nhave to stay in the stateroom?
0.5;Oh, I'm sorry!\NWe'll still be a little while longer!
0.5;Could we get something to eat?\NWe haven't eaten at all today...
0.5;Oh, that should be fine,\Nas long as you tell my men first!
0.5;No! If they do that,\Nthe evidence'll be gone!
0.5;Evidence, my butt! This was\Na suicide! There was no killer!
0.5;Guess I'll just have to knock him\Nout with this stun-gun wristwatch...
0.5;Say! I found the thing\Nyou were talking about earlier!
0.5;You don't care if I say it\Nout loud for everyone to hear?
0.5;As I was saying,\Nearlier, you told me...
0.5;Now I'll just put the\Nbutton speaker on his collar...
0.5;Evidence that the killer failed\Nto hide completely, of course!
0.5;Yes. She didn't commit\Nsuicide at all. She was murdered.
0.5;It's an honor to watch the great\NSleeping Kogoro at work firsthand!
0.5;Mori-kun! If the body\Nwas found right after she died,
0.5;these people couldn't\Npossibly have done it!
0.5;Besides, you were the one\Nwho insisted it was a suicide!
0.5;That was a lie meant\Nto throw the killer off guard.
0.5;Because we wouldn't want the\Nevidence to be destroyed, after all.
0.5;Yeah! Kogoro-ojisan asked me to\Nlook for strange blood on the floor!
0.5;It's hard to tell, since\Nit's mixed with other blood,
0.5;The shape that drops\Nof human blood make
0.5;is pretty much determined\Nby how far they fall.
0.5;The farther the fall,\Nthe larger the circle,
0.5;If you had carried\Nher by her arms and legs,
0.5;the distance from her toenails\Nto the floor was 50 cm at best.
0.5;However, these blood drops\Nclearly fell more than a meter.
0.5;Yes. The killer had carried her\Nto the top of the shelf last night...
0.5;...where she slept, with a rope around\Nher neck, tied to the roof beam.
0.5;That way, when she woke in the morning,\Nshe would lose her balance,
0.5;fall from the shelf,\Nand wind up hanging herself.
0.5;The loud sound right\Nafter she was hanged
0.5;was from the pots\Nleft directly below the noose.
0.5;Of course, this was also meant\Nto hasten the body's discovery
0.5;and solidify the alibi of\Nthe killer inside the stateroom.
0.5;Then what about\Nthe cut on her right calf?
0.5;Look closely at the top of the shelf.\NDo you see a protruding nail?
0.5;When she lost her balance and fell,\Nshe likely cut her calf on that nail.
0.5;The blood landed on a\Ndifferent spot on the floor
0.5;probably because she had held\Non to the shelf for a few seconds.
0.5;Meaning she just happened\Nto get the cut on her calf?
0.5;He was probably quite\Nshocked when he saw her cut.
0.5;But the killer would've quickly\Ndiscovered the cause of it,
0.5;Even if the body swung, the shelf\Nwould still have been too far away.
0.5;Fearing his trick would be\Nfigured out if this blood was found,
0.5;Isn't that right, the one\Nwho left last night's party
0.5;to carry her to the storeroom\Nand set up this trick...
0.5;with a great detective\Nlike you around?!
0.5;Because she had\Nbroken the Fusui-maru.
0.5;To make this murder look\Nlike a suicide that she committed
0.5;because of her own\Nmishandling of things?!
0.5;If she was in charge\Nof selling these works,
0.5;she would've been the one\Nwho stored and removed them here.
0.5;So she was bound\Nto drop it eventually.
0.5;Moreover, she fell\Nasleep drunk during the party.
0.5;Please knock this off! You shouldn't\Nblame me without any proof...
0.5;Actually, I believe\Nyou're still wearing the proof.
0.5;Now then, Inspector!\NPlease lift up the back of his jacket!
0.5;That most likely got there while\Nyou were carrying her up the shelf.
0.5;You'd have to carry her on your\Nshoulders to use the ladder, after all.
0.5;And then you returned to the stateroom,\Nas if nothing had happened.
0.5;You had left the party to carry\Nher here before she sobered up!
0.5;Have a look at the sitting\Ncushions in the stateroom.
0.5;One has a bit of the lipstick\Nhe brought back with him.
0.5;Come on, now!\NYes, this might be her lipstick.
0.5;But maybe she just\Nhappened to touch my back
0.5;I was drunk last night,\Nso I don't really remember,
0.5;but can you say\Nthat isn't a possibility?
0.5;You leave me no choice then.\NI'll show my trump card.
0.5;Hey, Conan!\NShow 'em what you found.
0.5;To make sure this murder\Nworked as planned.
0.5;there'd be no guarantee\Nshe'd lose her balance.
0.5;But it'd be a different story\Nif a phone under her pillow rang.
0.5;In that situation, most people\Nwould reach out without thinking.
0.5;Even more so if she used\Nher cell phone as an alarm clock.
0.5;Yes. Seto-san placed that\Npot in the shelf directly under her
0.5;and had the cell phone in this\Nspecial double-bottomed pot ring.
0.5;Checking the cell phone's\Nnumber should make it immediately clear
0.5;Tell me, detective.\NHow did you know it was me?
0.5;I thought so too when Conan\Nfound the pot with the phone in it.
0.5;After all, when you tried\Nto call her, you said this:
0.5;The cell phone was\Napparently turned off.
0.5;In such cases,\Na cell phone would reply
0.5;My suspicion was confirmed\Nonce I remembered that.
0.5;My suspicion that when you called,\Nyou called a different number.
0.5;But I can't believe you'd destroy\NMaster's Fusui-maru to kill her!
0.5;That thing can turn\Nto dust for all I care.
0.5;After all, it's a counterfeit\Ncopy I made of the real Fusui-maru.
0.5;Yeah. The real one is\Nstored in a different location.

0.5;She took my works and sold\Nthem to rich, artistic know-nothings,
0.5;By the time I realized it,\Nshe had already sold several dozen.
0.5;You should be thankful\Nmore than anything.
0.5;I'm actually selling the\Nunoriginal junk that you make!
0.5;I didn't want to harm\NMaster's name any further...
0.5;But she threatened to kick\Nme out if I didn't keep making stuff!
0.5;I couldn't put\Nup with it anymore, so...
0.5;Why didn't you tell\NMaster about it?! Surely he--
0.5;I couldn't tell him my fakes sold\Nfor more than his authentic works...
0.5;Oh! So that's the\Ncup worth 10 million yen?!

0.5;The deceased is Director\NTachibana of Itsui Electronics...
0.5;We all work under Director Tachibana\Nin Product Development.
0.5;He was going to be promoted\Nto head of the New York branch.
0.5;Tell me, do all the golf balls\Nhere have red lines on them?
0.5;Which means the red,\Ncrossed lines mark the bomb ball.
0.5;The question is, was this meant\Nspecifically for Director Tachibana,
0.5;Because all three of us here\Nhated him enough to kill him.
0.5;He had already taken credit\Nfor three of my product ideas,
0.5;and he always ignored you, no matter\Nhow many good ideas you had.
0.5;N-Not me! I had no\Nproblems with the director!
0.5;We all know he stole your\Ngirlfriend a long time ago!
0.5;N-No! She didn't get stolen!\NShe dumped me!
0.5;That's it! I know who killed\NDirector Tachibana, Inspector!
0.5;The killer mixed the bomb ball\Nwith other balls in the machine,
0.5;who got the golf balls\Nfor Director Tachibana?
0.5;Meanwhile, Minami-san\Nwas in the restroom,
0.5;and the Yasui guy\Nwas at his own machine.
0.5;No one else could've put\Nthe bomb ball in there but you!
0.5;I hear you shared some of\Nyour golf balls with the victim.
0.5;you could have put\Nthe bomb ball in there.
0.5;W-Wait!\NIf I did put it in there,
0.5;the last balls in\Nare the last ones out.
0.5;And you finished hitting\Nbefore Tachibana-san.
0.5;No! I just have a\Nhabit of hitting quickly!
0.5;The reason being that he was\Ncaught in the blast, as was Minami-san.
0.5;Was it because you saw the\Nred-lined ball come up and took cover?
0.5;Yes! The director liked to\Ndrink coffee after he finished hitting!
0.5;So I always went and ordered\Nit ten minutes before he finished!
0.5;But it seems a bit too convenient\Nthat you were gone when it blew up.
0.5;The old man's logic so far\Nhas been unusually consistent.
0.5;But if Yasui-san\Nreally was the killer...
0.5;You had a backup\Nready in case of a dud!
0.5;Boy, what an incredibly\Nsimple case this was!
0.5;Did Yasui-san not care if he got\Ncaught for killing Director Tachibana?
0.5;I just assumed the old man\Nhit the ball into a metal post.
0.5;Which means this was\Nthe ball Director Tachibana hit,
0.5;and that metallic\Nsound was when it hit a post.
0.5;Then what were\Nthose bomb ball fragments?
0.5;That's right, you're\Nnot the killer, Yasui-san.
0.5;We found a ball fragment\Nwith a fuse at the scene!
0.5;Yes, we did. But Inspector,\Ntake a look at this.
0.5;I found that ball by a\Nmetal post at the far end net.
0.5;It's not much, but it\Nshould smell of explosives.
0.5;Tachibana-san had hit\Nnot the red ball,
0.5;"The killer didn't place the bomb\Nball in Tachibana-san's machine;"
0.5;he planted it inside\Nthe driver head beforehand!
0.5;If there were fragments\Nleft over after the explosion,
0.5;everyone would simply\Nassume it was the ball that blew up.
0.5;the killer set down a\Npre-prepared fragment
0.5;Yasui-san. I believe you mentioned\Nthe director's driver repair fees?
0.5;Yes. The shaft had a crack in it,\Nso I had Minami send it for repairs.
0.5;I felt it best to turn it\Ninto a carbon shaft club.
0.5;That club was given to the director\Nby the current CEO fifteen years ago.
0.5;So the director\Nwas very attached to it...
0.5;So, when did you return\Nthe repaired club to Minami-san?
0.5;But you gave it to\Nthe director this morning!
0.5;Meaning the driver was in your\Npossession for an entire day and night.
0.5;What? Your stomach hurts?!\NWhat a wet blanket!
0.5;That was just one\Nof the steps of his plan.
0.5;Did you perhaps usually have\NMinami-san get your golf balls
0.5;and have him put ten or so in\NDirector Tachibana's own machine?
0.5;This time, he purposely said his\Nstomach hurt and fled to the restroom
0.5;Moreover, he planned to narrow\Ndown the suspects to just you,
0.5;by having you be away from\Nthe scene the instant of the explosion.
0.5;to completely clear\Nhimself of suspicion,
0.5;he stood nearby so that he\Nwould get caught in the explosion.
0.5;Okubo-san received injuries\Nto almost his entire body,
0.5;yet he only received injuries\Noutside his left elbow and leg.
0.5;It's because moments\Nbefore the explosion,
0.5;with his left arm\Nand hid behind a pillar.
0.5;as he was about\Nto move to New York.
0.5;But wasn't using the driver only\Nyou could've had in the last two days

0.5;The director who would\Nnever acknowledge my skill,
0.5;and Manager Yasui, who never\Ndid anything but suck up to him...
0.5;So I plotted to kill the director\Nand have him take the fall.
0.5;And you didn't care if anyone\Nelse died in the explosion?!
0.5;Had this golf range been crowded,\Neven more people would've--
0.5;I think he said that so I wouldn't\Nget caught in the explosion!

0.5;In other words, Otaro-san \Nwas one of the two culprits.

0.5;Which means we can't simply assume \NOtaro-san's death was an accident.
0.5;Was the witness in the seven \Nyear old case Miona-chan?
0.5;The witness in the seven year \Nold case was indeed Miona-chan,
0.5;I was assigned to the Haido \NCity station at the time.
0.5;He was watching to see if \Nshe'd regain her memory.
0.5;That's why Miona-chan was afraid of \Ndiscussions about the Masked Comet.
0.5;That case was the reason Masked \NComet Byun was canceled.

0.5;You said you were drinking while \Nplaying with a cow magnet yesterday.
0.5;Otaro-san left us a message \Ntelling us who killed him.
0.5;Since the Masked Comet was \Nso involved in this case,
0.5;but if you look at the position of his \Nhand, it's clear that it's reversed.
0.5;In other words, it's two lines \Nsticking out of a circle?
0.5;"Otaro-san expresses the \N""oh"" sound as a circle."
0.5;"The two lines are the \NKatakana symbol for ""ha."""

0.5;He had the Byun card to tell \Nyou he knew everything.
0.5;and dumped the body in the lake \Non your way to pick us up.
0.5;Then you killed Otaro-san in order \Nto frame him for the murder.
0.5;Then why did you lie about \NOtaro-san taking beers
0.5;It's not unusual to take a \Nbottle opener to drink beer.
0.5;You've been fooled by its appearance, \Njust like that blue beer.
0.5;The key to the door to happiness \Nthat Otaro-san described
0.5;opening a beer would be the same \Nas opening the door to happiness.
0.5;The upturned edges of caps on \Nthe floor are slightly pointed.
0.5;It's a product of the shape \Nof the bottle opener.
0.5;In order to make this a locked \Nroom, you needed a bottle opener.
0.5;In the dining room was the \Ncow magnet you played with
0.5;He had to remove them in order to \Nuse the cow magnet in his trick.
0.5;However, it would be \Nimpossible to put them back.

0.5;You know better than anyone \Nthat there's damning evidence
0.5;but since last night, you've \Nbeen wearing it on your wrist.
0.5;When you checked the time earlier, you looked \Nat the wall clock after looking at your watch.
0.5;However, Fujiyoshi-san discovered the \Nsituation in the dining room first,
0.5;you climbed down the tree next to the \Nsecond floor guest room and escaped.
0.5;So the magnetic force of the \Ncow magnet broke his watch.
0.5;he waited for an opportunity to \Ndrop it on the dining room floor.
0.5;Otaro-san must have resisted \Nwhen you tried to kill him.
0.5;He pushed you to the ground, pressing one of \Nthe bottle caps on the floor against your arm.
0.5;However, you didn't have time \Nto dispose of it very far away.
0.5;Furthermore, even if skin \Nor blood aren't found on it,

0.5;So they ran ahead\Nto the shopping street--
0.5;The killer eventually decided\Nto fake his death too.
0.5;You're pretty smart\Nfor a couple of kids.
0.5;Hiroshi-kun isn't back yet, either.\NWhat could they be doing?
0.5;Probably loitering around\Nsomewhere. Kids'll be kids.
0.5;This is all because you\Nwouldn't call the police!
0.5;But you're the one\Nwho wanted to come in here!
0.5;Stop worrying!\NThey'll come back! Kids'll be kids!
0.5;But what if something bad\Nhas happened to them?!
0.5;We should've been crushed\Nalong with that dead body,
0.5;Luckily, it led right\Ninto an underground tunnel...
0.5;Oh! That was your\Nconvenience store, wasn't it?
0.5;A dirty stockbroker tricked me,\Nand I racked up more debt
0.5;than I could ever pay off,\Nand my family ran out on me.
0.5;It was that\Nstockbroker that I killed.
0.5;My store was\Nrepossessed and shut down.
0.5;It wasn't as popular as stores\Non the shopping street--
0.5;He came to buy from\Nyour store for his first errand!
0.5;The very same Hiroshi-kun\Nthat you tried to kill...
0.5;A huge victory for the\NJunior Detective League!
0.5;Guess I'll have a bath, some booze,\Nand get some shut-eye!
0.5;Alright! Let's go,\NJunior Detective League!
0.5;What the heck am I doing?\NWhy am I stuck doing this?
0.5;This was a murder!\NMeaning the most suspicious person is--
0.5;--the guy on the phone\Nwho told her not to jump.
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut Osaka is even more so!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;We're checking into how\Nthese two victims are connected,
0.5;I don't know why, but they\Nwere both stabbed in the heart,
0.5;Correct, it was definitely\Nthe same person.
0.5;I dunno, it's no\Ndifferent from the Tokyo Tower...
0.5;Don't be dumb! Don't compare\Nthis with that tasteless red thing!
0.5;The Tsutenkaku and\Nthe new world all around it
0.5;Just a little longer!\NI'm waiting for someone!
0.5;I just thought I'd\Nshow you guys around Osaka!
0.5;But he winds up stabbing\Nand killing you instead!
0.5;The chief is busy in a\Nmeeting about the incidents.
0.5;I did just like you asked and\Nborrowed the Tojiri station's best one!
0.5;You can pass other\Ncars even in traffic jams!
0.5;Oh, I know! Should I turn on the siren?\NWe can go even faster!
0.5;It feels like we're being arrested,\Nso it's kind of embarrassing.
0.5;Oh, don't worry about that!\NYou haven't done anything wrong!
0.5;The soup's so clear\Nyou can see the bottom!
0.5;Oh, Heiji! Who's she?\NA new girlfriend?
0.5;Hmm, the next thing\NOsaka is famous for is...
0.5;Nothing... it just feels like\Nsomeone's been watching me...
0.5;I thought you were\Non a diet, Ran-neechan?
0.5;Okonomiyaki? Why didn't\Nyou say so before the takoyaki?
0.5;We're going the wrong way!\NWe can't get there on Midosuji!
0.5;In that case, shall I show\Nthem a nearby place I know?
0.5;Don't play dumb.\NI already know everything.
0.5;I know you're the Kudo broad\Nfrom Tokyo who's seducing him!
0.5;"Heiji and I were once\Nbound by ""chains of iron""!"
0.5;If you want to mess with Heiji,\Nyou gotta go through me--!
0.5;Then why didn't you\Nask Kudo to come too?
0.5;Don't be stupid!\NKudo's sitting right--!
0.5;Then we got stuck together when\NI pretended to be a policeman!
0.5;"It was lame;\Nwe found ourselves in big trouble!"
0.5;It was not lame! We had to bathe\Nand use the bathroom together!
0.5;To commemorate it, I put a piece\Nof the chain in here for good luck!
0.5;No, no! Heiji and I are just\Nchildhood friends!
0.5;I'm like his big sister\Nwho's always looking after him!
0.5;Her dad's chief detective of the\NOsaka police and my dad's friend,
0.5;so we've known each other\Nsince we were kids, that's all.
0.5;A detective runt and the\Ndaughter of a police detective...
0.5;I was acting as your\Nbig sister and keeping watch
0.5;so the creepy Tokyo girl\Nwon't try and seduce you!
0.5;No, no, I'm just\Nhere to show you around!
0.5;I don't know! He suddenly\Nfell onto the hood of the car!
0.5;Now you tell us why you dropped\Nthat body on top of a police car!
0.5;Yeah... someone called this guy\Nabout a strange man on the roof.
0.5;The body was wrapped in rope,\Nattached to the roof's handrail,
0.5;and covered with a tarp,\Nwhile the other end of the rope
0.5;I put his estimated time of\Ndeath at about one full day ago.
0.5;So someone murdered him this\Ntime yesterday and left him hanging.
0.5;but it could be someone\Ntrying to make an example...
0.5;This is clearly connected\Nwith those incidents...
0.5;It's all right.\NI got her license plate number.
0.5;"But never mind that.\NTell me about ""those incidents,"" Hattori!"
0.5;In each case, they were stabbed\Nin the chest, through their wallets.
0.5;After they were strangled\Nto death with something.
0.5;Maybe it was someone\Nwho held a grudge about money?
0.5;None of them had enough\Nmoney to incur someone's wrath.
0.5;In fact, none of them\Nare connected in any way.
0.5;They were all born, raised,\Nschooled, and employed in Osaka,
0.5;We found it, Heiji-kun!\NWe found a link between the victims!
0.5;Huh? Isn't this from Goshi Sotaro's\Ncorruption case six years ago?
0.5;The case where his secretary\Ntook responsibility for him and quit?
0.5;As I recall,\Nthe secretary's name was Nagao...
0.5;Nagao Hidetoshi,\Nthe first one who was killed!
0.5;But didn't you already\Ninvestigate this? Why now?
0.5;It seems he was Assemblyman\NGoshi's driver until four years ago.
0.5;His former secretary and\Nhis former driver...
0.5;Assemblyman Goshi\Nmay be involved in this.
0.5;We thought so too, so one of\Nmy seniors is headed to his place now.
0.5;Then what do you say\Nwe pay a visit too, Sakata-chan?
0.5;Hold on! You should\Nleave that to the police!
0.5;I can't just let the guy who screwed\Nup your Osaka tour get away!
0.5;A good luck charm I gave him.\NIt's always protected his life.
0.5;They're very important charms!\NThere are only two in the world!
0.5;Yeah, remember that story\Nabout us and the handcuffs?
0.5;I secretly put a piece of the\Nchain in his good luck charm!
0.5;Never mind that.\NI don't see the runt anywhere...
0.5;I guess this means\Nno more police cars...
0.5;You gotta write a letter apologizing\Nfor the crushed car, don't you?
0.5;the address and phone number\Nof that suspicious woman you saw.
0.5;She divorced last year and lives\Nalone in the West Side Apartments.
0.5;Yeah... it seemed\Nlike she knew something.
0.5;Here, I'll call to\Nsee if she's home or not.
0.5;The deceased was identified\Nas Noyasu Kazuto-san, age 41.
0.5;My name is Sakata,\NI'm with the Tojiri Police Department.
0.5;O-Officer! Hurry here and\Nprotect me! I'm going to be killed!
0.5;I'll tell you everything!\NJust hurry here! Hurry!
0.5;What now?! It's a one-way\Nroad and it's a heavy traffic day!
0.5;Hey! Lady! We're with that\Ncop who called earlier! Open up!
0.5;I just got off the one-way road,\Nso I'll be there in a few minutes.
0.5;And there's a knife\Nthrough her wallet and chest...
0.5;She was strangled to\Ndeath with a rope of some sort.
0.5;She appears to have been\Nstabbed after being strangled.
0.5;Three or four minutes\Nbefore you arrived.
0.5;This bathroom\Ncleaner guy found her.
0.5;But why does the killer\Nstab their wallets every time?
0.5;You told this lady not to go outside,\Nbut it looks like she died here.
0.5;Come to the Shinsai Bridge now\Nif you want to see some old friends.
0.5;See that? You're the\Nnext to wind up like that.
0.5;In other words,\Nthe lady heard the first message
0.5;Then, when she came back,\Nshe heard the second message
0.5;Could it refer to the\Npeople who've been killed so far?
0.5;Detective Sakata.\NThere's a call from headquarters.
0.5;Hey, Hattori. These answering\Nmachine messages are strange.
0.5;The times and the\Ncontents of the messages.
0.5;"There were only two minutes\Nbetween the ""come"" message"
0.5;Does that mean the\Nkiller was watching her?
0.5;Something's odd\Nabout these four murders.
0.5;Yikes! I just remembered that\Nominous dream from the other day!
0.5;There are no witnesses and it's\Nnot clear how they're all connected,
0.5;yet we can ID\Nthe victims easily enough.
0.5;The victims' names were on the\Nnews right after the first two killings.
0.5;All four had their driver's\Nlicenses in their stabbed wallets.
0.5;So all four have\Nclean driving records...
0.5;They also all got their licenses\Ndifferent years at different places.
0.5;Hey... it says Okazaki learned\Nto drive in Hyogo and not Osaka.
0.5;Oh, that place is famous\Nfor its cheap license school.
0.5;Do you have the number\Nfor that place, Mister?
0.5;Okazaki Sumie and Nishiguchi\NTayo shared a room at the school?!
0.5;Alright! We're starting\Nto connect the four victims now!
0.5;Okazaki-san got\Nher license that same year,
0.5;but Nishiguchi-san\Ngot his three years later.
0.5;Maybe he sucked at driving\Nand didn't graduate that year?
0.5;The others were at that\Nschool twenty years ago, too!
0.5;The first victim,\NNagao Hidetoshi-san,
0.5;There was also a man\Nwhose name is all too familiar now.
0.5;No question about it!\NIt's Numabuchi!
0.5;The faces and names\Nof the other five match, too!
0.5;...but only Okazaki-san\Nwent on to get her license.
0.5;Something happened at this\Nschool twenty years ago. Something...
0.5;involving that training\Nground twenty years ago.
0.5;Numabuchi, broke and in trouble,\Ndecided to use the old incident
0.5;to blackmail the assemblyman\Nout of money but was refused.
0.5;So he killed off everyone\Ninvolved in the incident
0.5;That, or Goshi used\NNumabuchi to kill off everyone
0.5;When Nagao-san and\NNoyasu-san quit working for him,
0.5;Mention the instructor's death\Nand his companions back then,
0.5;and I bet that cop-hater\Nwill start talking!
0.5;Conan-kun! What are you doing here?!\NYou suddenly disappeared!
0.5;Otaki-han from headquarters?!\NWhy are you here?!
0.5;Must be convenient, always having\Nthe cops at your beck and call!
0.5;Who're you to talk?! You were\Ntouring Osaka in a police car!
0.5;I can drive the boy to\Nthe chief's house if you'd like.
0.5;No! I wanna stay with\NHeiji-niichan!
0.5;But knowing you,\Nyou'll just find a way to butt in again.
0.5;In exchange, hold yourself\Nback as much as you can today.
0.5;When I come home,\NI'll tell you all about what happened!
0.5;Don't worry. I won't let\Nthem mess with Osaka anymore!
0.5;We'll be at the chief's house\Nin Neyagawa in half an hour...
0.5;Heiji's mom is making\Nblowfish stew tonight!
0.5;You found the car of\NNumabuchi, the fugitive,
0.5;Sorry, Mori-han, but you'll have to\Nwait longer for the blowfish stew.
0.5;Sorry! I'll have a youngster\Ncome get you in a minute.
0.5;Isn't Numabuchi that\Nmurderer who escaped with a gun?
0.5;Things have gotten really bad.\NRight, Conan--?
0.5;We found the car covered\Nin plants, but Numabuchi is still...
0.5;It was empty\Nwhen I peeked inside.
0.5;Maybe he ditched the car\Nand ran off somewhere else?
0.5;L-Little boy!\NWhen did you get here?!
0.5;I found these burned\Nat the bottom of this can.
0.5;and stickers from lots of convenience\Nstore lunches that expire today.
0.5;Not many people would\Neat convenience store lunches
0.5;But, boy, if a wanted man\Nshowed up at a convenience store...
0.5;No! There are signs that someone\Nlived here awhile ago, but...
0.5;That pillar and those\Nbeams are free of cobwebs...
0.5;I see! He stood\Non the windowsill and...
0.5;Oh?! It looks like\Nthis leads to the attic!
0.5;Numabuchi Kiichiro! You're under\Narrest for robbery and murder!
0.5;No, he's kept us waiting\Nin here since this evening.
0.5;Forget 'em. They'll give\Nup and leave eventually.
0.5;Shall I at least tell them about\Nthe phone call with the strange voice?
0.5;Let's make a deal in one hour\Nabout the incident twenty years ago.
0.5;Go out the back gate\Nand wait in the far storehouse.
0.5;Sheesh! I told you to stop\Nscampering around, Conan-kun!
0.5;Conan-kun! Hang in there!\NConan-kun!
0.5;It must be thanks to the good\Nluck charm Heiji-niichan lent me!
0.5;See? The knife got caught in\Nthe chain link, so it couldn't stab me!
0.5;Why does he have two\Nhandcuffs on his left hand?
0.5;We had to get him free, so we cut\Nthe chain and put our cuffs on him.
0.5;Looks like you were right\Nabout someone bringing him food, kid.
0.5;Wait all you want,\Nold man Goshi won't come.
0.5;Sakata-han. You're the\Nserial murderer, aren't you?!
0.5;I was just admiring how\Nunusual this storehouse is!
0.5;First, when the\Nbody fell onto the cop car...
0.5;Mere moments before we exited\Nthe restaurant, you made a call
0.5;Then, while I was on the roof,\Nyou called Okazaki-san to the scene,
0.5;left a threatening call on her\Nmachine when you knew she was gone,
0.5;and led her to\Nhole up in her apartment.
0.5;After you had me witness her\Nand made an impression on her,
0.5;you brought up the topic and\Ncalled her after passing her apartment.
0.5;Then, after I heard her\Nfrightened voice and leapt from the car,
0.5;you parked the car in an alley\Nand called her again while chasing me.
0.5;I'm the detective who just called!\NYou're in danger there!
0.5;Please wait in the nearby\Npublic restroom! Got it?!
0.5;And then, while we were in her room,\Nyou killed her in the restroom!
0.5;You were able to arrive by\Ncar immediately after she was found
0.5;because you had rented\Ntwo cars of the exact same model!
0.5;After you killed her, you got in\Nthe other rental car that was nearby
0.5;to make it look like you'd\Njust gotten there after some time.
0.5;You drove for us and got us\Ncloser to the heart of the case
0.5;to get everyone here so you\Ncould kill old man Goshi!
0.5;He's a prefectural assemblyman.\NHe'd stand out if he left his home.
0.5;And he could even\Ntake bodyguards with him.
0.5;But if you came here with us,\Nyou could wander around freely.
0.5;The rental cars' side-view\Nmirrors were the first thing.
0.5;It was at a different\Nangle the second time.
0.5;And then I noticed the instructor\Nin the picture from twenty years ago
0.5;It was your habit in the\Ncar that finally convinced me.
0.5;the same way Noyasu-san\Nand Okazaki-san did!
0.5;That's proof you'd all been\Ninvolved with the same person.
0.5;I don't know what\Nhappened twenty years ago,
0.5;but shouldn't you turn\Nyourself in, Sakata-han?
0.5;That's right! Numabuchi\Ntold us everything!
0.5;After he committed the murders,\Nhe planned to frame Numabuchi
0.5;There, it's empty!\NNow you can't do anything stupid!
0.5;N-Never mind me,\NHeiji-kun... Hurry and escape!
0.5;and was always telling my\Nmother to check the rear-view mirror.
0.5;Do you think someone\Nlike that would drive drunk?!
0.5;...to expose the\Ntruth of my father's death!
0.5;I solved the mystery when I found\NNumabuchi in a mountain shack.
0.5;I look like my father, so the instant\Nhe saw me, he grew frightened
0.5;F-Forgive me, Instructor Inaba!\NIt was just a prank!
0.5;when we forced you to drink\Nand drive a car without brake fluid!
0.5;And then you went after all\Nsix people who took part in it?
0.5;The statute of limitations\Nfor murder is fifteen years.
0.5;So I decided that if the\Nlaw can't punish them, I would!
0.5;You're a cop! You're the only\Nones in Japan allowed to carry guns!
0.5;You put the cherry blossom\Nemblem on your notebook to shame!
0.5;They took him away in\Nanother ambulance just now.
0.5;He's really something. He carried\Nyou out of that fire, on his back.
0.5;Is this the homicidal\Nmaniac who tried to kill me?!
0.5;When I do, we can talk about\Nwhat happened twenty years ago.
0.5;Next episode airs on October 12th.\NRead a copy of Shonen Sunday...
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;A-Actually, Mifuyu... My friend \Nwas stabbed by her boyfriend!
0.5;Is this really where your friend \Nwas stabbed in the chest and died?
0.5;And over here there are footprints \Nleading in from and out to the balcony.
0.5;Are you certain the deceased is the resident \Nof this apartment, Morita Mifuyu-san?
0.5;We worked together at the \Nbakery by the station.
0.5;She heard the window \Nbreak and someone scream,
0.5;So Ayano-san, who had been told \Nwhere the spare key was hidden,
0.5;where she saw Mifuyu-san \Nwith a knife in her chest,
0.5;So the culprit was still \Nhiding on the balcony then.
0.5;I'm working hard to save \Nmoney so I can do that.
0.5;he said he was having trouble with \Na client and needed money urgently.
0.5;But Tabata-san, not realizing \NI was Mifuyu's friend,
0.5;When I told Mifuyu about it, \Nshe said she would sue him.
0.5;we found this piece of paper \Nin the trash can here.
0.5;It wouldn't be impossible to \Nenter and exit from this height.
0.5;Tabata entered the room from the \Nbalcony by breaking the window,
0.5;and murdered Mifuyu-san by \Nstabbing her with a knife.
0.5;However, before he could move \Nthe body, Ayano-san arrived.
0.5;So he hid on the balcony, and \Nwhile Ayano-san was gone,
0.5;he put the body in the \Nsuitcase and took it away.
0.5;Canvas the area to see if anyone saw \Na suspicious man carrying a suitcase.
0.5;They seem to be the same as the \Nones in Mifuyu-san's apartment.
0.5;And these tracks are from \Nthe wheels on the suitcase.
0.5;Tabata must've put the body in \Nthe suitcase and brought it here.
0.5;The blood must've gotten on them \Nwhen he murdered Mifuyu-san.
0.5;It may have been in the \Ncoffee left on the table.
0.5;Find something we can use to \Nidentify Tabata's handwriting.
0.5;So he regretted murdering \NMifuyu-san and killed himself.
0.5;Tabata must've dumped Mifuyu-san's \Nbody on the way here.
0.5;We'll head back to identify the \Nhair and search for the body.
0.5;What's wrong? Is there \Nsomething bothering you?
0.5;And Tabata-san used his coffee \Nset for guests to drink coffee.
0.5;There was a mug he probably used \Non a regular basis on the counter.
0.5;You mean it wasn't suicide because \Nthey murdered Tabata instead?
0.5;There's a suicide note written \Nin Tabata's handwriting.
0.5;Does that really mean he \Nmeant to commit suicide?
0.5;Maybe Tabata-san really did just mean \Nthat he would go to see Mifuyu-san.
0.5;And maybe it was used to \Nlook like a suicide note.
0.5;And made to look like he killed \NMifuyu-san and then killed himself.
0.5;Which means it had been some time \Nsince the footprints got on the floor.
0.5;It doesn't make sense that \Nthe culprit broke the window
0.5;and attacked Mifuyu-san \Nwhen Ayano-san arrived.
0.5;"and Mifuyu-san scream, \N""Please stop, Tabata-san."""
0.5;then she wouldn't have \Ntaken us to that apartment.
0.5;The culprit made footprints \Non the floor beforehand,
0.5;waited for Ayano-san to \Narrive to break the window,
0.5;before stabbing her and \Nhiding on the balcony.
0.5;No, I don't think there \Nwas anyone on the balcony.
0.5;But Ayano-san heard the culprit \Nmake noise on the balcony.
0.5;They made a noise so Ayano-san would \Nthink the culprit was on the balcony
0.5;There were crumbs on top \Nof the air conditioner.
0.5;There's only one person who could've \Nprepared all of that beforehand.
0.5;There's something written \Nunder today's date...
0.5;Someday I'd like to open \Na bakery café in Paris.
0.5;The 293 on the note thrown \Naway in your apartment
0.5;was the flight number of \Nyour Paris-bound flight.
0.5;She's at the France Fair \Ncafé in the departure lobby.
0.5;Isn't that pain from the wound \Nyou inflicted on yourself?
0.5;So you could put blood on the floor, the knife, \Nand the shoes you used to make the footprints.
0.5;There wasn't enough blood for \Nsomeone stabbed in the chest.
0.5;You left the bloodstained shoes and \Nsuitcase with the hair inside it.
0.5;Then you murdered Tabata-san and \Nmade it look like a suicide.
0.5;After investigating the \Nlate Tabata-san's home,
0.5;We checked with his bank, who told us \Nten million yen had been withdrawn.
0.5;but you actually plan to get \Nwith another woman, don't you?
0.5;How long are you going to keep \Npretending to be the good girl?
0.5;But if he'd just stolen \Nmy money and disappeared,
0.5;Because you snitched on him, \NI had to get my revenge!
0.5;A woman that beautiful\Ncan change so suddenly.
0.5;Come to think of it, didn't \Nwe leave to get lunch?
0.5;Excuse me, but you're the great \Ndetective Mori Kogoro, aren't you?
0.5;In that case, why don't \Nwe get dinner somewhere?
0.5;We were just talking about \Ngetting some French!
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NTruths of the Locked Room Revealed!"""
0.5;I need more than one drink after all \Nthe unbelievably hard work I did today.
0.5;When the countdown reaches zero, use your \Ndetective skills to produce an answer!
0.5;The victim is Kitasono Seiho-san, \Nseventy-two years old.
0.5;He died when he was struck \Nin the back of the head.
0.5;We believe the weapon was \Nthe plaster bust over there.
0.5;Seiho-san was famous in the \Nworld of Japanese painting.
0.5;He acted as the chairperson on judging \Ncommittees for various exhibitions.
0.5;His body was found by his \Napprentice Higashio Kengo-san.
0.5;It was around 3:50 PM when \NHigashio-san entered the studio
0.5;Higashio-san then left the studio \Nand returned to the house,
0.5;where he reported what he found \Nto housekeeper Minamida Shizu-san.
0.5;At the same time, Seiho-san's \Nwife Kinuko-san returned home.
0.5;Later, his other apprentice \NNishiyama Daiki-san arrived.
0.5;so I don't know how long \NNishiyama-san was painting there.
0.5;In any case, Kitasono-sensei wasn't someone \Nanyone would've hated enough to kill.
0.5;But, Higashio-san, aren't you \Nthe one who killed my husband?
0.5;You resented him for not \Nrecommending you
0.5;for the teaching position \Nat the Beika Art School.
0.5;In that case, weren't you \Nfighting with your husband
0.5;over the money you were \Nthrowing at a young host?
0.5;Maybe you killed him because \Nyou couldn't afford it.
0.5;When Higashio-san arrived, the \Ndoor wasn't locked, correct?
0.5;but on days like today when he knew we \Nwere coming, he sometimes left it open.
0.5;According to forensics, \Nthe windows were unlocked.
0.5;He did sometimes work \Nwith the windows open.
0.5;if a stranger entered through \Nthe door or windows.
0.5;By the way, was there anything \Nvaluable in the studio?
0.5;I'm not sure if they were valuable, but my \Nhusband kept a few of his paintings there.
0.5;At the very least, they'd \Nprobably sell for a few million.
0.5;His larger pieces are worth \Nclose to ten million.
0.5;during the estimated time of \Ndeath between 3:10 and 3:40,
0.5;I ate at the Beika department store and \Nvisited two other department stores after that.
0.5;I was on the train from \NLake Okuho to Beika City.
0.5;I left just before three to go \Nshopping at the nearby supermarket.
0.5;I returned about five minutes \Nbefore Higashio-san arrived.
0.5;Do you have anything or anyone \Nto verify your alibis?
0.5;Yeah. You already finished \Nthe painting of us.
0.5;Yeah. I was late coming here \Nbecause I was working on that.
0.5;Detective, this is a picture \NI took at Lake Okuho Station.
0.5;It's certainly clear that you took \Nit at Lake Okuho Station, but...
0.5;If it'd included the time, it \Nwould've verified your alibi.
0.5;If you enlarge the sign \Nbehind Nishiyama-san...
0.5;In any case, we're also considering\Nthe possibility of theft as we investigate,
0.5;but to be on the safe side, \Nwe're checking everyone's alibi.
0.5;We remember when he asked \Nus to be his models.
0.5;Since he has the painting \Nand photos of the station,
0.5;After canvassing the Mitsuboshi and Marukawa \Ndepartment stores you claimed you visited,
0.5;Naturally, we checked the \Nsecurity camera footage as well,
0.5;but we couldn't find you \Nanywhere during that time.
0.5;why don't you tell us where and \Nwhat you were actually doing?
0.5;but the deliveryman who came to your \Nplace said no one answered the door.
0.5;I don't like to be seen in my \Npajamas, so I didn't answer.
0.5;That sign that shows the destinations \Nchanged the moment the train started moving.
0.5;Sir, when does the sign switch \Nto showing the next destination?
0.5;It changes automatically when \Nthe previous train departs.
0.5;After all, Japan has the most \Npunctual trains in the world.
0.5;We were able to confirm the \Nhousekeeper Shizu-san's alibi.
0.5;We learned his wife Kinuko-san was visiting \Na male host around that time, too.
0.5;We're just waiting for confirmation \Non Higashio-san and Nishiyama-san.
0.5;I'll let you know the \Nmoment I learn anything.
0.5;By the way, I've been \Nwondering since yesterday.
0.5;We're first-years at \NTeitan Elementary School.
0.5;Since his alibi's been \Nverified, we can go now.
0.5;What? We came all the way here, \Nand we're leaving already?
0.5;I'll buy you something while \Nwe're waiting to transfer.
0.5;Since we're in the mountains, \Nthey'll have wild eel.
0.5;I get to be interrogated \Nby a beautiful detective.
0.5;In other words, if the same thing happened \Nwhen Nishiyama-san took that photo,
0.5;Forensics is saying there are no signs \Nsomeone entered from outside the house.
0.5;Yeah. Were there any trains \Nthat departed late?
0.5;but the gates at the crossing just \Noutside the station wouldn't descend.
0.5;When the conductor examined it, he found \Nsomeone had vandalized the crossing gate.
0.5;Earlier you said the sign \Nchanges automatically
0.5;when it's time for the \Nprevious train to leave.
0.5;Does that mean the sign changed to 2:02 PM \Nwhile the previous train was late?
0.5;Could you look up what time the delayed \Ntrain arrived in Aohata Station?
0.5;The train scheduled to arrive \Nat 1:50 arrived at 1:53.
0.5;He couldn't have painted this \Nin the less than two hours
0.5;between when he started and \Nwhen he got on the 1:17 train.
0.5;He probably accidentally \Ngot some paint on it.
0.5;Mister, this dog was tied to \Nthis tree yesterday, right?
0.5;so a crew from town hall \Ncut it down last week.
0.5;Around what time did you take \Nyour dog home yesterday?
0.5;I went home to eat lunch, \Nso it was around 12:30.
0.5;Yes. This is how Nishiyama-san \Nfabricated his alibi.
0.5;and painted us on top of the \Nscenery he'd already painted.
0.5;But there was something there \Nthat shouldn't have been:
0.5;vandalized the crossing \Ngate, and delayed the train.
0.5;He waited for the sign to \Nchange and took a photo.
0.5;But since he actually \Nboarded the 1:17 PM train,
0.5;he was able to board the 1:55 PM \Nspecial express at Aohata Station.
0.5;That train would let him arrive at the \Nstudio in time to commit the murder.
0.5;We don't know his motive, but if \Nhe did all that work beforehand,
0.5;then Nishiyama Daiki-san definitely \Nkilled Kitasono Seiho-san.
0.5;He made people pay in exchange \Nfor selecting them as winners.
0.5;Nishiyama-san, why did you \Ndecide to become a painter?
0.5;Didn't you become an artist so the children \Nwho saw your paintings would smile?
0.5;But you betrayed the children \Nwho modeled for you.
0.5;You deceived your audience and stooped \Nto using them to commit a murder.
0.5;Yeah, we wanted you to know \Nwithout us telling you.
0.5;Japan has the most punctual \Ntrains in the world.

0.5;But we're on the 2nd floor!\NHow'd he get up here?
0.5;He must've used that tree\Nto climb onto the veranda!
0.5;That's odd--\Nit's pouring outside!
0.5;Let's all wait in the\Ndining room until morning.
0.5;I hate piggyback rides!\NThey're so stupid!
0.5;What are you talking about?\NYou sprained your ankle!
0.5;Chikako-san was\Nwearing around her neck?
0.5;Right after you and the others\Nchased after the bandaged man,
0.5;Killing Chikako and\Nattacking Ran-chan twice!
0.5;He carried Chikako-san\Ninto the forest afterward,
0.5;so if her choker did fall off,\Nit would've been there.
0.5;So what was it doing\Nby the front door?
0.5;Why didn't you use your karate\Nto beat him up when he attacked you?
0.5;"I couldn't help it; I'm scared\Nof monsters and stuff like that..."
0.5;There's six of us,\Nand one of him.
0.5;I doubt he's dumb\Nenough to attack six--
0.5;"You're just a kid;\Nyou don't count!"
0.5;He protected me\Nwhen I was attacked!
0.5;Say, Ran. Did you get\Na look at the guy's face?
0.5;I couldn't see his face since\Nit was wrapped in bandages,
0.5;but I know his figure because\Nof when I jumped onto him...
0.5;Like we can believe\Nwhat some kid says.
0.5;I'm pretty sure he was recording\Nwhen the bandaged man
0.5;Just as I thought,\Nshe has the choker on!
0.5;Which means that her body,\Nwhich the bandaged man
0.5;was holding when they\Npassed by the window,
0.5;Someone inside this lodge\Ncould have carried her
0.5;through the house\Nand out into the forest.
0.5;But everyone was in this room\Nwhen she was taken!
0.5;Say. You were the last one\Nto see Chikako-san, right?
0.5;she read a note that had been\Nslipped beneath her door...
0.5;Ah, so she was drawn\Noutside by that note!
0.5;And only someone on the inside\Ncould have put the note there.
0.5;Does that mean the killer\Nis in this room?!
0.5;But why did he try\Nto kill Ran twice?
0.5;I don't know his motive\Nfor killing Chikako-san,
0.5;you opened everyone's door\Nby accident, right?
0.5;Don't tell me\Nthis kid suspects us?!
0.5;"Don't pay attention to him;\Nhe just loves playing detective!"
0.5;something's been\Nbugging me ever since...

0.5;The floor's covered\Nin broken glass!
0.5;The bandaged man must've\Nbroken through this window...
0.5;If he really did break in\Nthrough this window...
0.5;Most likely, he unlocked it\Nfrom the inside,
0.5;stepped onto the veranda,\Nclosed the window,
0.5;and then smashed it to make it\Nlook like he broke in from outside!
0.5;He snuck in from\Nthe 2nd floor again?!
0.5;Yeah, he probably jumped\Nonto the veranda from that tree...
0.5;and attacked Ran three times\Nis in this very room!
0.5;But why is the bandaged man\Nintent on killing Ran?
0.5;They were all changing clothes\Nso I shut the doors right away!
0.5;the reason why the bandaged\Nman passed by the window
0.5;with Chikako-san\Nfor everyone to see,
0.5;how he was able to carry the body\Ninto the forest unnoticed,
0.5;Ran's the only detective\NI can use here!
0.5;Say, where are the candles\NI gave you earlier?
0.5;Damn! I have no choice\Nbut to use Sonoko now!
0.5;What're you talking about,\NSonoko-chan?
0.5;The killer's obviously\Nthat bandaged guy!
0.5;Yeah. He's probably\Nin the forest right now,
0.5;Do you really think there's\Nsuch a person in the forest?
0.5;Think back to the state of Ran's\Nroom when she was attacked...
0.5;Yeah. He jumped onto the\Nupstairs veranda from a tree.
0.5;Then why were there no\Nmud tracks in Ran's room?
0.5;It was raining outside\Nwhen the bandaged man snuck in.
0.5;It was because the bandaged\Nman was inside the lodge!
0.5;The point of entry was most likely\NChikako-san's room, right next to Ran's.
0.5;The killer exited onto the veranda,\Nentered Ran's room, and attacked her.
0.5;...and he hastily ran\Nback to Chikako-san's room!
0.5;and met everyone in Ran's room\Nwith feigned unawareness.
0.5;Sonoko-chan. Playing\Ndetective is nice and all,
0.5;When the bandaged dude\Nran past the window,
0.5;every one of us\Nwas inside the lodge!
0.5;it'd be possible to make it\Nseem that way from inside!
0.5;He affixed Chikako-san's\Nbody to the dummy,
0.5;and attached two piano wires\Nto the dummy's head.
0.5;He passed one wire through\Nthe central veranda's railing,
0.5;tied both ends of the wires to the\Nrailing above the window in question,
0.5;and then cut the wire\Nthat went through the railing.
0.5;After he swung it\Npast the window,
0.5;he quickly recovered\Nthe dummy and Chikako-san!
0.5;The only one who\Ncould've pulled that off
0.5;was the person on the veranda,\Nfixing the roof...
0.5;You're kidding, right,\NSonoko-chan?
0.5;The two distinct piano wire\Nmarks on the outside railing...
0.5;Only the stage manager\Nfor your old filmmaking club
0.5;could've set up\Nsomething so elaborate!
0.5;Then what did I do with\Nthe body after I pulled it up?
0.5;Right after that, we all\Nchased him into the forest,
0.5;where we found\NChikako's body in pieces.
0.5;There is proof\Nthat you carried her.
0.5;My sister found Chikako-san's\Nchoker by the door.
0.5;She was wearing that choker\Nwhen she was abducted.
0.5;The fact that it was by the\Nfront door after everyone left
0.5;means that someone went through\Nthe door, carrying her body!
0.5;I already told you,\NI wasn't carrying anything!
0.5;Besides, nobody could carry\Nthe body without being noticed...
0.5;After all, all that we\Nsaw outside the window
0.5;Her body had been\Ntorn apart when we found it...
0.5;Why would I want to\Nkill her and Ran-chan?!
0.5;You and the bandaged man\Nhave completely different figures...
0.5;Takahashi!\NWhy didn't you say so?
0.5;He was afraid of what\NI would ask in response:
0.5;That's right.\NHe's not fat at all!
0.5;He stuffed the head in his\Nshirt and carried it out!
0.5;First, he lured Chikako-san\Ninto the forest, ripped her apart,
0.5;replaced the padding under\Nhis shirt with her head,
0.5;Then, after doing\Nthe trick on the veranda,
0.5;he stuffed the deflated dummy\Nand head under his shirt
0.5;and headed for the forest\Nwith everyone else.
0.5;Then he dumped\Nthe head in the forest
0.5;In other words, this was\Na daring and clever trick
0.5;in which he faked his figure\Nto freely move the corpse around!
0.5;By using this trick,\Nhe was able to make it look like
0.5;the bandaged man took Chikako-san\Ninto the forest and killed her,
0.5;and that he was responsible\Nfor everything that happened!
0.5;began to mess up\Nwhen Ran did something...
0.5;Yes. When she accidentally\Nopened his door,
0.5;but if she did remember,\Nhis carefully-planned murder plot
0.5;That's why he attacked\Nher in the forest--
0.5;Worried that Chikako-san\Nwould go down the mountain
0.5;he cut the phone line,\Ndestroyed the bridge,
0.5;He lured Chikako-san\Ninto the forest as planned
0.5;that he most likely\Nslipped under her door.
0.5;It was probably about\Nfellow club member Atsuko-san,
0.5;who committed suicide\Ntwo years ago--
0.5;It's true!\NI did it all for Atsuko!
0.5;She secretly showed me\Na story she had written,
0.5;and her eyes sparkled as she told\Nme her dream of being a novelist.
0.5;Then, one day, she hanged\Nherself in our meeting room!
0.5;"Once I saw Chikako's\Nlatest movie, ""Blue Kingdom,"""
0.5;That's right. The story\Nfor Chikako's debut work
0.5;"was exactly the same as the ""Azure\NCountry"" story that Atsuko showed me!"
0.5;Yeah. The story won Chikako\Na new scriptwriter's award
0.5;while she was still in school,\Nand now she's famous!
0.5;But how do we know\Nthat led to Atsuko's suicide?
0.5;The day Chikako won the award--\Nthe day before Atsuko died--
0.5;that she couldn't trust\Nanyone anymore!
0.5;So I lured Chikako into\Nthe forest with a blackmail note
0.5;That's what she gets\Nfor crushing Atsuko's dream!
0.5;I'm going to live\Nwith her in the next world
0.5;as the messenger of\Njustice who avenged her!
0.5;Maybe you did commit\Na crime for Atsuko's sake.

0.5;Yellow and pink... \NThat's distinctive clothing.
0.5;but we also need to get \Nthis cat to a hospital.
0.5;The rhythm of my detective \Nskills is perfect!
0.5;An odd restaurant with characters \Nplucked from a novel!
0.5;The Detective Boys take \Non a serial murder case!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;The victim was Bocchan Restaurant employee \NKoga Ushio-san, thirty-six years old.
0.5;The weapon hasn't been found, but is \Nmost likely a kitchen knife-like blade.
0.5;Judging by the body's condition, he \Nwas killed last night around midnight.
0.5;Try not to get in our way by \Nwalking around the crime scene.
0.5;This morning, Bocchan Restaurant \Nmanager Akazawa Zenichi-san,
0.5;whose home is located here at the \Nrestaurant, discovered the body.
0.5;It's possible that cat happened to be \Nhere at the crime scene last night.
0.5;Since their crime had been witnessed, \Nthey intended to silence him.
0.5;Then we should find the culprit \Nfor that cat's sake, too.
0.5;Regarding the criminal profile, since the murder \Noccurred within the restaurant late at night,
0.5;it's hard to imagine that it \Nwas committed by an outsider.
0.5;So it's likely that the murder was committed \Nby someone who works at Bocchan Restaurant.
0.5;The culprit is probably someone \Nwho works at the restaurant.
0.5;Bocchan's sense of justice is \Nthis old Kiyo's pride and joy.
0.5;You make it seem like \NI'm the reason for this.
0.5;I'd never do anything as \Nsenseless as kill someone.
0.5;You're always afraid to \Nrock the boat, Tanuki.
0.5;Bocchan Restaurant recreates the \Nworld inside a novel, doesn't it?
0.5;"""Bocchan"" is a famous novel written \Nduring the Meiji Era by Natsume Soseki."
0.5;But his students pull pranks on him, \Nlike putting grasshoppers in his bed.
0.5;Meanwhile, he learns that his colleague \NUranari-kun's fiancée, Madonna-san,
0.5;has been taken from him \Nby head teacher Red Shirt.
0.5;The righteous Bocchan is \Nunable to forgive them,
0.5;so he and his colleague Yama \NArashi-san beat up Red Shirt
0.5;You get to wear those pretty clothes \Nwhile bringing customers their food.
0.5;Since we're temporarily closed, \Nthey could let us leave.
0.5;The police insist we stay \Nso they can question us.
0.5;I do appreciate not having \Nto buy my own lunch.
0.5;You and the victim Uranari-san, or \NKoga Ushio, were romantic rivals.
0.5;You fought over Toyama \NChiaki-san, who plays Madonna.
0.5;He was responsible for all \Nof our reception staff.
0.5;What kind of manager would murder \Nthe backbone of his business?
0.5;You invited Uranari-san over and \Nasked him to leave Madonna-san alone.
0.5;But he wouldn't listen, so without \Nthinking, you stabbed him.
0.5;After all, Red Shirt is a dastardly fellow \Nwho will do anything to get his way.
0.5;If you think I did it, I'd \Nlike to see some evidence.
0.5;Did they both harbor \Nromantic feelings for me?
0.5;in front of our customers as \Npart of our business strategy.
0.5;It must be shocking to learn that \Ntwo men were fighting over her.
0.5;Not only that, but if a murder \Nwas committed because of it...
0.5;Come to think of it, what was \Nshe about to say earlier?
0.5;is a good-natured man who \Ncares for his employees.
0.5;Bocchan is actually a twisted \Nman with no sense of justice.
0.5;and he often yelled at his subordinates \Nas the head receptionist.
0.5;Naturally, everyone working in customer \Nservice strongly disliked him.
0.5;So they're nothing like their \Ncharacters from the novel.
0.5;Inspector, that means the culprit is \None of the good guys from the novel!
0.5;Not just Red Shirt, but Bocchan and Yama \NArashi had motives for murder, too.
0.5;We're lucky you happened to come \Nstay at my place last night.
0.5;You were able to confirm \Ntheirs, too? Which means...
0.5;We haven't been able to verify \Nlast night's alibis for...
0.5;And we're suspects because \Nof that? Unbelievable.
0.5;We received testimony that those \Nthree without alibis hated Uranari.
0.5;it's possible that someone mentioned \Na desire to kill Uranari.
0.5;I have no choice but to work as hard \Nas I can in order to pay it off.
0.5;So I'm clinging to this job \Nto get back at my dead mom.
0.5;to let me play Madonna \Ninstead of Yama Arashi.
0.5;Even if you don't like your \Nrole, you just have to do it.
0.5;That's not what I meant. \NI had a younger sister.
0.5;When she learned about this restaurant, \Nshe said she wanted to work here.
0.5;But six months ago, she died from an \Nillness called subarachnoid hemorrhaging.
0.5;I thought I could work here in her \Nplace, so I asked them to hire me.
0.5;I guess there's no need to keep \Nup the act in front of a child.
0.5;Naturally, I knew that \Neveryone hated Uranari-kun.
0.5;But you need people like \Nthat to manage a business.
0.5;Because he understood that, \Nhe played the unlikable role.
0.5;Opening Bocchan Restaurant has \Nbeen my dream since I was young.
0.5;I worked really hard to \Ngather enough capital.
0.5;I can't believe I developed \Na romantic rivalry at my age.
0.5;Is the culprit one of \Nthose three or Red Shirt?
0.5;"""I offer my own death as an \Napology to the man I killed."""
0.5;Inspector, this was found on \Nthe altar in Red Shirt's home!
0.5;That's probably the weapon \Nused in Uranari's murder.
0.5;he realized he couldn't escape his \Nguilt, so he took his own life.
0.5;Who started saying it was Bocchan and \NYama Arashi during the investigation?
0.5;You mean she thinks it's because she was \Ntrying to fulfill her sister's wish.
0.5;then why leave the murder \Nweapon on the altar?
0.5;but once he decided to kill himself, \Nhe left it there by way of apology.
0.5;And why didn't he write his \Nnote on a piece of paper?
0.5;They knocked him out and \Nhanged him by the neck.
0.5;to frame Red Shirt for the \Nmurder of Uranari-san.
0.5;If that's true, then they \Nmust have left some evidence.
0.5;There are drops of water on the leaves \Nof the branch beneath it, too.
0.5;You're getting in the way of \Nthe adults! Get out of here!
0.5;If Conan-kun is right, then the \Nculprit is one of those three.
0.5;We still don't know that \Nthe suicide was faked.
0.5;If he could speak to us, we could \Nask him who the culprit is.
0.5;He was beaten all over, and \Ntwo of his legs were broken.
0.5;That cat was attacked not at \NBocchan Restaurant, but near here.
0.5;The crime actually took \Nplace here two nights ago!
0.5;And Red Shirt's suicide was \Nalso a disguised murder!
0.5;Judging by the strength of the \Nforce applied to his neck,
0.5;A powerful force was applied \Nto his neck? That means...
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Welcome \Nto Bocchan Restaurant, Part Two!"""
0.5;As a reward, you can each have one \Nbook of your choice from the store.
0.5;Even heaven is watching the \Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;The train whistle in the park brings a case to \Na used bookstore that smells nostalgic.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;The store's already packed \Nwith books we can't sell.
0.5;Finding a used book is a once \Nin a lifetime experience.
0.5;Someday these will pass into the \Nhands of the people looking for them.
0.5;Since we helped move the books, \Nwe each get a book for free.
0.5;How generous of you when \Nthe business is struggling.
0.5;You and this store are \Nat the end of their rope.
0.5;We come to Tamaki's Used \NBookstore pretty frequently,
0.5;I'm working the evening shift \Ntoday, so I was out for a walk.
0.5;That's exactly when we were \Nwatching the steam engine.
0.5;That's why we didn't hear \Nthe shelves falling.
0.5;Judging by the situation, \Nthe shelf on the end fell,
0.5;Yes. It's just a minor concussion, \Nso I'll be able to leave soon.
0.5;It's really unfortunate \Nthose bookshelves collapsed.
0.5;but I'm just glad they \Ndidn't injure a customer.
0.5;I wasn't supposed to be \Nin the bookstore then.
0.5;If I'd closed down the \Nshop like Ichiro said...
0.5;The accident was unfortunate, \Nbut it's a good opportunity.
0.5;They'd probably have to \Nstart from the foundation
0.5;Then the books will find their \Nway to people who want them.
0.5;Sorry. There's a lot of preparations \Nto be made and paperwork to fill out.
0.5;I'm working here to earn \Nmoney for the café and train.
0.5;Really? Yujiro-san will \Nmiss having you around.
0.5;If only he'd close the bookstore before \NI'm not around to look after him.
0.5;Is there a reason you want \Nhim to close the bookstore?
0.5;I was worried about letting my dad \Nwork alone in a run down bookstore.
0.5;The accident was unfortunate, but things \Nturned out exactly the way you wanted.
0.5;You're the one who caused \Nthe accident, aren't you?
0.5;This incident could only \Nhave happened deliberately.
0.5;There weren't any books \Nin the shelf on the end.
0.5;You think that bookshelf could've \Npushed over a shelf full of books?
0.5;I don't think it's strange that the \Nslightest bump caused an accident.
0.5;This is the photo that was taken at exactly \Nthree when the steam engine began running.
0.5;So I couldn't have pushed \Nthe shelves over then.
0.5;Maybe not directly, but it's \Npossible using a trick.
0.5;Pay attention to the butterfly \Nat the edge of the frame.
0.5;Don't you think the butterfly's \Nmovements are strange?
0.5;I think the butterfly was \Nstopped on an invisible thread
0.5;Ichiro-san, you connected \Nthe steam engine's wheels
0.5;Once the steam engine's wheels \Nstarted moving at three...
0.5;After most of the thread \Nwas wound up by the wheel,
0.5;the thread broke, throwing \Nthe butterfly in the air.
0.5;The reason you had a leaf stuck \Nto you when you came to see us
0.5;was because you were in the brush \Ntying the string to the shelves.
0.5;Then show us what you're \Nhiding behind your back.
0.5;then what you're holding is evidence \Nthat you planned this accident.
0.5;There's no way a man who was so nice \Nus to us would do something bad.
0.5;Ichiro-san would never \Ntry to kill Yujiro-san!
0.5;He happened to go back to the \Nstore to get his wallet.
0.5;Ichiro-san was only trying \Nto break the shelves,
0.5;but unfortunately Yujiro-san \Ngot caught up in it.
0.5;I didn't want my father to \Npush himself so hard anymore.
0.5;I thought he'd stop working \Nif the shop were gone.
0.5;This is where Tamaki's Used \NBookstore used to be, right?
0.5;We agreed that this was \Nthe best for the three of us.
0.5;Ichiro-san was detained \Nby the police for a while,
0.5;but when Yujiro-san learned how \Nhe felt, he didn't press charges.
0.5;I didn't get the chance \Nto give them to you then.

0.5;who arrived after 2:00 and\Nwatched TV in the next room over!
0.5;This is the latest and\Nstrongest type of fishing line!
0.5;"You're a fisherman;\Ndon't pretend to play dumb!"
0.5;Plus, on our way to this room,\Nwe ran into you at the stairs...
0.5;Please wait in the\NJapanese-style room.
0.5;In short, you were in the\NJapanese-style room after the murder.
0.5;The fact this fishing line was\Nin the garbage is immutable proof!
0.5;Excuse me,\Nbut has Conan-kun been here?
0.5;So this is Kudo...\NKudo Shinichi!
0.5;You suddenly disappear\Nand then reappear!
0.5;Are you suggesting\Nmy theory is faulty?!
0.5;We even tested it\Nout with my own pants!
0.5;and put the needle end through\Nthe pants pocket from the inside.
0.5;Then you pull both ends\Noutside the room, lock the door,
0.5;...the key will enter\Nthe pocket on its own!
0.5;One last tug and the\Nline breaks free of the tape.
0.5;Is the key really in your pocket,\NInspector Megure?
0.5;If you think we're lying,\Nsee for yourself!
0.5;I'm certain I put the line\Nthrough his double pocket!
0.5;It was because Inspector Megure\Nwas sitting when you put the key in.
0.5;the pocket folded\Nand blocked the key's path,
0.5;and the tape came off before\Nit could get into the double pocket.
0.5;Plus the victim was heavyset,\Njust like Inspector Megure.
0.5;when I put my hand\Nin the victim's pocket...
0.5;But it could happen 1 in\N10,000-- no, 1 in 10 times!
0.5;Recall the key's direction when\Nit was in the victim's double pocket.
0.5;Yes. Even if it did get in his\Ndouble pocket 1 in 10,000 times,
0.5;The key couldn't possibly flip over\Nto join the key holder in the pocket.
0.5;means the killer put it in\Nthe double pocket beforehand.
0.5;Then what about this\Nneedle-ended fishing line I found?!
0.5;Another trap set by the killer\Nto place the blame on the old man.
0.5;I found a handful of\Nothers all throughout the house.
0.5;The killer planted\Nthem in other rooms, too.
0.5;So that it wouldn't matter where\Nthe old man was during the murder.
0.5;He simply stepped\Ninto the killer's trap, knowingly.
0.5;and there were books\Nstacked next to the victim.
0.5;The opera was to drown out\Nthe victim's possible screams
0.5;The books were to hide\Nhis possibly-contorted face.
0.5;Whose eyes and ears\Nneeded to be fooled?!
0.5;None of the others who came\Nin with you noticed, either.
0.5;You mean the victim\Nwas still alive then?
0.5;Then she poisoned him with the\Nneedle when pretending to wake him.
0.5;But it was only natural\Nthat no one noticed.
0.5;If the sleeping drug and the\Npoison were both powerful enough...
0.5;...the victim would die immediately\Nafter being pricked, as if asleep.
0.5;She set up the opera\Nand the books just in case.
0.5;But if this sleeping\Ndrug turned up in an autopsy,
0.5;We assumed he was\Ndead before we entered.
0.5;We only would've known he\Nwas knocked out before he was killed.
0.5;In other words, this was a\Npsychological locked room murder,
0.5;based on our assumption that\Nno one would ever invite a detective
0.5;in a way that\Nno one would notice.
0.5;Yeah. Her key holder is of\Nthe same design as the victim's.
0.5;Naturally,\Nhers should also split in two.
0.5;The poison needle was\Nlikely stored in it.
0.5;She customized it so she could pull\Nit out right after entering the room.
0.5;is definitive proof\Nthat she is the killer!
0.5;This is from when\Nshe was still young...
0.5;See? Only her\Nhair is a different color!
0.5;Then you had her\Nwith your husband, Isao-san?
0.5;Yes! She's the daughter of\NYamashiro Kenji, a diplomat outcast
0.5;from society by my current husband\NTsujimura Isao twenty years ago!
0.5;Yes, the man who died\Nin prison twenty years ago.
0.5;and I wound up\Nwife to that devilish man!
0.5;I realized it all when Takayoshi-san\Nbrought home a photo of Yukiko.
0.5;At first, I thought it was just an\Nuncanny resemblance, but Tsujimura...
0.5;Never! I refuse to let him\Nbe with the daughter of that man!
0.5;I wasn't thinking\Nstraight back then...
0.5;You purposely took her bait\Nto try to make up for your past...
0.5;There is no use in\Npretending to be good, Father.
0.5;Because he left this life as\Nan innocent man who was framed.
0.5;Ah. So she was\Nharsh with her daughter
0.5;But how'd you know all\Nthose details about the case?
0.5;You had to have\Nbeen spying from nearby...
0.5;Get real. That kid with the\Nglasses told me on the phone.
0.5;Said there was a weird detective\Nfrom Osaka and to come right away.
0.5;S-S-So I finished up the case\NI was on, hopped on a train--
0.5;He told me it's weird that you\Ndon't ask how I am on the phone!
0.5;You were actually\Nnearby, weren't you?
0.5;I bet you were watching\Nhow worried I was and laughing!
0.5;I can tell plenty\Njust from your voice.
0.5;Shinichi! Hold on!\NI'll go get the doctor!
0.5;There's no winning, losing, above,\Nor below when it comes to logic...
0.5;After all...\Nthere's always only one truth...

0.5;Hey, Kudo!\NAre you sure it's just a cold?!
0.5;Am I turning back into that kid...\Ninto Conan again?!
0.5;You know you shouldn't\Nbe moving around!
0.5;Where were you?! I looked all over!\NAnd where'd you get that shirt?
0.5;He changed clothes\Nand went out the front door.
0.5;And he also said not to tell\Nanyone he was involved with this case...
0.5;After that, I was in\Nbed for three days straight.
0.5;During that time,\NHattori Heiji went back to Osaka,
0.5;and thanks to my request\Nto Ran right before I fainted,

0.5;Now the men in black who\Nshrunk me won't find out I'm alive.
0.5;But how did I turn back\Ninto my high school form?
0.5;Wait a minute! As I recall,\Nhe showed up, and then...
0.5;And then I drank that\Nalcohol he brought!
0.5;If I drink this all,\NI can turn back completely!

0.5;"And referring to himself as ""we"" \Nwhen there's only one of him."
0.5;With the same feelings we've \Nalways held still in our hearts,
0.5;The sudden appearance of an alien \Nleads to a surprising case.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;He was hoping to find witnesses \Nso word would spread.
0.5;He'll probably regret it \Nfor the rest of his life.
0.5;Are you the people who were present \Nwhen the accident occurred yesterday?
0.5;Could seeing this alien \Nreally have scared him?
0.5;We knew what he was because \Nhe called himself an alien.
0.5;...descended the stairs, was surprised \Nwhen he saw the alien below,
0.5;You think he could've heard \Nthat from all the way up here?
0.5;He probably wasn't visiting the \Ntemple since it's abandoned.
0.5;There might be something \Nbehind last night's incident.
0.5;Yeah. Your downstairs neighbors said he \Nwas friendly with his next door neighbor.
0.5;Well, neither of us had anything \Nto do since we're unemployed.
0.5;Six months ago he was laid off \Nfrom the factory he worked at,
0.5;and last night he was \Nsupposed to get paid, but—
0.5;Yeah. He went out last night \Nto get money from them.
0.5;this person X he was blackmailing \Nmust be relieved.
0.5;Where are these characters \Nfrom? He has so many.
0.5;They're karaoke giveaways. \NHe went all the time.
0.5;Maybe he was blackmailing \Nsomeone at the factory.
0.5;He was trying to get rehired at \Nthe factory he was laid off from.
0.5;It could be his former \Nsuperior at the factory.
0.5;Of course not. Hanzaki worked for \None of Sanko's subcontractors.
0.5;I'd like to go determine who X was, but \Nsince it's Sunday, the factory is closed.
0.5;There is something I want \Nto ask about the alien.
0.5;I'm actually not the one \Nwho came up with the idea.
0.5;from a fellow member of the children's\Nliterature club from my college days,
0.5;You should do it as soon as \Npossible. Tomorrow, even.
0.5;Omi-san certainly does have \Nsome interesting ideas.
0.5;We once put on a play for \Nchildren about aliens.
0.5;Omi probably feels bad about \Nlast night's accident, too.
0.5;He recommended that I appear \Naround eight at night.
0.5;Just to confirm, your \Nfriend Omi-san is the one
0.5;who recommended that the alien appear at \N8 PM at the bottom of the Beimyoji steps?
0.5;...and started living at the Sanko \NHeavy Industries employee dorm.
0.5;Would we be able to see Omi-san \Nif we went to the employee dorm?
0.5;It's just a twenty minute walk \Nto Beimyoji from here.
0.5;He'd easily make the alien's \N8 PM appearance.
0.5;Apparently, he works in the \Nproduction management unit.
0.5;He's also responsible for \Ncoordinating with subcontractors,
0.5;so he's in a position to \Ninfluence hiring decisions.
0.5;It wouldn't be strange if he \Nassociated with Hanzaki-san,
0.5;and it's possible Hanzaki-san had \Nsomething on him and was blackmailing.
0.5;Omi-san asked Hanzaki-san to come to \NBeimyoji at 8 so he could give him the money.
0.5;Then he convinced him to start \Nwalking down the stone steps.
0.5;He had him spot the alien \Nplayed by Takedera-san.
0.5;That explains why Hanzaki \Nthought that was an alien.
0.5;In other words, this was a \Npremeditated murder carried out
0.5;by Omi Akira-san to silence\NHanzaki-san, who was blackmailing him.
0.5;There wasn't any guarantee \Nthat he would panic.
0.5;But we could've found the killer sooner \Nif his neighbor would've told us.
0.5;He must've realized what was \Ngoing on with Hanzaki-san.
0.5;There was no way. Not even the \Nnews reported that he screamed.
0.5;The world will believe you're \Nan idiot who came to check out
0.5;the crime scene, and \Naccidentally fell yourself!
0.5;What I said made you realize \Nit was murder, right?
0.5;Then you followed us and figured \Nout who the killer was...
0.5;It won't do you any good \Nif you get yourself killed.
0.5;Omi-san knew the late Hanzaki-san \Nthrough his job at the factory.
0.5;Blackmailed by Hanzaki-san, \NOmi-san decided to silence him.
0.5;As evidence of that, he \Neven tried to kill me!
0.5;since you were throwing around \Nnonsensical accusations.
0.5;I obviously wasn't actually \Ntrying to kill you.
0.5;The women who witnessed it told \Nthe police the same thing.
0.5;But, Takedera-san, normally no one would \Nbelieve that costume is an alien.
0.5;Not unless you heard the person \Nwearing it call himself an alien.
0.5;But Hanzaki-san couldn't \Nhave heard you from up here.
0.5;The women who heard him \Ncall himself an alien.
0.5;And Omi-san, who suggested \Nthe idea in the first place.
0.5;That's why he became \Nfrightened and screamed—
0.5;Both his neighbor and Hanzaki-san \Nthought it was a cold at first.
0.5;But it was acute inflammation of the vocal \Ncords due to overworking his throat.
0.5;It could only have been the man who\Nknew you were playing an alien
0.5;and was here with\NHanzaki-san, Omi Akira-san.
0.5;Last night Omi-san asked \NHanzaki-san to come here.
0.5;After knocking him out, he waited \Nfor Takedera-san's alien to appear.
0.5;Then he pushed him down the \Nstairs and killed Hanzaki-san
0.5;making it look as though he was \Nfrightened by the alien and accidentally fell.
0.5;The police might have suspected foul play \Nand thoroughly investigated the incident.
0.5;you needed witnesses like \NTakedera-san and the two women.
0.5;You know how powerful children's \Nimaginations can be.
0.5;Last night one of the women who \Nwitnessed the incident took a video.
0.5;I had no idea his vocal cords \Nwere giving him trouble.
0.5;I appreciate the money, but I need you \Nto get me a job at the factory, Omi-san.
0.5;Hanzaki saw me shoplift something \Nfrom a convenience store.
0.5;even a crime as petty as shoplifting \Ncould land me in serious trouble.
0.5;who still cares for kids and is satisfied \Nworking at a third-rate company.
0.5;Okay. Omi Akira-san, you're \Na good-for-nothing adult!
0.5;I have some questions about \NKawaguchi Motoko-san.
0.5;Terakado-san had some concerns \Nregarding Kawaguchi.

0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;The president said he \Nwanted to speak with you.
0.5;It must be about the plan \Nwe discussed the other day.
0.5;I'm sorry, but you'll \Nhave to ask him yourself.
0.5;Unfortunately, it's designed \Nfor professionals.
0.5;It's for requests for event \Ncharacters and modeling.
0.5;But what if another company \Ncopies your figures?
0.5;Yeah. You should watch \Nout for corporate spies.
0.5;Don't worry. We check everyone's identity \Nand possessions before taking them on tours.
0.5;Besides, it's not that easy \Nto get inside the studio.
0.5;It's a goblin, like the ones \Nthat appear in Western stories.
0.5;Heroes like Perseus and Orpheus who \Nbecame constellations rode on this ship.
0.5;It's a legendary flying ship that \Nappears in Japanese mythology.
0.5;Despite its appearance, it's made \Nof fiberglass, so it's light.
0.5;If the remote detects any \Nshocks or malfunctions,
0.5;control switches to the \Ncontrol room inside the dome.
0.5;the power inside the dome goes \Nout for a second, but it's safe.
0.5;As long as there's nothing wrong with \Nthe remote, control switches back to it.
0.5;They've even got Indian \Nmythological creatures.
0.5;That's right. We only move Talos and the \Nfloating boat for special occasions.
0.5;Talos in particular took an \Nincredible amount of effort.
0.5;His fists and arms alone \Nwere redone countless times.
0.5;Honestly, it's quite difficult to build \Nthe entire body of something that large.
0.5;Didn't we decide that we'd \Nleave it up to the president?
0.5;but as the one holding the company's \Npurse strings, I'll never agree to it.
0.5;The only weakness of the \Nbronze automaton Talos,
0.5;The Talos you saw is too \Nbig to leave the dome,
0.5;By breaking him down into \Nparts and transporting them,
0.5;the bronze giant Talos can appear \Nbefore audiences around the world.
0.5;You're free to look at and \Ntouch everything in here.
0.5;I hope we get to see the \Ncompleted Talos soon.

0.5;Under current circumstances, \Nour company has no future.
0.5;It's not that easy a matter \Nto compromise, Shinobu-san.
0.5;Fine. Let's go get the \Npresident's decision now.
0.5;She asked me to design Talos' driving \Nsystem as cheaply as possible.
0.5;Because of your cowardice, Yamagata-san \Nwill never be able to show off his talents.
0.5;You're not an employee. \NYou've no right to talk.
0.5;If he doesn't stop showing off his \Ntalents, the company won't last.
0.5;Doesn't this studio exist because \Nof Yamagata-san's talent?
0.5;My company's been in the red \Nsince his father worked here.
0.5;Professor Agasa's meeting \Nsure is taking a long time.
0.5;The rumors about the company \Nbeing sold are true.
0.5;The president is acting \Nwithout telling Yamagata-san.
0.5;I've been talking to other companies, \Nbut it's not going well.
0.5;Our top priority is keeping the Kagami \Nname, but that's become difficult.
0.5;They said they'd consider it if \Nwe had a special plan in place.
0.5;That can't be good. Doesn't \Nshe have Kyogoku-san?
0.5;She was just excited to \Ntalk to a handsome man.
0.5;The buyer you're talking about is \Nthe Suzuki Conglomerate, isn't it?
0.5;A classmate said she saw you \Nat a Suzuki family party.
0.5;She said you were dancing with \Ntheir daughter all night.
0.5;Suzuki Sonoko-san took \Na strange liking to me.
0.5;In any case, I need a plan to \Npresent them to seal the deal.
0.5;Sir, my kids are young. What \Nif the company goes under?
0.5;This place does pay better \Nthan other companies.
0.5;Why is a company as clean \Nas ours going under?
0.5;Who knows? Maybe that's \Njust how the world works.
0.5;This isn't good. Let's make \Nsure it gets fixed immediately.
0.5;The company's technology and designs \Nhave an established reputation here.
0.5;It's ironic. Their exceptional technology \Nhas become a burden for them.
0.5;We had a shouting match like the old \Ndays, but that was the end of it.
0.5;I'm going to ask the president \Nhow negotiations are going.
0.5;Tell him Kagami has finally \Nmade his decision.
0.5;Let's drop all pretenses and \Nhave one last conversation.
0.5;Sorry, but wait there. I \Ncan't come to the door.
0.5;Your father is a compassionate \Nman, but he's stubborn.
0.5;Well? This is the most I'm \Nwilling to compromise.
0.5;I hope you'll consider signing \Na contract under these terms.
0.5;They're making a killing \Nin transmedia business.
0.5;Because he expects negotiations \Nto move slowly,

0.5;We decided to hang out at the pool,\Nbut the daughter of the hotel's owner,

0.5;After lunch, we returned to the pool and \Ndiscovered Nagami-ojosama was missing.
0.5;Th-There's something in\Nthe middle of the pool!
0.5;She said the hotel manager was \Nletting them use the hotel to meet.
0.5;We were planning to celebrate in the \Nsuite since she loves this hotel.
0.5;Since it was a surprise, we \Ndidn't tell Nagami-ojosama.
0.5;Because we were meeting in that room, she \Ngot the wrong idea and said those things.
0.5;She really did like that room, so \NI'm not surprised she was angry.
0.5;Yes. She's even kicked out guests with \Na reservation to stay in that room.
0.5;We discussed the party\Ndecorations with them.
0.5;First I'd like to hear what you were \Ndoing after you left Nagami-san alone.

0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;The Mystery Sinking in the \NMidsummer Pool, Part Two!
0.5;Only the staff entered the pool\Nafter we were ordered to close it.
0.5;The manager, Hamaka-ojosama, secretary \NSamaki-san, and those two bellboys.
0.5;Before Nagami-ojosama was left \Nalone, we let those girls through.
0.5;I was going to tell her to\Nlet someone else do it.
0.5;But Hamaka-ojosama, who arrived \Nwhen he left, left at 12:54.
0.5;I had a 1 PM reservation \Nfor lunch at this hotel.
0.5;Samaki-san asked me to check \Nthe bathroom and changing room.
0.5;She wasn't at the pool, \Neither, so I panicked.
0.5;I couldn't trust my phone's clock, \Nso I asked to check the time.
0.5;The changing room and showers are \Nbetween reception and the pool.
0.5;Yes. The two receptionists \Ncan't see back here, either.
0.5;We called the bellboys, too, and \Nthey split up to look for her.
0.5;We even searched the men's \Nrooms while calling for her.
0.5;We couldn't find her after \Nan hour of searching,
0.5;so we asked the receptionists if \Nthey really didn't see her leave.
0.5;While we were explaining the situation, \Nthe bellboys saw her body in the pool.
0.5;She wasn't there when you \Nlooked together, right?
0.5;There's a hook stuck in the \Nwall directly above the drain.
0.5;the victim Oiso Nagami-san said she'd search \Nfor the necklace she lost at the pool alone.
0.5;the manager Toyoshima-san \Ncame to check on Nagami-san.
0.5;She said he was in the \Nway and made him leave.
0.5;Next, when the secretary Samaki-san came, \Nhe didn't see Nagami-san in the pool.
0.5;and he told her to check the \Nchanging room and bathroom.
0.5;Later, the three of you and the two bellboys \Nsplit up to search but couldn't find her.
0.5;the two bellboys returned to the pool \Nand found Nagami-san in the water.
0.5;Are those the correct times \Nand sequence of events?
0.5;During that time, only you three \Nentered and left the pool area.
0.5;But if the body was in \Nthe pool the whole time,
0.5;then someone would have found \Nit while you split up to search.
0.5;Furthermore, it's hard to \Nimagine someone put the body
0.5;in the middle of the pool unnoticed \Nwhile you were searching.
0.5;Detective Takagi headed to the pool \Nafter talking to Conan-kun and Sera-san.
0.5;While you were in the bathroom, he \Nwas carrying around a big aquarium.
0.5;Also, he said we should all \Ncome see the experiment.
0.5;We finished investigating, so we thought \Nwe'd try Takagi-san's experiment.
0.5;But if you cut the fishing \Nline attached to this hook...
0.5;When light passes from the highly refractive \Nwater to the less refractive air,
0.5;if you look at the boundary between \Nthe water and air head on,
0.5;all the light is reflected like a mirror, \Nand you can't see objects on the other side.
0.5;You can see my ten yen coin \Ninside the aquarium, right?
0.5;But if you turn a cup upside down and put \Nit over the coin while there's air inside...
0.5;You probably learned \Nabout it in grade school.
0.5;They teach this complicated stuff \Nto first year grade school students?
0.5;Because he was inside an upside \Ndown aquarium filled with air,
0.5;If you view the boundary between \Nthe air and water at a low angle,
0.5;After drowning Nagami-san, who was \Nsearching for her necklace alone,
0.5;the culprit placed an aquarium \Nover her body and secured it
0.5;using a fishing line passed through \Nthe drains on both sides of the pool.
0.5;Then they tilted the aquarium, \Nslipped their hand in,
0.5;and released the air from Nagami-san's \Ntank to fill the aquarium.
0.5;Fishing line is elastic, so it could \Nhandle the aquarium being tilted.
0.5;They said something to her so \Nshe would let her guard down,
0.5;grabbed her neck from behind, removed \Nher mouthpiece, and held her under.
0.5;With the tank and weights, \NNagami-san sank easily.
0.5;Did you lower her guard \Nby pointing at the pool
0.5;But can you really secure an aquarium \Nwith a single fishing line?
0.5;If you make four grooves and set the \Nline in them, it won't float easily.
0.5;And if you attach the end of the line to a \Nhook attached near the surface of the pool,
0.5;even if you're not in the water, you can cut the \Nline, make the aquarium float, and reveal the body.
0.5;When everyone finished searching, he \Ncut the line, and revealed the body.
0.5;But the aquarium made a pretty \Nbig noise when it floated up.
0.5;Everyone else looking for \Nher was shouting, too.
0.5;Not in the middle of the pool \Nnear her body, but by the edge.
0.5;It had to have been when they pulled \NNagami-san's body out of the pool.
0.5;But the only thing the manager \Nwas carrying was the tank.
0.5;Maybe he stuck his foot in the aquarium \Nand dragged it along the bottom.
0.5;After bringing it to the edge, he struck \Nit with the tank and shattered it.
0.5;and it would have been barely \Naudible in the water.
0.5;But the manager hurt himself \Non the broken glass.
0.5;No one would think the man who \Nhurt himself would do that.
0.5;But if the police were going\Nto find the aquarium anyway,
0.5;When he cut it, he had to quickly reel in the\Nline attached to the drain on the other side.
0.5;Manager Toyoshima's fingerprints \Nshould be all over it.
0.5;But he probably gathered it \Ntogether while reeling them in,
0.5;so his fingerprints should \Nmatch up to a few places.
0.5;We discussed celebrating \Nher birthday together.
0.5;I didn't want to celebrate, \Nespecially not in that suite.
0.5;She reserved the room with her husband \Nbecause they wanted just once to stay there.
0.5;They were celebrating their \Nson's third birthday.
0.5;and that day's fireworks display would \Nhave been visible from the balcony.
0.5;Nagami-ojosama said she wanted to view the \Nfireworks from that room with her friends.
0.5;My sister's family had to\Nmove to another hotel.
0.5;On the way there, they got in \Nan accident, and they all died.
0.5;Yes. That woman was riding in the \Ncar that killed my sister's family.
0.5;She was riding in her friend's \Ncar when it caused an accident,
0.5;She asked me to pretend she had been \Nin the suite since that afternoon.
0.5;Since then, I'd been waiting \Nfor my opportunity for revenge.
0.5;Removing the necklace that would \Nset my plan in motion was a gamble.

0.5;So the kid with glasses \Nwas Conan-kun after all.
0.5;No. The entrance had been \Nclosed over the holidays.
0.5;The only way to the roof was \Nto take the emergency stairs.
0.5;Someone must have carried the plastered \NFukurokoji-san to the roof and thrown him off.
0.5;It wasn't an attempted suicide, \Nit was an attempted murder.
0.5;We think the culprit blended \Nin with the crowd and left.
0.5;Those. See where the dirt has \Nbeen wiped off the railing?
0.5;Fukurokoji-san's clothes must have \Nrubbed against it when he fell.
0.5;But why did the culprit bother \Nto carry him to the roof?
0.5;They were trying to make it \Nlook like a suicide, right?
0.5;Which means the culprit initially \Ntried to drop him from here,
0.5;but he resisted and ended \Nup dropping him over there.
0.5;Fukurokoji-san was drunk and doesn't \Nremember anything that happened last night.
0.5;Also, he said that since he's a \Nloser in our competitive society,
0.5;But the fact of the matter \Nis that he was nearly killed.
0.5;We'll try to figure out where \NFukurokoji-san went last night.
0.5;The culprit made contact\Nwith him somewhere!
0.5;You told your friend \Nabout your bad luck, too?
0.5;This is Yukigaya Daisuke. \NI'm proud to call him my friend.
0.5;He agreed to stop by since \Nwe were in the area.
0.5;He's great at his job, athletic, and \Nfrom a rich and distinguished family.
0.5;We started working at the same \Ntime, but we're nothing alike.
0.5;After all, he's never \Nexperienced any kind of setback.
0.5;How do you feel about people who \Nhaven't experienced setbacks?
0.5;If you can make it through \Nlife that way, why not?
0.5;I didn't happen to come here, \NI was waiting for someone.
0.5;I got a love letter from \Na woman I don't know.
0.5;Maybe it was because of all the \Nfuss, but she never showed up.
0.5;When I came here so I could see \Nthe clock, he fell off the roof.
0.5;This place is directly under \Nthe other scratch marks.
0.5;Detective Takagi said \NFukurokoji-san resisted,
0.5;so the spot the culprit \Ninitially tried to push him
0.5;was different from where \Nhe was actually pushed.
0.5;The culprit was trying to \Nkill not only Fukurokoji-san,
0.5;but also trying to kill Komatsu-san by \Nmaking it look like he was mixed up in a suicide.
0.5;They were trying to get \Nrid of two people at once.
0.5;...with the love letter, and had to \Ncarry Fukurokoji-san to the roof.
0.5;In other words, the culprit is someone who \Nresents both Fukurokoji-san and Komatsu-san.
0.5;We've never received one \Nbefore, so we're jealous.
0.5;"""I've always been drawn to the way you \Ndon't let your bad luck get you down."""
0.5;"""Thirteen days from now, I'll be waiting in \Nfront of Beika Building One at eight o'clock."""
0.5;There's no name. Who would take this \Nseriously and go out to meet them?
0.5;You're wrong. It's one-sided, \Nbut there's a girl I like.
0.5;I went so I could tell her \NI couldn't go out with her.
0.5;"""P.S. Please bring this letter \Nwith you to our meeting."""
0.5;If their plan had succeeded, there \Nwould have been a huge fuss.
0.5;Now that you mentioned it, \Nhe hasn't been coming lately.
0.5;About two weeks ago, he \Nasked me out on a date.
0.5;But since I turned him down, he \Nstopped coming the very next day.
0.5;Because I can't stand confident people \Nlike him who think they have everything.
0.5;People who truly believe \Nthat are so wonderful.
0.5;Oh, no! I'll bring your desserts \Nand drinks right away!
0.5;It's not one-sided. Sakiko-san \Nlikes Komatsu-san, too.
0.5;It looks like everyone \Naround them knows it, too.
0.5;They said he stopped by Komatsu-san's \Nplace since he was in the area, right?
0.5;It would make sense if he \Nhadn't been here in a while.
0.5;But he comes around here every \Nday since his office is here.
0.5;But if you consider he visited Komatsu-san to\Nsee if he realized he committed the crime...
0.5;And if he did it, then I think I know \Nwhy he had Komatsu-san bring the letter.
0.5;But the culprit tried to kill \NKomatsu-san and Fukurokoji-san.
0.5;If he comes up in the police\Ninvestigation as well, then it'll be 100%.
0.5;Last night, Fukurokoji-san \Nwas drinking alone at a bar.
0.5;Apparently the man's clothes were \Nworn out and his hair was disheveled.
0.5;But in the end, we don't think \Nhe's connected to the incident.
0.5;Now that you mention it, I \Ndid hit it off with someone.
0.5;That's right. I'd understand if there \Nwas trouble between them, but...
0.5;They're physically similar, \Nbut there's no motive.
0.5;That's it! The culprit wasn't trying \Nto kill two birds with one stone.
0.5;You're thinking something \Nunbelievable, aren't you?
0.5;Yukigaya-san, you've never \Nexperienced disappointment, right?
0.5;it must have been really shocking when \NSakiko-san turned you down for a date.
0.5;He's the one who wrote the love letter \Nand dropped Fukurokoji-san from here.
0.5;Last night, he led the plastered \NFukurokoji-san out of the bar,
0.5;carried him to the roof, and tried \Nto drop him on top of Komatsu-san.
0.5;Ultimately, though, he failed \Nto kill him as planned.
0.5;If his plan had succeeded, Fukurokoji-san and\NKomatsu-san would have been beyond saving.
0.5;If Sakiko-san saw the letter, \Nshe would have been shocked.
0.5;It would mean he suffered an unfortunate \Ndeath because he was lured out by a woman.
0.5;Then you would've laughed scornfully at \NSakiko-san for getting what she deserved.
0.5;That's why you had to have \Nhim bring the letter.
0.5;It was the most critical tool \Nfor making Sakiko-san sad.
0.5;Uh, why would Sakiko-chan be sad if I \Ndied holding a love letter from a woman?
0.5;Not a confident man who'd never \Nexperienced disappointment.
0.5;If you'd dropped a block, the police would \Nhave know it was a premeditated murder.
0.5;Not even the police would imagine someone \Nusing a living human as a weapon.
0.5;Fukurokoji-san was dropped only \Nto take Komatsu-san's life.
0.5;You searched for someone you could \Nuse and found Fukurokoji-san.
0.5;There's no point in keeping \Ntrash like him alive.
0.5;In fact, just him existing \Nin this world is unsightly.
0.5;Didn't you tell us to \Ncome at four, Conan-kun?
0.5;He acknowledged that he attempted \Nto murder the two men.
0.5;And because this culprit is \Na very exceptional person,
0.5;We collected this initially, but \Nwe had no one to compare it to.
0.5;It was stuck to Fukurokoji-san's \Njacket button.
0.5;I can't believe I left a \Ntrace on that trash's jacket.
0.5;Even if it is my hair, \NI have plenty of excuses.
0.5;After all, it wouldn't be like me \Nto end the story without beauty.

0.5;Just as Mori said,\Nhe had been on the Ryujin-Maru.
0.5;Yes. Hamada threw him and the\Nowner into the stormy ocean
0.5;Hamada. His real name\Nwas apparently Aoki.
0.5;But the storm tore rocks off\Nand sealed the exit.
0.5;He probably didn't plan to,\Nbut there were no other hiding places.
0.5;The islanders stayed away\Nbecause of the 'curse.'
0.5;Even more so after he killed\Nthe professor to make it look like
0.5;You pretended to get shot by\NUehara-san to let him escape, huh?
0.5;If he were arrested, Hamada-san's\Nkiller and the gold's location
0.5;That's right. He did seem\Nvaguely aware of this place.
0.5;"Never mind that; you're a\Ndead man if they catch you now!"
0.5;Your situation will get even\Nworse if you're caught with it.
0.5;Then you beat him to\Nthe cave and killed him.
0.5;That's right.\NNow our discussion is over!
0.5;It's probably buried\Naround here somewhere.
0.5;I'll leisurely look for it\Nafter things cool down.
0.5;You'd never find it in 100\Nyears with your intelligence!
0.5;The gold was in these blocks\Nused as part of the stairs.
0.5;Take this board to the exit!\NI'll bring Kinoshita-san!
0.5;There's probably no way\Nto dig out the gold
0.5;I doubt anyone would\Nspend over a billion yen
0.5;In the end, the greed-inducing\Ngold returned to the earth,
0.5;You idiot! If I hadn't gone to\Nrescue you in the fishing boat,
0.5;there's no telling\Nwhat would've happened!
0.5;What are you doing to my\NConan-kun?!
0.5;I don't get it! Where did\Nthe killer disappear to?!
0.5;Next episode Genta the \Nkaiju makes his appearance.

0.5;But Kyogoku-san might chide \Nyou if he saw you in that.
0.5;"""Sonoko-san, a woman must \Nkeep her hips warm."""
0.5;I used to wear swimsuits like \Nthis one when I was little.
0.5;I was kind of drawn to \Nthe micro bikinis, but...
0.5;If someone with your body \Nwore one of those...
0.5;Nitsuka, the woman who collapsed \Nin the changing room last week,
0.5;You were feeling anemic \Nand lost consciousness.
0.5;I had an allergic reaction \Nand lost consciousness.
0.5;That high-handed, unpleasant \Nlooking woman with gaudy nails.
0.5;Could that high-handed, \Nunpleasant looking woman
0.5;with gaudy nails you're \Ncomplaining about be me?
0.5;why don't you hold your breath \Nwhile you use the changing room?
0.5;an allergy to dogs can be triggered \Nnot just be inhaling dog hair,
0.5;but also coming in contact \Nwith fur, dander, or saliva.
0.5;Have you forgotten that I \Nagreed to take on your debts,
0.5;Oh, yes. I was just assigned \Nto this shop last month.
0.5;I know the owner. I'll be \Nsure to tell him about you.
0.5;That there's an eyesore at his shop \Nwho dared to tell me what to do,
0.5;I don't know what's going on, \Nbut I'm staying out of that.
0.5;She seems like the first person \Nto become a victim in a mystery.
0.5;Don't. I'm in a good mood \Nafter buying a cute swimsuit.
0.5;That store the kid was \Ntalking about is nearby.
0.5;Yes. There's a dead customer \Nin the changing room.
0.5;Come to think of it, it looked like she \Nwiped her lipstick off with her finger.
0.5;She put lipstick on her thumb and \Ngrasped it before she was killed.
0.5;Yeah, the high-handed and \Nunpleasant looking woman.
0.5;for saying she'd be killed \Nfirst in a mystery novel.
0.5;Actually, I think it's the \Nkid who caused her death.
0.5;Sashihara-sama hadn't come out \Nof the changing room for a while.
0.5;so when I opened the curtain to look \Ninside, I-I found her like this.
0.5;Was anyone using the changing \Nrooms next to hers at the time?
0.5;I often accompanied the president \Nwhen she went shopping.
0.5;the right changing room \Nbefore I went in there.
0.5;No, I just saw the white sandals they \Nleft in front of the changing room.
0.5;How many customers were inside \Nthe store at the time?
0.5;That boy told me not to \Nlet anyone leave, though.
0.5;Conan-kun had been telling us \Nall about how the murdered woman
0.5;and these three were \Narguing before the murder.
0.5;But it's not good that \Nthe other customers left.
0.5;But I don't think we have \Nany near the changing rooms.
0.5;Her left hand has the pointer \Nfinger and thumb extended.
0.5;Her right hand was holding her thumb \Nwhich was stained with lipstick.
0.5;Maybe, but the killer \Ncould've left it on purpose.
0.5;The victim clenched her \Nhands as hard as she could
0.5;Which way was her left hand pointing \Nwhen the body was discovered?
0.5;In other words, the woman using \Nthe left changing room...
0.5;If the person I killed had \Ntheir hand inside their jacket,
0.5;I'd be worried she was holding \Nsome kind of evidence.
0.5;changed the orientation of \Nher body after killing her.
0.5;She said she was going to \Na party overseas next week.
0.5;Europeans generally count \None with their thumb,
0.5;two with their pointer finger, and \Nthree with their middle finger.
0.5;Conan-kun, is that really \Nwhat they do in Europe?
0.5;I saw on TV that they do \Nthis in Germany and France.
0.5;C-Come to think of it, that hand shape \Nlooks like something, doesn't it?
0.5;And the guns used by the \NJapanese police are...
0.5;It's strange that no one heard \Nthe victim scream, though.
0.5;if someone entered your room \Nwhile you were changing.
0.5;In any case, we'd like \Nto question each of you
0.5;All three of them are \Nalmost exactly the same.
0.5;The question is how did the killer \Nget inside the changing room.
0.5;The killer's reflection should've \Nappeared in this mirror.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The Blind \NSpot in the Changing Room, Part Two!"""
0.5;It suddenly started raining when \Nwe went to see the lighthouse.
0.5;Strange things have been happening \Nat this mansion lately.
0.5;but the master isn't the \Ntype to make up stories.
0.5;According to him, it's \Na yellowish white color.
0.5;H-Hey, did you guys just\Nsee something yellow?
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Given your studies, how \Ndo you feel about ghosts?
0.5;I don't believe in them, but my uncle \Nseems to think they actually exist.
0.5;My uncle bought it five \Nyears ago when he retired,
0.5;Did he buy it without knowing \Nabout the ghost rumors?
0.5;My uncle started saying there \Nwere ghosts about two weeks ago.
0.5;Yeah. My aunt actually \Npassed away two months ago.
0.5;I'm going to submit something \Nto this fall's exhibition.
0.5;It must've been quite the \Nshock for your uncle.
0.5;Is it? If you like it, \Nyou're welcome to more.
0.5;If he's being deceived by someone, \Nthe Detective Boys can't ignore it.
0.5;Yeah, but Otaguro-san seems happy, \Nand we don't know that he's—
0.5;You know there's no end \Nto cases where someone
0.5;takes advantage of an \Nelderly person's feelings!
0.5;They're just children, but I can't \Nbelieve you're going on about ghosts.
0.5;I can lend you some umbrellas \Nif you're leaving.
0.5;Even if the ghost's real, \Nit's just his wife, right?
0.5;Besides, we always have \Ntea around this hour here.
0.5;Because I swapped the contents \Nof the poison bottle
0.5;I found the bottle Hana-san took from \Nthe cabinet and hid in the kitchen.
0.5;Hana-san was worried the \Nghost would reveal the truth
0.5;behind the accident that \Nhappened two months ago.
0.5;I won't ask you to return the necklaces \Nand brooches you've stolen.
0.5;I thought she'd have trouble getting in and \Nout of her wheelchair if I loosened the brakes.
0.5;But there was nothing she \Ncould do about a ghost.
0.5;Yeah. The ghost is the \Nlight from the lighthouse.
0.5;The light seeping through the \Nwalls reflected off the glass
0.5;on Otaguro-san's bookcase \Nand looked like a ghost.
0.5;He said he closes the \Nwindows every night at ten.
0.5;By the way, he also leaves \Nthe windows open
0.5;when it rains so it doesn't \Nget stuffy inside.
0.5;What about the glow on the \Nsecond floor when we arrived?
0.5;But there was a woman's \Nvoice coming from the room.
0.5;for salt in another bottle and \Nreturned it to the cabinet.
0.5;she would've locked it so \Nshe wouldn't be discovered.
0.5;But it's strange for an \Nexpert like Hideto-san
0.5;to leave a cabinet containing \Npoison unlocked.
0.5;since the ghost is the \Nlight from the lighthouse,
0.5;Thinking that, I just \Nexamined Otaguro-san's room.
0.5;A speaker, mic, and wireless \Ndevice behind the bookcase.
0.5;This is probably where your \Nwife's voice was coming from.
0.5;The only person in this house \Nwho could've made this
0.5;playing his own voice \Nmodified to sound feminine.
0.5;Since Otaguro-san believed his \Nwife's ghost was visiting him,
0.5;When Hideto-san arrived at \Nthe scene of the accident,
0.5;He also noticed how Hana-san began acting \Nsince the ghost started appearing.
0.5;Hideto-san realized Hana-san \Nwas connected to the accident.
0.5;so she'd think the truth behind \Nthe accident would be revealed.
0.5;And he deliberately broke a beaker \Nin front of the unlocked cabinet
0.5;and asked her to clean it \Nknowing what Hana-san would do.
0.5;Hana-san took the poison and \Nattempted to murder Otaguro-san.
0.5;Hideto-san, you've been borrowing \Nmoney from a bunch of places.
0.5;Could you leave those windows \Nopen a little longer tonight?
0.5;You're like a child enthralled \Nby the god of death.

0.5;It sounded like something \Nrather large collapsing.
0.5;You're saying this second exhibition \Nhall was closed the whole time?
0.5;The exhibition isn't for a while. All \Nthe exhibits were under construction.
0.5;We were in the middle of temporarily \Nassembling this brachiosaurus.
0.5;It's possible he came to \Ncheck on the exhibits.
0.5;I can't believe he got \Ncaught in this accident.
0.5;We determined the wires supporting \Nthe fossil were cut by someone.
0.5;But it would take a lot of \Ntime to cut all these wires.
0.5;The tool we believe was used to cut the \Nwires was right next to the collapsed fossil.
0.5;nobody entered or exited \Nthe building or grounds
0.5;What were each of you doing \Nwhen the fossil collapsed?
0.5;Katsuragawa Yua-san, you were alone \Nin the office the whole time?
0.5;Besides, I'm not the only \None who wanted to kill him!
0.5;We need flashier events that \Nwill attract more guests.
0.5;We're going to put on a show \Nthat will draw tons of kids.
0.5;But, sir, these plesiosaur fossils \Nare academically significant—
0.5;walking the earth millions \Nof years ago excites me.
0.5;But like you, I wanted \Neveryone to enjoy them.
0.5;I want people to see the real \Nthing. I take pride in my work.
0.5;The office Katsuragawa-san was in \Nwas in the back of the staff room.
0.5;We learned it would've been impossible for \Nher to leave around the time of the incident
0.5;Which means the only suspicious \Nperson is you, Kuchiki-san.
0.5;Kuchiki-san, we found \Nseveral pieces of evidence.
0.5;"Come to the brachiosaurus in \Nexhibition hall 2. Kuchiki."""
0.5;I've never seen that.\NI didn't send that letter.
0.5;Kuchiki-san, you cut several \Nof the wires beforehand.
0.5;You went to get the director \Nwhen the show started.
0.5;Then you went to the exhibition \Nhall and cut the last wire.
0.5;Yes. According to forensics, \Nit's a type of resin.
0.5;It's used to preserve fossils \Nbecause it's highly transparent.
0.5;This was spilled on the \Nfloor of the crime scene.
0.5;According to forensics, it \Nwas spilled rather recently.
0.5;Kuchiki-san, you use this \Nliquid regularly, don't you?
0.5;He's probably thinking \Nabout that dinosaur show.
0.5;Inspector Megure, are you sure \NKuchiki-san is the culprit?
0.5;He has no alibi, and he left \Nsomething at the crime scene.
0.5;Kuchiki-san has spent his \Nlife researching dinosaurs,
0.5;Naito-san was first seen \Nat the start of the show.
0.5;What if he had exited the \Nstage immediately afterwards
0.5;You could've gone to the director's \Noffice while speaking.
0.5;We found one piece in the hallway \Nin front of the director's office.
0.5;You disappeared into the smoke \Nand exited the stage once again.
0.5;This time you went outside and headed to \Nthe rear entrance of exhibition hall 2,
0.5;You used the sound effects of the dinosaur \Nshow to mask the sound of the falling fossil.
0.5;After spilling the coating \Nagent on the floor,
0.5;There were pieces of fossil near the \Nrear entrance of the exhibition hall.
0.5;They must've stuck to the bottom of your shoe \Nwhen you stepped on them before falling there.
0.5;You're the one who used my \Ndinosaurs to kill the director?
0.5;See? It's just his imagination \Nthat I killed him.
0.5;There was a sound system \Nremote in the pocket.
0.5;You used this to play the sound of \Nit falling after the show ended...
0.5;It sounded like something \Nrather large collapsing

0.5;Have them examine the director's office \Nand the rear entrance to the exhibition hall.
0.5;We're going to examine the \Nbottoms of your shoes.
0.5;You suddenly defended the clerk and \Nexplained Kuchiki-san's actions.
0.5;When you helped Ayumi-chan \Nup during the show,
0.5;I used the money I had to \Nhelp him acquire this museum.
0.5;But once he became director, \Nhe said he wouldn't pay me back.
0.5;Not even the most savage dinosaur \Nwould pursue its prey so recklessly.
0.5;I'm not buying you anything \Nno matter what you say.

0.5;Were you invited to Anna's \Nbirthday party as well?

0.5;I was suddenly struck on the head \Nwhile loading luggage into the cabin.
0.5;I woke up when I heard the gunshots \Nand found myself inside the locker.
0.5;That's right. He's the only \None who could have done this.
0.5;but when I looked into it, I \Ndiscovered that he was a conman.
0.5;He offered Anna-san a fake investment offer \Nand stole close to 50 million from Happywow.
0.5;He also owed Anna-san herself \Na huge amount of money.
0.5;Only the president herself \Nknew exactly how much he took,
0.5;but we repeatedly urged her to \Nfile a proper reimbursement claim.
0.5;There was a bottle decorated with \Na ribbon and a box on the deck.
0.5;VP Inamura and Director Enami \Nbrought those themselves.
0.5;The VP got her champagne, and \Nthe director got her a watch.
0.5;They're busy people, so I went \Nto buy their gifts for them.
0.5;Both the champagne and the watch \Nare incredibly high quality.
0.5;Are you also the one who brought \Nthe dog food into the cabin?
0.5;Yeah. I thought the president \Nwould bring her dog.
0.5;Right. Anna-san is always \Nwith her poodle Sally-chan.
0.5;Yes. Three days ago while I was preparing \Nto go out, along with my entire car.
0.5;You're the one who taught Anna about \Nbusiness when she was an unsuccessful idol.
0.5;You were angry and in disbelief \Nthat Anna was the president.
0.5;Maybe you killed her because she \Nwas demanding you repay her.
0.5;You're the one who benefits most from \NAnna's death as the vice president.
0.5;But once the company was on track, \Nyou didn't need her anymore.
0.5;Anna-san wasn't shot by \NInamura-san or Enami-san!
0.5;See? You're assuming I did it when \Nyou don't even have any evidence.
0.5;Between seven and eight, the culprit \Nhid in the cabin of the cruiser
0.5;Surely you can prove where \Nyou were during that time.
0.5;No. During that time, I was \Nrobbing Anna's apartment.
0.5;And I knew she was throwing her \Nbirthday party here at eight.
0.5;There was only 30 thousand in cash, \Nbut just as I was leaving with it
0.5;I accidentally dropped \Nmy gym membership card.
0.5;It's about ten kilometers west \Ndown the coast from here.
0.5;so they can check on their pet \Nwhile they're out of the house.
0.5;So today's video should \Nbe on Anna-san's phone.
0.5;There should be video of him \Nrobbing the house on here.
0.5;You knew she had a pet camera and \Ndropped your card on purpose.
0.5;If I have an accomplice, why \Ndon't you bring them here?
0.5;But even if he didn't have an accomplice, \Nhe still could've killed Anna-san.
0.5;Morishima-san, weren't you unconscious \Ninside that locker the whole time?
0.5;If he left the boat while \NMorishima-san was unconscious
0.5;If he broke into her apartment \Npretending to rob her,
0.5;deliberately dropped his card \Nso the camera would see it,
0.5;It's only possible if Morishima-san \Nwas actually unconscious.
0.5;I actually regained consciousness as \Nsoon as I was stuffed into the locker.
0.5;I was watching the masked man's \Nback from inside the locker.
0.5;So the culprit was on \Nthe ship the whole time?
0.5;If I'd raised the alarm then, it's possible \Nthe president wouldn't have been shot.
0.5;I'm surprised you knew Morishima-san \Nhad regained consciousness.
0.5;Maybe the culprit knew that Morishima-san \Nwould wake up immediately
0.5;In other words, they planned to use \NMorishima-san as their alibi from the start.

0.5;Which is what I'd like to say, but this\Nis the underground parking garage!
0.5;Were you even being\Nserious about going?!
0.5;Inspector Megure.\NI brought Detective Mori.
0.5;The cause of death was\Nsuffocation by strangulation.
0.5;There's no question\Nthis was a murder.
0.5;All three of your testimonies\Nare needed this time.
0.5;Yes, it's true that my wife\Nand I didn't get along.
0.5;That's why I hired Mori-san\Nto check up on her...
0.5;Inspector. What was\Nthe estimated time of death?
0.5;We won't know the\Ndetails until the autopsy,
0.5;but judging from the state of rigor mortis,\NI'd say between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m.
0.5;Yeah, that's when\Nwe were at the hotel.
0.5;So they called us here\Nto confirm his alibi...
0.5;I parted with Mori-san\Nand left the hotel.
0.5;I finished researching my next case,\Nand then when I came home, my wife was--
0.5;Mori-kun. You're certain\Nyou were with Mr. Tatsumi
0.5;He only disappeared\Nfrom my sight once,
0.5;"Yeah! They said,\N""I'm Mrs. Tatsumi, of course!"""
0.5;Which means she was\Nstill alive at that time?
0.5;The tape of that conversation should\Nstill be in the phone at the hotel!
0.5;At any rate,\NTatsumi-sensei was with me
0.5;"between 2:00 and 3:00;\Nhis alibi is airtight."
0.5;And besides, the hotel\Nis 10 kilometers from his home.
0.5;"The focus of the investigation\Nis on the victim's associate?"""
0.5;Mr. Tatsumi's wife\Nwas killed by her other lover?!
0.5;Judging from the scene\Nof the crime, it wasn't a robbery.
0.5;Our testimonies cleared\NTatsumi-sensei of all suspicion.
0.5;Damn it! I lost that case\Nthanks to whoever killed her!
0.5;There are too many things\Nabout this case that bother me!
0.5;The way Mr. Tatsumi\Nstalled the old man for an hour...
0.5;Why was he so\Nfixated on the time?
0.5;Was it mere coincidence that he\Nhad someone else pick up the phone?
0.5;I guess all the questions\Nstart from the hotel!
0.5;Similarly, the employee\Nelevator is over there.
0.5;The room next to his office?\NAs always?
0.5;They have a music box instead\Nof an alarm clock buzzer!
0.5;--the music box stopped\Nduring the phone call!
0.5;They each have a real\Nmusic box hooked up to a timer.
0.5;Definitive proof\Nthat Mr. Tatsumi killed her!
0.5;You knew we were going\Nsomewhere! Where were you?!
0.5;She was about\Nto divorce this guy
0.5;Assuming I had known,\Nwhy would I kill her?
0.5;As a lawyer, I've heard\Nabout scores of cases
0.5;Where were you between\N2:00 and 3:00 p.m.
0.5;I came here because\Nof Kazumi's letter...
0.5;"""I'll be waiting for you\Nat home at 2:30."
0.5;I rang the doorbell,\Nbut nobody answered, so I left!
0.5;Hirose-san. I'd like you\Nto come down to the station.
0.5;The real sore loser isn't\NHirose-san-- it's you, Tatsumi-sensei!
0.5;Are you saying\NMr. Tatsumi is the killer?
0.5;This will tarnish your name\Nas a great detective, Mori-san!
0.5;I could say the exact same\Nthing to you, Mr. Tatsumi.
0.5;It truly was an impressive\Ntrick of utilizing blind spots.
0.5;The place a body is found\Ndoesn't necessarily equate
0.5;In other words, the murder\Ndidn't take place here at your home,
0.5;The voice on the tape\Nof the phone call with Conan-kun
0.5;was professionally analyzed\Nand determined to be the victim's!
0.5;Because she called from the room\Nnext to Tatsumi-sensei's office,
0.5;made his wife wait in the guest\Nroom that he always uses for clients.
0.5;He then had her call the hotel\Nat a predetermined time
0.5;He made someone else\Nanswer the unconnected call.
0.5;Because nobody would ever suspect\Nthat the caller was in the very next room.
0.5;Immediately after\Nhis business with me ended,
0.5;he went next door\Nand killed his wife.
0.5;He put the body\Nin a laundry basket
0.5;and dropped it down\Na nearby laundry chute.
0.5;That was the hotel\Nemployees' break time
0.5;so there wasn't a soul to be\Nfound, was there, Tatsumi-sensei?
0.5;However, the bag\Nwith the body was stapled.
0.5;That was the staple found in\Nthe bathroom, Inspector Megure.
0.5;But why was the\Nbody in the bathtub?
0.5;that the trunk and the bathtub\Nare about the same size.
0.5;so he couldn't\Njust toss it in the house.
0.5;Then he pointed the finger at Hirose-san\Nwho was lured here by the fake letter,
0.5;and then he escaped suspicion\Nby having me vouch for him.
0.5;Where is your proof\Nthat I killed her?
0.5;No court of law could\Nmake me stand trial like this.
0.5;Inspector. There's something\NI'd like you to get right away.
0.5;That hotel uses this music box\Nin place of alarm clock buzzers.
0.5;In other words,\Nyour wife had set the alarm
0.5;but forgot to turn it off\Nwhen making the call.
0.5;Sorry, but music boxes like\Nthis can be found anywhere.
0.5;Any music boxes\Nwhere the body was found?
0.5;The killer could have run\Noff with it for whatever reason.
0.5;This is a recording of the music box\Nin the room next to Mr. Tatsumi's office!
0.5;That's right. The music box\Nin the next room over
0.5;is probably missing either\Na cylinder pin or a tooth!
0.5;In other words, it's the only music\Nbox like it in the world, Tatsumi-sensei!
0.5;Now then, let's hear the\Nphone recording one more time.
0.5;To think a lawyer would be\Nblackmailed by his own wife...
0.5;But because of my position, I'm often\Nprivy to corporate secrets and the like.
0.5;Some of it was illegal,\Nto be more precise.
0.5;a year's worth of this dirty money--\Nin the form of divorce compensation.
0.5;It's not that much when you\Nconsider you can keep your reputation.
0.5;But then she got\Ninvolved with that designer...
0.5;"""I'll do what you want,\Nbut on one condition."
0.5;"Call me at the specified time or\Nelse I won't pay the 200 million!"""
0.5;She would get\N200 million and her man!
0.5;You had the call\Nrecorded automatically,
0.5;but you should've listened to it\Nagain before giving it to the police.
0.5;Your trick to pull off the perfect crime\Nactually wound up proving your guilt.
0.5;No matter how good the lawyer,\Nthe moment of truth is always a gamble.
0.5;Until now,\NI'd never once lost that bet.
0.5;You may be a good lawyer,\Nbut you were a poor criminal.
0.5;Despite being tricked\Nand taken advantage of.
0.5;Now his reputation keeps\Ngetting better and better...
0.5;It was definitely\NMatsuo-san who did this!
0.5;But how did he go from the\Nstudio and back in four minutes?!
0.5;Aha! I've finally\Nfound the secret path!
0.5;I wouldn't want\Nthe criminal to leave
0.5;when the logic show's\Njust about to begin...

0.5;we've come to see the numerous \Nevents commemorating the event.

0.5;Kids, this my old friend \Nand the man who invited us,
0.5;Didn't you just eat three \NHida beef steaks, Genta-kun?
0.5;Oh, right. In that case, there's \Nsomewhere I'd like to go.
0.5;Since Nobunaga took the \Ncastle, it's been 400...

0.5;The Origami Squad Nobuna \NGaizers have arrived!

0.5;With all those heroes, the \Nworld must be super safe.
0.5;That was their signature move, the \NGaizer Triple Decker Knock Down!
0.5;That was crazy. I've never \Nseen Mitsuhiko like that.
0.5;We have a meeting to \Ndiscuss tomorrow's event.
0.5;Let's stop by a convenience store \Non the way back, Professor.
0.5;Mitsuhiko, are you sure you \Nwant to give up so easily?
0.5;But we're going to the \Nconvenience store after.
0.5;The professor used the old man's \Nname to get them to look into it.
0.5;We met during the world heritage \Nsite Onizawa Village case.
0.5;Could you give me the \Ndetails of the case again?
0.5;But Mitsuhiko's whereabouts \Nremained unknown, and...
0.5;but we still haven't been able \Nto get in touch with them.
0.5;The objects that were stolen include a \Nminiature solid gold Oda Nobunaga statue
0.5;They also took some ancient \Nmanuscripts with historical value.
0.5;If we don't hurry, they'll be sold on \Nthe black market and be sent overseas.
0.5;I didn't want to believe it, \Nbut the heroes are the thieves!
0.5;They're the worst! They \Nwon't get away with this!
0.5;and helping the elderly, are \Nwanted as suspects in a robbery.
0.5;Mitsuhiko, are you sure you \Nwant to give up so easily?
0.5;But we're going to the \Nconvenience store after.
0.5;Yeah, but he was right \Nhanded at the crime scene.
0.5;Blue and Green were switched \Nin their signature pose, too.
0.5;Yes, your plan to frame the \NNobuna Gaizers for a robbery.
0.5;You should've done more research if \Nyou wanted to frame them, mister.
0.5;Then there's another piece \Nof damning evidence.
0.5;You hit the security \Nguard at the crime scene.
0.5;We checked the costumes again \Nafter Agasa-san called.
0.5;Were the other impostors \Nemployees of that loan company?
0.5;It means if we don't hurry, \Nthey'll be silenced forever.
0.5;This morning the areas \Nthat were paved were...
0.5;The remaining impostors were arrested and \Nthe treasures of Gifu have been returned.
0.5;And the Nobuna Gaizers' \Nname has been cleared.
0.5;The Black Organization \Nmust be interested, too.
0.5;"And that piece of paper had \Nthe word ""nue"" written on it!"

0.5;If you made the code, \Nat least give us a hint.

0.5;Okay, then. I'm going to \Nclick the enter button.
0.5;we'll never know where the envelope \Ncontaining the marriage registration is.
0.5;Yumi-san entered an eight digit \Nnumber without hesitating.
0.5;Why did those characters appear \Nwhen you folded the code sheet?
0.5;The fact that he went out of his \Nway to copy the code sheet,
0.5;and that the sheet was in \Nthe trash can were hints.
0.5;What would have been obvious \Nif he hadn't made a copy?

0.5;of dog food company president Hinomiya \NAnna-san and arrived at a yacht harbor.
0.5;Right in front of us, Anna-san was shot \Nby a masked man, who then fled the scene.
0.5;Anna-san's ex-boyfriend Hyodo \NMakoto emerged as a suspect.
0.5;But Hyodo had an alibi.\NWhen the shooting took place,
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;There's no guarantee the same \Nperson killed Anna-san and Hyodo.
0.5;Aren't those the clothes worn by \Nthe culprit who shot Anna-san?
0.5;Maybe it's from the cake \Nthat was on the boat.
0.5;hid his clothes and gun here \Nafter shooting Anna-san.
0.5;Clothes and guns are evidence that tie \Na culprit directly to their crime.
0.5;He probably intended to come \Nback for them from the start.
0.5;Which means someone who \Nlearned of Hyodo's plan
0.5;The name Inamura is \Nembroidered onto the towel.
0.5;Maybe you should have Inamura-san, \NEnami-san, and Morishima-san come back.
0.5;Thank you. We already asked the \Nthree of them to come back here.
0.5;You idiot, the police \Nalready know to do that!
0.5;Anna-san must have made her dog \Nfood taste like something you love.
0.5;Inspector, does this mean it wasn't \NHyodo who killed the president?
0.5;Hyodo probably came to collect \Nthe gun and clothes he hid.
0.5;Inamura-san, you're certain \Nthat this is your gun?
0.5;I had it made to commemorate a \Nhole in one I made while golfing.
0.5;Wasn't a similar towel used \Nto wrap the champagne?
0.5;Yes. I was also thinking about giving \Nthe towel to the president as a present.
0.5;The culprit who shot Anna-san \Nused this as a mask.
0.5;I know. The towel was in \Nmy car when it was stolen.
0.5;Which means Hyodo stole not \Nonly your gun from your car,
0.5;but also your towel,\Nand used both in the crime.
0.5;I can only imagine that you \Nmust have helped Hyodo.
0.5;You can't be serious!\NYou think I'm his accomplice?
0.5;Once Anna-san was dead, \Nyou'd become the president.
0.5;And by killing off Hyodo, no \None else would know the truth.
0.5;And Hyodo was robbing the president's \Napartment when she was killed!
0.5;How can you accuse me \Nof being his accomplice?!
0.5;You said you awoke inside the locker and \Nsaw the culprit hiding in the cabin.
0.5;What if the culprit wasn't in the cabin in \Nthe whole time, but left to rob the apartment?
0.5;And by killing off Hyodo, you've \Ncommitted the perfect crime.
0.5;Hyodo conned Anna-san out \Nof a large sum of money.
0.5;Anna dragged him out of there and \Noffered him an especially high salary.
0.5;But maybe you were unsettled when you \Nheard Anna was secretly seeing Hyodo.
0.5;Recently I saw Anna walking around \Ntown in a leopard-print dress.
0.5;I remember seeing a leopard-print \Ndress in Anna-san's apartment.
0.5;I was taking her for a walk, \Nand she picked up some garbage.
0.5;Yesterday night, Sally-chan \Njumped on Hyodo's legs.
0.5;There was dog food scattered all over \Nthe cabin in which the culprit hid.
0.5;And the culprit, in other words, Hyodo, \Nstepped on the dog food with those shoes.
0.5;That's it. Because I fell \Nin dog food on the boat
0.5;Inamura-san, that dog food is \Nan original product, isn't it?
0.5;It's a new product that uses a special \Nfragrance not used by any other company.
0.5;If you analyze the fragments stuck \Nto the bottom of these shoes,
0.5;you'll find Hyodo was in the \Ncabin before shooting Anna-san.
0.5;Mori-kun, then who was robbing \NAnna-san's apartment at the same time?
0.5;Morishima-san, before coming to the \Nparty, did Anna-san go to a nail salon?
0.5;She loved wearing differently \Ncolored nails every day.
0.5;I found it strange that she showed \Nup to a party with scratched nails,
0.5;Her nails were scratched when \NSally-chan jumped on her.
0.5;If you examine Sally-chan's nails, you'll \Nfind nail polish matching Anna-san's nails.
0.5;But why would the victim \NAnna-san be his accomplice?
0.5;Naturally, Anna-san didn't believe \Nshe would be killed either.
0.5;What Anna-san wanted was to kill \Nher vice president Inamura-san.
0.5;Anna-san feared that Inamura-san \Nwould take over her company.
0.5;when the veteran Inamura-san \Ninterjected, she couldn't protest.
0.5;Honestly, I heard her complain \Nabout it more than once.
0.5;She thought Inamura-san only thought \Nof her as an advertisement.
0.5;I intended to support her \Nfor as long as I could!
0.5;I've never even thought of \Ntaking over the company!
0.5;But isn't that just your \Ndeduction—your imagination?
0.5;Didn't you know that Hyodo \Nused his silver tongue
0.5;to talk Anna-san into being \Nhis accomplice, Enami-san?
0.5;You lied about Anna-san wearing \Nthe leopard-print dress
0.5;I really did see her walking \Naround town in this dress!
0.5;She just bought that dress and \Nhadn't worn it outside yet.
0.5;After all, when I looked \Nunder the hem yesterday,
0.5;You were probably lying about \Nher walking around in it.
0.5;The president and Hyodo were \Nplanning to kill me, weren't they?
0.5;Enami-san, you were working \Nwith Hyodo from the start.
0.5;Then how do you explain \Nthe watch on your wrist?
0.5;you bought for Anna-san \Nat Enami-san's request?
0.5;But since she was shot immediately, \NI don't know what happened to it.
0.5;You must've thought it would be a waste \Nto break such an expensive watch.
0.5;When Detective Takagi showed Inamura-san \Nthe shotgun, you said something.
0.5;That detective said he \Ntook one shot to the head.
0.5;Not only that, but you accurately identified \Nthe section used to strike him.
0.5;you swung the shotgun \Ndown on Hyodo, killing him.
0.5;You saw Hyodo remove his \Nmask as he was fleeing.
0.5;He probably removed it unconsciously \Nbecause he had trouble breathing.
0.5;That's why you picked up the fallen towel from \Nthe deck and hid it with the culprit's clothes.
0.5;The towel you picked up \Nshould smell like champagne.
0.5;to remove the real towel from his \Nface, it had to have cake on it.
0.5;With Anna-san and Hyodo killed, \Nif Inamura-san was arrested,
0.5;I can't believe my plans \Nwere ruined by a poodle.
0.5;Even if I hadn't worked with Hyodo, \NI still would've killed Anna!

0.5;And I didn't send those comments \Nor messages to my fans!
0.5;That's right! Someone must \Nbe pretending to be her!
0.5;Risa is finally starting \Nto gain some popularity.
0.5;She wouldn't gain anything from \Ncausing a commotion like this!
0.5;I appreciate your cooperation, but don't \Nforget that the investigation is still ongoing.
0.5;You still think one of us is \Nworking with the kidnappers?
0.5;the kidnappers wouldn't have been \Nable to pull the fire alarm.
0.5;Yamane-san, you said you went out into the \Nhallway just before the concert started.
0.5;Yes. Like I said before, I just went to make \Na phone call. I didn't unlock the door.
0.5;Who on earth were you calling \Nwhen you should've been busy
0.5;The manager was calling Takeyama, \None of the kidnappers.
0.5;If you leave another threatening message, \Nyou won't get off with just a ban!
0.5;I'll beat the shit out of you \Nand turn you over the cops!
0.5;I've asked you so many \Ntimes to stop doing that.
0.5;I saved his number when I received \None of his phone threats.
0.5;But I couldn't stand the threat of violence \Nhe left just before a concert, so to be safe...
0.5;Was there anyone in the hallway \Nwhen you placed this call?
0.5;I couldn't see the fire \Nalarm from where I was.
0.5;Anyway, we need to figure out \Nwhere that place in the photo is.
0.5;I believe it's somewhere Takeyama and his \Naccomplice were illegally dumping garbage.
0.5;We've determine the service area \Nthe kidnappers called from.
0.5;The base station covers the area \Nfrom Beika Pass to Teimuzu Valley.
0.5;Have them search the area from the \Nskies with a helicopter immediately.
0.5;But places that people are likely to \Nillegally dump garbage are hard to spot.
0.5;I don't think you'll be able to find it \Nby searching at night with a helicopter.
0.5;And if the refrigerator is closed, she'll \Nrun out of oxygen in just a short amount of time.
0.5;We have a search team\Nof 500 men ready to go,
0.5;but they can't start until we \Nnarrow down the search area.
0.5;I'll show them the honest feelings \Nof their victim's father.
0.5;We have no choice but appeal to \Nthe consciences of the kidnappers.
0.5;I understand how you feel, but how \Non earth are you going to reach them?
0.5;Could you broadcast my message to \Nthe kidnappers on your program?
0.5;Sure, but we're a cable channel. \NOur viewership is limited.
0.5;It's unlikely that your message \Nwill reach the kidnappers.
0.5;Just sitting and waiting \Nwon't save Ran's life!
0.5;Ran-kun's life is on the \Nline. Give it your best shot!
0.5;Okay. Risa-san was originally \Npart of a group, huh?
0.5;They kept reforming their \Ngroup, but it never took off.
0.5;today someone was kidnapped \Nfrom Risa Purple-san's concert.
0.5;It's an emergency! Risa \NPurple has been kidnapped!
0.5;from the father of kidnapping victim Mori \NRan-san, Mori Kogoro-san, to the kidnappers.
0.5;I know you mistook my daughter \Nfor Risa-san and kidnapped her.
0.5;Though she doesn't tell her father anything, \NI'm sure she dreams of a happy future.
0.5;And you're trying to take that \Nfuture from her right now!
0.5;Please think calmly about this \Nand at least spare her life!
0.5;You may believe silencing my daughter will \Nallow you to escape, but you're wrong.
0.5;Because I have evidence of \Nthe real culprit's identity!
0.5;Before the concert, my daughter took \Npictures all over the concert hall.
0.5;it's very likely that she took pictures of\Nsomeone standing where no one should be.
0.5;But this should be enough for you to \Nunderstand what I'm talking about.
0.5;The true culprit should know \Nthose photos are solid evidence.
0.5;At dawn, the police will mobilize \Na 500 man search party.
0.5;They'll request assistance from the \Nfire department, mountain rescue,
0.5;But if they discover the corpse of \Nmy daughter then, you'll be finished!
0.5;You'll be burdened with a \Ncrime you can never atone for.
0.5;Please spare my daughter \Nbefore it comes to that.
0.5;I hope it reaches the \Nconsciences of the kidnappers.
0.5;Kogoro-no-ojisan made up that Ran-neechan \Ntook pictures that could serve as evidence.
0.5;It was a dangerous gamble, but \Nit's the only way we can save Ran.
0.5;Setting a trap is good and fine, but if the \Nreal culprit wasn't watching the broadcast...
0.5;They left evidence on\Nthis answering machine.
0.5;You should be worrying about \NRisa-chan, not your bonus.
0.5;I thought that ringtone \Nwas yours, Bianca-san.
0.5;When the manager was leaving a \Nmessage on the answering machine,
0.5;If you leave another threatening message, \Nyou won't get off with just a ban!
0.5;I'll beat the shit out of you \Nand turn you over the cops!
0.5;Bianca, what are you doing? \NIt's starting soon.
0.5;I will protect Risa-san with my life \Nno matter who dares to attack her.
0.5;No. Bianca said she might know where \NTakeyama's illegal dumping ground was,
0.5;You knew the concert hall would be \Nfilled with water from the sprinklers,
0.5;You've only ever worn platform sneakers \Nwhen you were an underground idol.
0.5;You were jealous that your \Njunior Risa-san became popular.
0.5;I thought if Risa was kidnapped, as the event\NMC, I would get attention and fame, too.
0.5;Even Shinichi was so worried he called \Nme while I was in the hospital.
0.5;Anyway, I didn't think you \Nloved me this much, Dad.
0.5;Despite what you might think, I was \Nan aspiring actor when I was younger.

0.5;Well then, I will come\Npick you up tomorrow.
0.5;"and giving all other guys\Nthe old ""no thank you"" routine!"
0.5;Then you'll go to\Nthe Valentine party, right?
0.5;I'll use my chocolate to melt\Neven your bone marrow!
0.5;You have someone to give\Nchocolate to then?
0.5;I wouldn't be making chocolate by hand\Nif I didn't have someone to give any to!
0.5;Now that I think about it,\Nthere was a guy by that name...
0.5;That's weird.\NConan-kun isn't here either.
0.5;Now then, let us introduce our\NBeika University tennis club
0.5;OK. I'm Katsuhiko Minagawa,\Nthe captain.
0.5;Sonoko-san. You're still young, but you\Nshouldn't go overboard like that...
0.5;She's really pretty but obviously\Nreally jealous too...
0.5;Come on. You really are\Ngloomy, you know that?
0.5;I'm Yoshimi Watanabe.\NNice to meet you.
0.5;the strong, yet sensitive,\NToshihide Wakamatsu!
0.5;She actually looks\Nlike she's having fun.
0.5;You certainly know\Nhow to flatter a woman!
0.5;Susumu! Go to your room!\NYou're disruptin' the party!
0.5;But he doesn't really look\Nlike Minagawa-san, does he?
0.5;How long is that stupid\NRan going to be here?!
0.5;I was just going to a friend's\Nhouse but then I got lost!
0.5;Yes. He's been staying at my house\Nlately for certain reasons.
0.5;You not hear me or something?!\NGet this party started!
0.5;Don't you think Minagawa-san's\Ngot a bit of an attitude problem?
0.5;It's good for guys\Nto be a little like that!
0.5;Watch! Minagawa-san's down for\Nthe count once he eats my chocolate!
0.5;You sure you didn't put\Npoison in it then?
0.5;must have hobbies like tea ceremony\Nand flower arrangement, right?
0.5;How could Ran-san do\Nanything so uncivilized?!
0.5;As if such a lovely and charming\Nwoman would ever be into karate!
0.5;It really pisses me off when you\Nfeel sorrier for him than me!
0.5;You mean to say you're\Nworse off than him?
0.5;You've become so reckless\Never since then!
0.5;I know enough! We grew up\Ntogether, after all!
0.5;I guess you really do\Nlike Yoshimi the best...
0.5;It should be OK, right?\NIt's just her hand...
0.5;Susumu! How many times\Ndo I have to tell you?!
0.5;No sweets! Your cavity\Nstill hasn't healed yet!
0.5;There's no reason for him to hurt\Nyou like that, no matter what!
0.5;Katsuhiko! It's 10 years too soon\Nfor you to challenge me!
0.5;Well, everyone has to be good\Nat something, I guess.
0.5;Ran-san must be sick of being\Nwith a guy with muscle for brains.
0.5;Why not think about other\Npeople's feelings for once?!
0.5;How about something\Nto work off that alcohol?
0.5;Ah, here it is!\NMrs. Minagawa's home-made cakes!
0.5;Katsuhiko. Aren't you going\Nto eat your cake?
0.5;Don't you think maybe\Nyou're smoking too much?
0.5;Which reminds me, do you have\Nany chocolate for me, Ran-san?
0.5;The cause appears to be agricultural\Nchemicals used as food poison.
0.5;He collapsed shortly after eating\Nyour chocolate, did he not?
0.5;It goes without saying that\Nthis case is an easy one.
0.5;I, the great detective Kogoro Mori,\Nhastened to the scene!
0.5;You poisoned the chocolate\Nin order to kill the victim!
0.5;Everything's too convenient\Nfor it to have been her.
0.5;Everyone's eaten the exact\Nsame things as the victim.
0.5;it would be impossible to tell\Nwhich ones the victim would eat.
0.5;Everyone drank coffee that\Ncame from the same pot.
0.5;there was a cigarette butt at\Nthe crime scene, wasn't there?
0.5;So this is the cigarette butt\Ndiscovered at the scene of the crime.
0.5;I saw it! When Minagawa-san\Nwent outside,
0.5;We can always find out if we examine\Nthe cigarette butt, you know!
0.5;That damn Katsuhiko was\Nalways making a fool of me!
0.5;With it, you can make anyone within\Nclose range go to sleep instantly.
0.5;His voice was Number 59,\Nif I remember correctly...
0.5;What are you talking about?\NHe's confessed to it, you know.
0.5;He did indeed plan to murder\Nthe victim, but he failed.
0.5;All of the victim's other cigarettes\Nin the house were unfiltered.
0.5;After receiving the\Ncigarettes from Naomichi,
0.5;the victim removed the filter\Nbefore lighting one up.
0.5;In other words, he didn't smoke\Nthe part that had the poison in it.
0.5;It was because you put\Npoison in the coffee
0.5;you rushed to give him some\Nof the cake and the antidote!
0.5;You knew that Katsuhiko-kun\Nprobably wouldn't eat the cake
0.5;Being the very first\Nperson on the scene,
0.5;you took the chocolate\Nhe partially ate
0.5;and replaced it with\Npoisoned chocolate!
0.5;All while trying to make\NYoshimi-san look guilty, of course.
0.5;Before the police came, you washed\Nthe coffee cups as quickly as possible.
0.5;detailed examination\Nwill still find the poison!
0.5;Even if there isn't\Nany left in the cups,
0.5;there will still be some\Nin the drain pipes.
0.5;Yoshimi-san's real chocolate bar,\Nwhich you hid in your kimono, that is.
0.5;How would I know that he would\Neat Yoshimi's chocolate?!
0.5;No! Katsuhiko's real parents\Ndied 7 years ago in an accident!
0.5;Then you, his father's sister,\Ntook him in!
0.5;Katsuhiko liked Yoshimi because\Nshe looked like his real mother.
0.5;That's how you knew for sure\Nthat he would eat her chocolate!
0.5;I just happened to see you\Nbuying chocolate one day
0.5;We desperately needed\NKatsuhiko's inheritance
0.5;because my husband's\Nbusiness went under!
0.5;I wanted to protect this house\Nand Susumu's happiness!
0.5;What should I do with\Nthis chocolate now?
0.5;I could give you a ride\Nhome if you want...
0.5;Sending 25 million yen along with toys\Nseems too much to be a prank.
0.5;And that letter... What does\Nit say they're coming for?!
0.5;You two were at the library where \NKid showed up, weren't you?
0.5;Kaito Kid disguised himself \Nas Professor Agasa?
0.5;He was bending his knees to make \Nhimself the professor's height.
0.5;The actual professor was \Nknocked out with a stun gun
0.5;He sounded and acted exactly \Nlike the professor.
0.5;Just once I'd like Kid to \Ndisguise himself as me.
0.5;This is Wakasa-sensei. She'll be my \Nassistant homeroom teacher starting today.
0.5;I-I'm ten years older than \NKobayashi-sensei, but...
0.5;We're playing dodge ball in \Nthe yard for fifth period PE.
0.5;So I thought I'd draw \Nsome lines during lunch.
0.5;There's hardly any in reserve \Nin the storehouse either.
0.5;You mean that rundown storage \Nshed that seems haunted?
0.5;I heard a teacher once got locked \Ninside and starved to death in there.
0.5;Do you want us to come with \Nyou because you're scared?
0.5;because of feng shui or something \Non the day of the graduation...
0.5;Conan-kun, you weren't here \Nfor the entrance ceremony.
0.5;We have Detective Boys badges \Nthat serve as transceivers, too.
0.5;It's time for the Detective \NBoys to search for lime!
0.5;Based on the condition of the \Nbones and the surroundings,
0.5;But it had lots of characters I've \Nnever seen before written on it.
0.5;There was a large crack \Non the back of the skull,
0.5;and it looks like they were \Ncarrying a large bag of lime.
0.5;They probably lost their footing \Nwhile trying to steal the bag of lime,
0.5;and died when they struck \Nthe back of their head
0.5;on the vaulting box at \Nthe bottom of the steps.
0.5;They murdered the man and \Nfled with 200 million yen
0.5;suspicious figures enter \NTeitan Elementary School.
0.5;Anyway, I'm surprised someone \Ndied in that old storage shed.
0.5;It's unfortunate the police \Ntook the code string with them.
0.5;It was a cipher used 2500 \Nyears ago by the Spartans.
0.5;wrap it around a rod, \Nand write something on it.
0.5;you can't read what was \Nwritten on it anymore.
0.5;I wish we could wrap the code written \Non that string around a rod and read it.
0.5;Haibara's printing the photo I took with \Nmy phone in the faculty office right now.
0.5;They let me print it when I said we were \Nusing it for a Chinese character quiz.
0.5;by wrapping it around the \Nhandles of the storage shed,
0.5;we should be able to read it if we wrap \Nit around a pen of about this thickness.
0.5;"The second character from the \Nleft is the ""e"" in Edogawa-kun."
0.5;But I've never seen the \Nother characters before.
0.5;Are we really meant to wrap \Nthat code around a rod?
0.5;We couldn't understand the code \NConan-kun made for us earlier
0.5;but we could read each individual \Ncharacter even when it was unwrapped.
0.5;But the code the skeleton \Nin the storage house had
0.5;was full of unrecognizable \Ncharacters even when unwrapped.
0.5;that are made up of two \Ncharacters put together?
0.5;"For example, the ""shima"" \Nin Kojima-kun's name"
0.5;"is made up of the ""mountain"" \Nand ""bird"" radicals."
0.5;And Edogawa-kun thought the \Ncharacters written on the code
0.5;were radicals and that they'd \Nmatch up and be legible
0.5;The right side of the code \Nhas lots of characters
0.5;"like ""fire"" and ""metal,"" \Nwhich are common left radicals."
0.5;the left and right sides so they'd \Nturn into legible characters.
0.5;But the only thing we can \Nread is the second character.
0.5;What are those dots and circles \Nat the end of the sentences?
0.5;"Couldn't it be ""something is"" \Nwith ""ga"" instead of ""wa?"""
0.5;The second character in the \Nthird sentence has sonant marks.
0.5;in the middle of their sentences \Nis personal preference.
0.5;Either way, we'll probably need \Nsomething else to crack the code.
0.5;I'm sorry, but could you put these \Nrulers away in the prep room?
0.5;You picked up a schedule \Nin the storage shed, right?
0.5;there's something wrong with \Nthis schedule, isn't there?
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The New \NTeacher's Skeleton Case, Part Two!"""
0.5;While visiting the Kawanakajima \Nbattlefield in Nagano,
0.5;we ran into Nagano Prefectural Police\NInspector Yamato and his associates,
0.5;we discovered a human head \Nfloating down the river.
0.5;The head that had a woodpecker's footprint\Npressed into its forehead with blood
0.5;belonged to Nagano Prefectural\NPolice Inspector Takeda.
0.5;Furthermore, Lieutenant \NKano of Takeda's squad
0.5;Sergeant Akiyama of Takeda's \Nsquad was murdered as well.
0.5;But Inspector Yamato \Nwould never kill someone!
0.5;We should prioritize \Njustice over emotion now.
0.5;If we let him get away \Nnow, we might regret it.
0.5;Don't go easy on him just \Nbecause you know him.
0.5;Think of him as a murderer who's \Nkilled three cops in a row.
0.5;who says they saw someone \Nwho looked like Yamato.
0.5;I'd like to go check it out, \Nbut no cars are available.
0.5;No. It's just that Saegusa-san \Nis a slightly reckless driver.
0.5;If the information's credible, \Nlet us know right away.
0.5;The god of war who will \Ndestroy the woodpecker.
0.5;With the same feelings we've \Nalways held still in our hearts,
0.5;As the case closes in on the truth, \Na surprising turn of events occurs.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""The Darkness of the \NPrefectural Police, Part Three!"""
0.5;Borrow Morofushi's fast car and \Nmeet me at the shack on Mt. Saijo!
0.5;Yeah. Based on what Detective \NYui said, probably.
0.5;that suspicious group that might exist \Ninside the Nagano Prefectural Police?
0.5;The three murder victims were \Nmembers of the Woodpecker Society.
0.5;But remember what Detective\NYui said earlier?
0.5;to commanders who died at\Nthe Battle of Kawanakajima.
0.5;There's no way they'd \Nform a group around that.
0.5;Besides, I heard that you're \Nthe one who told her that.
0.5;I didn't know the Woodpecker \NSociety was called X.
0.5;Takeda's most famous 24 are the \N24 Generals of Takeda Shingen.
0.5;Yes. The first victim \Nwhose head was cut off,
0.5;Detective Takeda Shigeru, was Shingen's \Nyounger brother Takeda Nobushige.
0.5;The second victim who was strangled \Nand hanged from the ceiling,
0.5;Lieutenant Kano Shoji, formerly \Nwent by the name Tsuchiya,
0.5;so he was Shingen's advisor \NTsuchiya Masatsugu.
0.5;And the third victim who had \Na rope tied around his neck
0.5;Sergeant Akiyama Shinsuke, \NAkiyama Nobutomo,
0.5;Inspector Morofushi said it was \Npossible if they imagined themselves
0.5;as the 24 Generals of Takeda and \Nwere looking for more members.
0.5;So the next victim is probably \NInspector Saegusa Mamoru,
0.5;whose name resembles that of Takeda army's \Nfoot soldier general Saegusa Moritomo.
0.5;then naturally tactician Yamamoto \NKansuke would be included as well.
0.5;Yeah. That's why Lieutenant Kano \Nsaid what he did at the shrine.
0.5;Which means the Takeda Squad \Nwas the Woodpecker Society.
0.5;But didn't Inspector \NSaegusa go out somewhere?
0.5;Yeah. The culprit probably \Ncalled him somewhere.
0.5;But didn't you say Detective Akiyama \Nfell off a cliff with a car?
0.5;Yeah. While he was falling, \Nhis body got caught on a tree.
0.5;The rope around his neck severed \Nit, and he fell off the cliff.
0.5;He probably gave a practice mannequin \Nfrom his family's salon his own haircut,
0.5;hid the head inside his hood, and released \Nit along with fake blood as he was falling.
0.5;B-But wasn't the rope connected to \Nthe car wrapped around his neck?
0.5;He was just holding the crisscrossed \Nrope in front of his neck.
0.5;And by setting up a headless corpse \Nwearing his clothes in a tree beforehand,
0.5;the people at the top of the cliff \Nwouldn't be able to see him,
0.5;making it look like his head had been \Nsevered and fallen to the bottom.
0.5;Inspector Takeda's head was \Nprobably cut off on Mt. Saijo.
0.5;Then what about the burned \Ncorpse found under the bridge?
0.5;That was probably the body \Nof the wanted robber.
0.5;and placing it along with the body, \Nhe was able to fool the DNA test.
0.5;The robber's head was probably inside the \Ncar that fell off the cliff and exploded.
0.5;Once it's burned, he'd be able to \Nmake us think it belonged to him.
0.5;Detective Yui said Inspector Yamato \Ncalled Detective Akiyama somewhere.
0.5;He e-mailed his own phone using Inspector\NTakeda's, his first victim's, phone,
0.5;making it look like Inspector \NYamato summoned him.
0.5;Then he added Inspector Yamato's \Nnumber to his blocked contacts,
0.5;to make it look like he was ensuring \Nthe message wouldn't be erased.
0.5;Inspector Yamato's fingerprints \Nwere found on the rope
0.5;Lieutenant Kano was hanged from two \Nloops of rope linked together like this.
0.5;While taking him down, Inspector \NYamato touched the upper rope.
0.5;But if you grab the rope around \Nhis neck and pull it through...
0.5;Detective Akiyama used this \Ntrick to switch the upper rope
0.5;that Inspector Yamato touched \Nwith the rope around his neck.
0.5;He called Lieutenant Kano's phone and \Ndid it while everyone was distracted.
0.5;That's why he fanned the flames between \NInspector Yamato and Inspector Morofushi, too.
0.5;and insist on investigating alone, \Nhe wouldn't be able to frame him.
0.5;They're both a bit contrarian, so they'll insult\Neach other if they're called great friends.
0.5;But weren't things tense between them since \Nbefore Detective Akiyama said anything?
0.5;Since the culprit was trying \Nto frame Inspector Yamato,
0.5;And Inspector Yamato chose to \Nact alone according to his plan,
0.5;From the eyewitness testimony, it was\Nobvious that he was trying to frame him,
0.5;claiming someone saw him near the \Nbridge where the crime took place.
0.5;and walked around using the \Nsame cane Inspector Yamato has.
0.5;He probably used elevator \Nshoes to increase his height.
0.5;But wouldn't Inspector Yamato acting alone \Nbe playing into the culprit's hands?
0.5;As long as he stays in there, \Nthe dash cam will prove his alibi.
0.5;This is all stuff Inspector \NMorofushi told me, though.
0.5;Didn't Inspector Saegusa take Inspector \NMorofushi's car to meet the culprit?
0.5;Hiding in the trunk was a \Nclever idea, Inspector Yamato.
0.5;use it to kill Saegusa, and make \Nit look like you killed each other.
0.5;And after burning Takeda's \Nbody, I'll disappear.
0.5;There's no way I'd sit naked in \Na place where I can't even move.
0.5;I've known since this morning when \NI heard about the eyewitness account
0.5;claiming a man pretending to be me \Nwas walking around near the river.
0.5;Only someone who knew I wouldn't be crossing \Nthat bridge this morning could've done that.
0.5;In other words, my friend \Nwho got high on drugs,
0.5;fired a gun in the city, and \Nwas shot dead by Takeda.
0.5;Or the surviving family of the \Nvictim struck by a stray bullet,
0.5;who knew I visit her grave every \Nmorning on the day of her death.
0.5;when a bullet from my friend's \Ngun pierced her forehead.
0.5;Aburakawa Shinsuke, you're the \Nsuspect in this serial murder case.
0.5;You left the woodpecker \Nfootprint on the foreheads
0.5;of the bodies because that was \Nwhere your sister was shot.
0.5;You deliberately made Kano-san realize this \Nso he'd go home and you could kill him.
0.5;Because I had no idea why you murdered \Nthem, I was waiting to see what you'd do.
0.5;I overheard you talking about Uehara, \Nand I was able to figure it out.
0.5;they had seized under the\Nname X to line their pockets.
0.5;Yes. I didn't know either until \NI changed my name to Akiyama,
0.5;and was invited to join the \NWoodpecker Society by Chief Takeda.
0.5;Then I learned that the gun that killed \NTsuyako was one of the guns they had sold!
0.5;It's your fault for having \Nsuch a stupid friend.
0.5;How many bullets can you \Navoid using that shield?
0.5;"""Without making a sound, they \Ncrossed the river at night."""
0.5;Like Uesugi Kenshin, who sniffed \Nout the Woodpecker Strategy,
0.5;we approached you without a sound \Nand have been watching you
0.5;Then the BOLO on Inspector Yamato and \Nthe decision to leave the body...
0.5;so you'd hear them so you'd let your \Nguard down and we could nail you here.
0.5;Morofushi's car will be a bit tight \Nwith the spare tire in the back.
0.5;We knew you'd act if you \Nknew where Yamato was.
0.5;Okay. It seems he'll have to be \Nquestioned thoroughly later,
0.5;and I saw the e-mail you sent \NInspector Morofushi, I...
0.5;That's what Yamamoto Kansuke said \Nwhen he charged into enemy lines.
0.5;You don't need to question \Nevery little thing I do.
0.5;I doubt you want the concern of a woman\Nwith a black mark on her romantic history.
0.5;What was it that you had \Nto do this afternoon?
0.5;I was seeing the grandma of my friend \Nwho went on a shooting spree.
0.5;His grave is in a remote \Narea with no cell reception.
0.5;He seems to have known about that \Nand used it against you, too.
0.5;is stuffing yourself with foods\Nthat can only be acquired locally.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Shadow Approaching Amuro."""

0.5;"the fossil was found in a layer \Nof earth 130 million years old."""
0.5;"""I was hoping I could visit you and \Nhave an in-depth conversation."""
0.5;At this rate, someone might discover \Nwe lied about the fossil's origins.
0.5;Don't be ridiculous!\NI'm not that influential!
0.5;You may not be influential, \Nbut you've got money.
0.5;After all, your political \Ncareer depends on it.
0.5;A suspicious duo have a \Nsuspicious conversation!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Well, your typical fossil \Nis much more plain-looking.
0.5;that comprises bones and shells \Nis replaced with minerals.
0.5;because it was replaced \Nwith a gemstone like opal.
0.5;I'll be going to America \Nto buy more next month.
0.5;The world's largest mineral fair \Nis held in Tucson, Arizona.
0.5;Just looking at beautiful \Nfossils makes me happy.
0.5;Hello, hello! Thank you for \Nmaking the trip out here.
0.5;Like you said, I've decided to \Nsettle the matter with money.
0.5;A journalist? Did you come \Nto write a story on us?
0.5;It's when the inside of a \Nconch shell becomes a jewel.
0.5;And they found that at \Nthe excavation site here?
0.5;Maybe ancient people thought the rabbit \Nin the moon had pooped on them.
0.5;We're thinking of making \Nit the village's symbol.
0.5;Ogami-san, could I take a look at the site \Nwhere the moon's droppings was found later?
0.5;There's actually something \NI'd like to tell you.
0.5;Different types of fossils are \Nfound in different layers of earth.
0.5;All you'll find here are \Nclam or oyster fossils.
0.5;But apparently they've found ornithomimus \Ndinosaur bones and footprints before.
0.5;The only shortcut to finding \Ngood fossils is to dig a lot.
0.5;As long as you dig with passion, \Nthe fossils will find you.
0.5;But I thought you were sponsoring \Nthe moon's droppings PR program.
0.5;I've been wondering whether \Nor not I should tell you.
0.5;The victim was Oninohamura Village lodge \N& fossil museum owner Ogami Akira-san.
0.5;The victim didn't eat or drink anything \Nduring the fossil excavation tour.
0.5;Which means someone poisoned \Nthe bathroom beforehand
0.5;That's right. Besides, why would \Nsomeone choose to kill him like that?
0.5;Excuse me, but I don't think \Nthis is a criminal case.
0.5;Ogami-kun seemed worried about \Nsomething for a few days now.
0.5;Yes. He said he couldn't \Nsleep and wanted to die.
0.5;The truth is, I came to expose that \Nthat fossil's origins were faked.
0.5;I believe the moon's droppings were \Nfound at a different excavation site.
0.5;So Ogami-san killed himself because \Nhe thought he'd be discovered?
0.5;He said there was something \Nhe wanted to confess to me.
0.5;Perhaps he couldn't bear \Nthe guilt any longer.
0.5;Nakatani-san knows barely \Nanything about fossils.
0.5;But my village renewal \Nplan is already in motion.
0.5;I thought I'd finally get to \Ngloriously solve a case again.
0.5;But Ogami-san was excited \Nfor his trip next month.
0.5;Would someone considering \Nsuicide buy plane tickets?
0.5;Maybe he felt like dying after \Nhe made his reservation.
0.5;It's not too late to decide that until after \Nwe determine if there's poison present or not.
0.5;We didn't find anything on places the \Nvictim was likely to have touched.
0.5;Excuse me, but there's \Nsomething I forgot to report.
0.5;We didn't find poison on the \Nvictim's sanitary wipes,
0.5;Didn't I say we're looking \Nfor a cyanide compound?
0.5;Okay, everyone. Shall we \Nsearch the lodge next?
0.5;Since we didn't find any \Nsigns of poison at the lodge,
0.5;I finally figured out how the \Nculprit killed Ogami-san.
0.5;But, Agasa-san, we didn't \Nfind poison anywhere.
0.5;It's hard to believe the victim \Nwould've drunk the poison himself.
0.5;Yes, but aren't there methods of taking in \Npoisons besides swallowing or licking them?
0.5;but actually, the compound \Nitself is not poisonous.
0.5;it reacts with your stomach \Nacid, creating a poisonous gas.
0.5;That's why people say swallowing \Ncyanide compounds kill you.
0.5;The culprit probably dissolved the \Ncyanide compound in the toilet bowl.
0.5;Come to think of it, there was \Nhydrochloric acid at the lodge.
0.5;Adding hydrochloric acid would \Nproduce a poisonous gas immediately.
0.5;When he wiped his hands with \Na sanitary wipe and tossed it.
0.5;Forensics said the sheet was \Nslightly more acidic than normal.
0.5;The culprit added the diluted hydrochloric \Nacid to the sanitary wipes.
0.5;reacted with the acid in the sanitary \Nwipes and created a poisonous gas.
0.5;the cyanide compound would \Nbe harmlessly flushed away.
0.5;The culprit most likely \Ntold Ogami-san they hid
0.5;something valuable in the \Nbathroom so he'd search it.
0.5;The clean-freak Ogami-san \Nused the sanitary wipes
0.5;The poisonous gas was \Nformed, and Ogami-san died.
0.5;The only one who knew \NOgami-san was a clean-freak
0.5;Do you have any proof that \NOgami inhaled a poisonous gas?
0.5;Like the victim, these bugs \Nwere poisoned with cyanide.
0.5;The bugs gathered around the fan \Nmust have inhaled the poisonous gas.
0.5;Fearing the poisonous gas would \Nremain inside the bathroom,
0.5;you must have left the \Nfan on, but it backfired.
0.5;You're the one who lied about the moon's \Ndroppings coming from this village, too.
0.5;We came up with the idea together,\Nbut he tried to place all the blame on me.
0.5;So I told him I had a tape of evidence \Nand told him to come to the bathroom.
0.5;If I didn't kill him, my political \Ncareer would've been over.
0.5;If that's true, that's a \Nmajor discovery, Genta.

0.5;Oh! That scene where you throw\Nyourself into the lake was amazing!
0.5;"You fell straight for\Nthe lake, like, ""Whoosh!"""

0.5;Umm, where might the\Nrestroom be? It's so chilly outside...
0.5;At the far end of\Nthe hall, on the left.
0.5;Say, Ran-neechan. Yoko-san\Nsaid this is her first time here, right?
0.5;So how did she know\Nwhere the bathroom was?
0.5;Oh, you're so curious\Nabout everything, Conan-kun!
0.5;Aren't bathrooms usually\Nalways in the same general area?
0.5;T-The Snow Woman!\NConan-kun! The Snow Woman!
0.5;You were just so\Nafraid of the Snow Woman
0.5;So I'd like to schedule\Na body massage and a facial!
0.5;Yes. Akiko-san wanted\Nto ski for a little bit longer.
0.5;Akiko-san not being well...\NIs she sick somehow?
0.5;Akiko-san was coughing.\NIs she all right?
0.5;Yes. She doesn't seem\Nto have an appetite, though.
0.5;Yes, go right ahead!\NYou have it to yourselves until 8:00!
0.5;You can take a bath\Nafter 8:00, Ran-chan!
0.5;And you have the\Nmen's bath all to yourselves!
0.5;Akiko-san. Are you all right?\NYou really should see a doctor.
0.5;Yes, I'll do that.\NI think I'll get out for now.
0.5;What do you say to\Nhaving an after-bath drink?
0.5;Just like on TV, Akiko-san's\Ngoing to play the main character!
0.5;Yes, but of course!\NPlease come and watch!
0.5;Oh, I guess there\Nwasn't very much in here.
0.5;I have some whiskey in\Nmy room, if you'd prefer that!
0.5;Let's drink a little more!\NI'll go get it!
0.5;Actually, it's apparently at\Nthe bottom of Akiko-san's suitcase,
0.5;so she said she'll\Nbring it to us in a bit.
0.5;Well, Ran-san.\NGo on ahead to the bath.
0.5;I'm going to check on\NAkiko-san real quick first.
0.5;I don't seem to remember that\Ndoll being there when I looked earlier.
0.5;I really did! She was\Nwearing a white kimono!
0.5;I checked around the building,\Nbut I couldn't find her!
0.5;Then, when I checked\Nour room closer, I found that!
0.5;I don't know! But her strange\Ncoughing had her worried, too!
0.5;She may have been\Nsecretly worried she had cancer too.
0.5;It's very cold out! We need to\Nfind Akiko-san as quickly as possible!
0.5;Alright! We're going out to\Nsearch, too! Get ready right away!
0.5;But, mister! Akiko-san made\Na beauty salon appointment!
0.5;Would someone committing suicide\Nreally schedule an appointment?
0.5;She probably decided to kill\Nherself in the spur of the moment!
0.5;Akiko-san was found dead,\Nwearing her Snow Woman costume.
0.5;I guess there's no doubt\Nshe is Kinoshita Akiko-san.
0.5;I'm Mori Kogoro, a detective.\NI was staying in the same lodge.
0.5;Actually, there was a sedative\Nbottle lying next to Akiko-san.
0.5;Akiko-san brought the\Nwhiskey after 10:00 pm.
0.5;I think the Snow Woman\NI saw was probably Akiko-san.
0.5;This is how the scene\Nlooked when we found her.
0.5;help from the Great Detective\NMori probably won't be needed.
0.5;Say. Where is the previous\Nowner of this lodge now?
0.5;I'm going to send the body\Noff for mandatory autopsy now.
0.5;Kinoshita Akiko-san's death\Nwas a murder, not a suicide!
0.5;Mori-san! What evidence do\Nyou have it was a murder?!
0.5;Look closer at the photographs\Nfrom when her body was found.
0.5;Akiko-san's hair is inside\Nthe collar of the kimono.
0.5;Mori-san! You know Akiko-san\Nwasn't in a normal state of mind!
0.5;I doubt she worried about her\Nhair when putting on the kimono!
0.5;Detective Kawada.\NPlease look at the photographs.
0.5;It appears her body was\Nburied quite deeply in the snow.
0.5;The snow started yesterday around\N5:00 pm and ended around 8:00.
0.5;If Akiko-san had killed\Nherself after 10:00 last night,
0.5;her body wouldn't have\Nbeen buried in that much snow.
0.5;And one other thing.\NLook closely at Akiko-san's face.
0.5;Akiko-san was most likely given\Nthe sedative without her realizing it.
0.5;And no one else but you\Ncould have done that, Yoko-san!
0.5;But, Mori-san! You all\Nsaw Akiko-san last night!
0.5;What we saw was\Nyou acting as Akiko-san.
0.5;You were the one\Nwho invited Akiko-san skiing
0.5;Because it would be easiest\Nto play two people at once here.
0.5;After killing her, you needed\Nto make it appear she was still alive.
0.5;You worked here part-time one\Nwinter during your student days.
0.5;The previous owner\Nremembered your name.
0.5;But what you didn't count on\Nwas the snow stopping soon after.
0.5;Ran. The Snow Woman you\Nsaw our first day here was Yoko-san.
0.5;She covered herself with a white\Nkimono to keep from standing out
0.5;one for Akiko-san and one\Nfor Yoko-san, the stuntwoman.
0.5;She buried one of\Nthem in the snow in advance.
0.5;Then, the following day,\Nyesterday evening to be precise,
0.5;Then you returned here\Nas if nothing had happened.
0.5;You disguised yourself as her\Nas soon as you returned to your room.
0.5;To make it seem like the\Ndead Akiko-san was still quite alive.
0.5;You climbed to the roof via the\Npersimmon tree outside your window.
0.5;You then put on Akiko-san's\Nski boots, which you had hidden,
0.5;You also played the role of two\Npeople for us in the open-air bath.
0.5;You, if anyone, can\Nimitate Akiko-san's voice.
0.5;You were pretending to be\NAkiko-san as she strode off to die,
0.5;to make it look like\Nshe had committed suicide
0.5;and that she had still\Nbeen alive at that point.
0.5;Then what about the\Nwhiskey she brought us?
0.5;Yes, that was another act of yours.\NWe never saw Akiko-san's face.
0.5;You chose this lodge\Nfor one other reason:
0.5;You later returned\Nthe doll to its platform
0.5;In other words, you used\Nthe doll to fill in for Akiko-san.
0.5;Akiko-san's fingerprints\Nshould be missing from the bottle.
0.5;And that's more proof than\Nanything that she no longer existed.
0.5;I made it to the final audition\Nof my very first drama role,

0.5;It was sunny today, and \Nthe weather's really good.

0.5;Conan-kun, you know something \Nabout everything.
0.5;You've got no dreams or \Nsense of romance, kid.
0.5;When she learned it referred \Nto the stars, she said,
0.5;"""I'm so embarrassed! We're going stargazing \Ntonight!"" and dug out her binoculars."
0.5;When the countdown reaches zero, use your \Ndetective skills to produce an answer!
0.5;High school girl detective \NSonoko is fired up!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;I found the North Star and was \Nlooking directly beneath it.
0.5;But, Sonoko, were you able to tell at a \Nglance if it was a human hand or a doll's?
0.5;And could you have seen that flowerbed \Nfrom the top of the slide?
0.5;Since you can't see it from here, \Nyou couldn't see here from there.
0.5;The fastest way to his building \Nis to cut through mine.
0.5;Sorry for interrupting you \Nin the middle of shopping.
0.5;We get some willful clients \Nsometimes. It's a hassle.
0.5;His work means he's good \Nat designing flowerbeds,
0.5;He's repairing the front of \Nthis building in the meantime.
0.5;She always keeps her phone on her \Nwhen she goes out. That's odd.
0.5;If what I saw was on the roof, \Nthen the body's buried up there.
0.5;The flowerbeds have the same design, but \Nsince they're on the roof, the dirt's too shallow.
0.5;N-No, but that hand definitely \Ndidn't belong to a living person.
0.5;The water pipe under the \Nstreet out front broke.
0.5;Since it was after Rika-kun went \Nshopping, it must've been after 6:30.
0.5;Someone must've dug up \Nthe dirt to bury a body.
0.5;Does that mean the culprit \Ntook the body somewhere?
0.5;By the time Sonoko looked \Nthrough her binoculars,
0.5;The body of Yoshimura's wife \Nis still inside the building!
0.5;The wife was murdered after \Nthe director called her.
0.5;When they failed to bury \Nthe body in the flowerbed,
0.5;In other words, the body should \Nstill be hidden in this building!
0.5;You can't hide a person\Nin there, Sonoko-neechan.
0.5;We searched everywhere \Nbut didn't find anything.
0.5;This alleyway will take \Nyou out to the street.
0.5;Besides, even if there was \Na body, who killed them?
0.5;It's weird how he got so angry \Nand denied that there was a body.
0.5;Besides, he knew the dirt \Non the roof was too shallow.
0.5;she stopped at the neighboring \Nbuilding and quickly took care of it?
0.5;But she was asked to return \Nto the studio by Sasaki-san.
0.5;Sasaki-san would've found \Nher if she came downstairs.
0.5;Maybe the hand you saw belonged \Nto a mannequin and not a person.
0.5;neither Sasaki-san nor Minakami-san \Ncould've hidden it.
0.5;It'd be different story if there were a \Nbridge connecting the two buildings though.
0.5;You'll be in big trouble if \Nthe director finds you again.
0.5;I saw the shadow of the bridge \Nconnecting the two buildings.
0.5;The culprit was able to return to the \Nflowerbed and dispose of the body.
0.5;I took this key without the \Ndirector's permission, so be quiet.
0.5;the culprit had to return \Nto the Sasaki building.
0.5;So they built a bridge \Nbetween the two buildings
0.5;using the scaffolding for \Nthe Yoshimura building repairs.
0.5;of the Yoshimura building when \Nthey were finished with it
0.5;by the time we got to the roof \Nof the Yoshimura building,
0.5;That's right. The culprit \Nis Sasaki-san's assistant,
0.5;The culprit must've been troubled since \Nthey couldn't transport the body by car
0.5;like they planned because of \Nthe water pipe construction.
0.5;It looked really expensive, \Nso they must've wanted it.
0.5;If the culprit still has the ring on them, \Nthat would be an important piece of evidence.
0.5;Sonoko-neechan and Minakami-san \Nare on the roof.
0.5;The body would be found by \Nmorning if they hid it here.
0.5;No. If the street repairs are \Nfinished during the night,
0.5;Nanae paid to establish \Nher husband's company.
0.5;Naturally she assumed her \Nhusband obeyed her whims.
0.5;The culprit was unconscious \Nwhen she was arrested.
0.5;Anyway, I'm impressed that \Nyou figured out who did it.
0.5;You must be a genius to have \Nfigured out that trick.
0.5;Someday I'd like to build a mannequin \Nof you striking a jaunty pose.

0.5;Do you know a patient\Nnamed Kusuda Rikumichi?
0.5;What would you do if someone suddenly\Nasked if you knew someone by name?
0.5;Well, I'd probably respond\Nlike those ladies did.

0.5;You knew he was a stranger\Nbased only on his name.
0.5;Some people only know\Nothers by a nickname.

0.5;with two of her high school\Nclassmates to see Kosaka Juri,
0.5;The cause of death seems to be\Nasphyxiation caused by cyanide poison.
0.5;and they always held tea parties\Nwhen the four of them got together.
0.5;But the victim drank several cups\Nof tea without any problem
0.5;It's possible she had been made to\Nswallow a poison capsule beforehand.
0.5;Then it's possible the crime\Nwasn't committed here.
0.5;The phone dropped over here\Nhad lots of pictures on it,
0.5;but the dead lady has\Nchopsticks in her right hand.
0.5;It's normal for people to hold\Nchopsticks in their right hand.
0.5;Doesn't that mean she was\Ndrinking tea with her left hand?
0.5;It's because she had\Nsomething in her right hand.
0.5;For example, she may have been\Nlooking at pictures on her phone.
0.5;When people focus on one\Nthing, they ignore all others.
0.5;Even if the position of the cup\Nor its handle were changed,
0.5;The culprit must have used this tendency\Nto make the victim drink the poison
0.5;Putting poison in your own cup and\Nswitching it with the victim's
0.5;is safer than directly\Npoisoning the victim's cup.
0.5;so it would be easy to\Nadjust the cups' positions.
0.5;And look closely at the\Ncolor of everyone's tea.
0.5;From right to left, there's\Nbrown, blue, and yellow.
0.5;there must be a container or\Nbag used to contain the poison.
0.5;Maybe a thorough search of the\Nroom will turn up something.
0.5;The culprit may still have\Nit on their person, too.

0.5;But all I did was put the tea\Nbags in cups and add water.
0.5;Happo-san and Beppu-san got\Nthe cups out of the cupboard.

0.5;As the person who suggested you compare\Nteas and then made the tea,
0.5;and Suto-san drank nearly half \Nher tea before she collapsed.

0.5;Juri, who knows more about\Ntea than I do, was giggling.

0.5;In other words, everyone\Nhad motive to kill the victim.
0.5;Did anyone leave the room once\Nyou started drinking tea?
0.5;I believe Juri and Reina were\Nin the room the whole time.
0.5;She said she keeps them sparkling\Nclean with baking soda.
0.5;That means she's the only one who\Ncould have poisoned the victim's tea.

0.5;They're in a car, you know!\NIt'll be hopeless with that skateboard!
0.5;The professor made this for me--\Nit's no ordinary skateboard!
0.5;It's equipped with a\Nhigh-performance turbo engine!
0.5;But it's solar powered, so you can\Nonly use it when the sun is out.
0.5;Are you stupid?\NYou guys wait here!
0.5;That car belongs to\Na couple of murderers!
0.5;This car's weird, it keeps\Nmoving and then stopping!

0.5;Yeah. But it's not\Nthe same place as before.
0.5;I don't hear those\Nweird sounds anymore,
0.5;Hold on. If they're in a\Ntraffic jam up ahead, then...
0.5;There sure have been a lot\Nof police cars passing by...
0.5;...the kidnappers appear to have\Nescaped to the city of Beika.
0.5;The authorities have\Nformed a police cordon
0.5;and are trying as hard\Nas possible to arrest them.
0.5;Ayumi-chan! Have you\Nheard any police cars?!
0.5;Yeah! About 3 of them passed\Nby when we were stopped!
0.5;There's no doubt about it!\NThey've set up an inspection checkpoint!
0.5;Probably where the roads converge\Nright before the freeway starts--
0.5;You idiot! They wouldn't dare\Ngo through the checkpoint!
0.5;They'd obviously take a side street\Nto get out of Beika
0.5;Where are they?\NIt's already been 5 minutes...
0.5;Ayumi-chan! Is the car stopped\Nright now? Or is it moving?
0.5;No, these things have a\Nbroadcast radius of 20 kilometers!
0.5;There's no way they could've\Ngone that far in 5 minutes!
0.5;Maybe she's in a tunnel\Nor something?!
0.5;No, they'd have to pass through the\Ninspection point and go over the bridge
0.5;Which means they must be inside\Na building that disrupts our signals!
0.5;You don't think it's\Ntheir hideout, do you?!
0.5;In that case,\Nthey're like rats in a trap!
0.5;She's seen our faces.\NWe can't leave her alive!
0.5;you'd be there to protect me,\Nwouldn't you, Conan-kun?
0.5;Why wouldn't you say anything,\Nyou jerk?!
0.5;The car's so loud that\NI can't hear their voices!
0.5;No! There was this roaring sound\Nand then you stopped replying to me!
0.5;Roaring sound? So they\Nwere in the tunnel?!
0.5;But how did they pass\Nthrough the checkpoint?!
0.5;The skateboard'll stop\Nsoon if we don't hurry!

0.5;They're the ones kidnapping\Nand killing little girls!
0.5;Hey, did you hear\Nanything strange just now?
0.5;It's probably just a stray cat.\NNo need to get worked up!
0.5;We have to do something\Nbefore we stop altogether!
0.5;Who cares?! Let's just get her\Nout of there and split!
0.5;You're the ones who've been kidnapping\Nand murdering little girls!

0.5;No problem. It's Sunday. I didn't \Nhave anything else to do.
0.5;The semifinal and final matches \Nwill begin after lunch at 2PM.
0.5;We can go to one of the fast food \Nplaces we saw on the way here.
0.5;The bathroom outside the north \Nentrance should be less crowded.
0.5;I believe he'll make it to the finals, \Nbut winning may be a bit difficult.
0.5;but there's another very strong \Nstudent in the tournament.
0.5;If you're planning to practice \Nhere before your match, don't.
0.5;I was listening to the sounds \Nof the kendo tournament.
0.5;I was listening to the sounds \Nthat can be heard out here
0.5;I used to practice kendo \Nwhen I was young, too.
0.5;Until four years ago, I used \Nto watch from the stands,
0.5;I started listening to the \Ntournaments alone here.
0.5;Th-Then the person who approached \Nme after I heard the groan
0.5;I didn't hear the voice of the \Nperson they were speaking to,
0.5;so they were probably on \Nthe phone with someone.
0.5;Do you know which way the killer \Nwent after they approached you?
0.5;but after that, I don't think anyone \Nexited the bathroom and walked past me.
0.5;The killer told their accomplice \Nto bring them a new blade.
0.5;It sounds like they still \Nhave another target.
0.5;It's better for us to call the \Npolice and keep watch here.
0.5;There's a dead man next to the \Nbathroom at the Toto Gymnasium.
0.5;this looks like the work \Nof a rather skilled swordsman.
0.5;You said the person who attacked this \Nman might be a skilled swordsman.
0.5;It certainly looks like he was \Ncut down by a single blow.
0.5;I figured the killer must be pretty skilled \Nto kill a man like that with a single blow.
0.5;Anyway, I just came to get some practice \Nswings in before my match against you.
0.5;I wasn't expecting you to be here, \Nmuch less caught up in a murder.
0.5;They called someone on the \Nphone and said the following:
0.5;but since they were speaking \Nquietly, I couldn't hear them.
0.5;According to you, after killing the \Nvictim, they headed to the bathroom.
0.5;But by the time Ran-chan and Conan-kun \Ncame here and discovered the body,
0.5;I'll check the women's room. \NTakagi-kun, check the men's room.
0.5;And we frequently faced \Neach other in tournaments.
0.5;Hmm? You didn't kill him because \Nyou couldn't win, did you?
0.5;But there was a photo of you \Nwith this man on his phone.
0.5;Come to think of it, Nukitani-san \Noften mentioned...
0.5;...that he was being hit on by a student who \Nwas a former Self-Defense Force official.
0.5;A student? Does that mean you \Nused to practice kendo, too?
0.5;Nukitani-sensei was the gym teacher \Nand adviser of the kendo club.
0.5;B-Because I don't want to get \Ninvolved in the case, obviously.
0.5;By the time I walked past here, Nukitani-sensei \Nwas already bleeding from his neck and dead.
0.5;I didn't have time to use the bathroom \Nthis morning, so I was in a hurry.
0.5;I was in a hurry because I \Nwas about to wet myself, too.
0.5;But I've never seen that man, and \NI've never done kendo before.
0.5;I saw you bragging to your lady \Nfriend while you were having tea
0.5;"You said, ""I wish I could've shown you \Nthe victory pose I struck after I won."""
0.5;You were arguing with Nukitani-sensei \Nwho was sitting next to you.
0.5;And I remember how the woman with you left \Nyou there with a disgusted look on her face.
0.5;You said you'd kill yourself or someone \Nelse if he didn't leave his wife.
0.5;was arguing with Nukitani \Nafter yesterday's final team match.
0.5;When I said his refereeing \Nhad been a little lax lately,
0.5;he said to hold my complaints \Nuntil after I'd beaten him.
0.5;In other words, you all had a \Nmotive to kill Nukitani-san.
0.5;Can't we determine the killer \Nby asking this old man?
0.5;You heard the request for a new \Nbox cutter before the groan?
0.5;Then the person who brought \Nthe box cutter killed him?
0.5;Who's the last person in \Nthe victim's call history?
0.5;It's possible the killer erased \Nthemselves from his call history.
0.5;Maybe the killer was wearing them \Nwhen they killed Nukitani-san.
0.5;They're right between the \Nmen's and women's bathrooms.
0.5;Isn't that a set of Kyoto \NSenshin High School armor?
0.5;a first-year said our spare \Narmor and uniform were missing.
0.5;A spare set? Then it must've \Nbeen worn by a bunch of guys.
0.5;I was asked to practice with \Nsomeone before their match.
0.5;then it'll be difficult to determine \Nthe killer's identity using DNA.
0.5;Yeah. Since the uniform can be worn over \Nyour clothes, we can't expect much.
0.5;In any case, tell the tournament \Norganizer to put the matches on hold.
0.5;There's something I've got to say \Nto her after I win this tournament!
0.5;We've got forty minutes \Nbefore the matches start.
0.5;We just need to solve the \Ncase before then, right?
0.5;but did you just say something \Nabout winning the tournament?
0.5;That means if Hattori-kun \Nwins this tournament
0.5;he's going to confess his \Nfeelings to Kazuha-chan?
0.5;Amagi Tatsuya-san, a man alienated from \Nhis entire neighborhood, was murdered.

0.5;X probably chose to act at night \Nbecause they overhead that.
0.5;Kogoro-no-ojisan told me \Nto ask, so I don't know.
0.5;but it's likely either \NFukuda-san or Ezaki-san is X.
0.5;In any case, I need to confirm \Ntheir alibis for last night.
0.5;I'll start with the man \Nwho discovered the body...
0.5;for a weapon because you knew \NBando-san had a fear of needles.
0.5;If you go by that logic, \Nthere's no end to it.
0.5;finally did something useful \Nfor the neighborhood.
0.5;How convenient that he \Nstabbed that awful nuisance.
0.5;Ezaki Hiro-san, who pestered neighborhood \Nassociation president Bando-san
0.5;Ezaki-san must've run into trouble with Chino-san\Nthrough the college, and out of spite...

0.5;I asked the waitress Koyuki-san \Nwho was at the café yesterday.
0.5;Of the people there, Fukuda-san \Nis particularly suspect.
0.5;Perhaps he resented Bando-san \Nfor not doing anything,
0.5;despite being the neighborhood \Nassociation president.
0.5;Which means the next \Nsuspicious character is...
0.5;In the first place, we can't narrow it \Ndown to only Fukuda-san and Ezaki-san.
0.5;It's possible Fukuda-san's wife or \NEzaki Hiro-san's friends did it.

0.5;X killed Amagi Tatsuya-san \Nand Bando Hikoichi-san,

0.5;But they faced a fundamental \Nproblem in framing Chino-san.
0.5;It's not possible to frame \NChino-san without a motive.
0.5;Chino-san examined the contents of \Nthe storehouse at Bando-san's mansion,
0.5;I'm going to lock myself in my \Nstudy and stay up all night again.
0.5;They waited for an opportunity \Nto swap Chino-san's lighter
0.5;Since Chino-san would have \Nno one to verify his alibi,
0.5;Then they waited for Amagi-san's \Nbody to be discovered.
0.5;Naturally, the police suspected \NBando-san when they found his card.
0.5;I don't think that's what \Nhappened, detectives.
0.5;They appeared before the police \Nas a well-informed source.
0.5;there was indeed a treasure \Nin Bando-san's storehouse,

0.5;The man responsible for judging \Nall those submissions was...

0.5;I'm impressed that you were \Nable to solve the mystery.
0.5;There's no evidence, so it's \Nall just my conjecture.
0.5;Agatha Christie's story involved \Nnot just A, B, and C, but also D.
0.5;It was a hint that we should \Nalso consider a D in this case.
0.5;You turned the mystery you \Ncame up with into a weapon.
0.5;You left us hints to solve \Nthe mystery, but those...

0.5;That's the roof above\Nthe collection room...
0.5;The collection room didn't smell\Nlike oil paint after the incident!
0.5;Was that stake not\Nthe source of the smell?
0.5;Let's first organize what\Nwe know about the incident.
0.5;First, at around 8:30,\NMr. Dorakura went to the study
0.5;and Tadokoro-san, Ran, and Conan\Nwent to the collection room
0.5;At that time, the stake used as\Nthe murder weapon was still there.

0.5;Moreover, Ran confirmed that all\Nthe windows in the collection room
0.5;In short, the only way into the\Nroom was from the living room.
0.5;Yes. At around 8:50, I left the\Nwine and film and left the study.
0.5;Did anything seem\Nodd about Mr. Dorakura then?
0.5;You returned to the living\Nroom shortly after 9:00,

0.5;Even if I did, there's\Na reason I couldn't kill him!
0.5;I have a sister named Kaori,\Nwho's ten years younger than me.
0.5;She was born with\Na slightly-faulty heart,
0.5;and as our parents\Ndied when she was young,
0.5;I wasn't able to get\Nher decent medical help.
0.5;But, thanks to Dorakura-sensei,\Nshe's now in a hospital in Tokyo.
0.5;He offered to pay Kaori's\Nmedical and hospital fees
0.5;So, killing Mr. Dorakura would\Ncut off your sister's treatment...
0.5;Mr. Dorakura sure\Nwas one horrible man.
0.5;Even if the victim was as merciless\Nas a vampire, murder is murder!
0.5;I guess, unless Hamura-san\Nworked with one of the other two,
0.5;But, the only way to get to the\Nonly corridor is from the living room.
0.5;The door had a rubber seal,\Nso outside tricks would be impossible.
0.5;And, if the window was\Nused to enter and exit,
0.5;only the snow in front\Nof the window had footprints.
0.5;The weapon was the wooden\Nstake in the collection room,
0.5;so the killer was someone\Nin Dracula Manor tonight.
0.5;Wait! Why did the person\Nkill him with the stake?
0.5;That limited the suspects\Nto those inside the building.
0.5;Yet... why did they\Ndare to use that weapon?
0.5;I knew it! There's a\Nslight smell of oil paint left!
0.5;The small ventilation\Nwindows have spring stoppers...
0.5;The twig piece I found\Non the floor under the window...
0.5;And the strange imprints in the\Nsnow on the roof above the window...
0.5;There's gotta be a secret\Npassageway here somewhere!
0.5;why did the killer use the\Nprojector to light up the body?
0.5;Was it just to recreate\Nthe last scene of the movie?
0.5;That's it! I know the real reason\Nwhy the killer lit up the body!
0.5;Don't tell me there's\Na real vampire among you!
0.5;A vampire would be able to\Nfly to the study room and back!
0.5;Dear me. You appear to\Nbe exhausted, Mori-san.
0.5;Take a nice nap and leave\Nthe rest to me, old man!
0.5;I was merely joking before.\NNow, it's time to get down to business.
0.5;Are you suggesting you've\Ndiscovered the truth to this incident?
0.5;First, the wooden stake\Nused as the murder weapon.
0.5;I thought only Hamura-san\Ncould have taken the stake,
0.5;but actually, anyone could\Nhave stolen it from outside!
0.5;There wasn't a single footstep\Nin the snow outside, you know.
0.5;There were no footprints because\Nthe killer walked through the air.
0.5;Were you aware that the window\Nby the entrance hall is as high up
0.5;as the roof above\Nthe collection room window?
0.5;The killer used that fact to\Nmake a bridge...
0.5;Walking across it, the killer could\Nget to the collection room window
0.5;As proof, there are ladder\Nmarks on the snow on the roof.
0.5;They could easily be\Nopened with a simple little trick.
0.5;between the ventilation\Nwindow's stopper and the glass.
0.5;This way, the stopper\Nwill look like it's set,
0.5;but the window can\Nstill be opened freely.
0.5;Afterward, simply closing the\Nwindow would make the stopper lock.
0.5;But, Mori-san! The stake was\Ntwo meters from that window!
0.5;You used one this afternoon,\NTadokoro-san.
0.5;There are attachments\Nfor those for picking fruit.
0.5;The killer attached one and stuck\Nit through the ventilation window
0.5;Using this method, anyone\Ncould have obtained the stake.
0.5;But, Mori-san, how did the\Nperson go to the study and back?
0.5;What are you talking about?\NThat's absolute nonsense.
0.5;Isn't it much more logical than\Nhaving the killer fly through the air?
0.5;You were in the living room, too.\NYou know no one used the corridor.
0.5;The stake was still in the collection\Nroom when I went to the study!
0.5;Ran, what you two saw was\Nan elaborately-made fake.
0.5;When Tadokoro-san went to get\Nthe film, he invited you and Conan
0.5;and showed you the stake, so you\Nwould confirm it had been there.
0.5;Then, after killing Mr. Dorakura\Nwith the real stake,
0.5;which he had hidden\Nin the study in advance,
0.5;he pretended to check all\Nthe locks and stole the fake stake.
0.5;But, Mori-san. Do you have\Nproof the stake was a fake?
0.5;This turned up after I instructed\NConan to look through the storeroom.
0.5;Was the fake blood\Nadded using oil paint?
0.5;Mori-san. Even if he did use\Nthe corridor to reach the study,
0.5;It was locked from the inside,\Nso he couldn't have gone out the door.
0.5;The open window and the trampled\Nsnow were simply a red herring.
0.5;Tadokoro-san entered\Nand exited through the door.
0.5;Then how could I have\Nlocked it from the outside?!
0.5;Tadokoro-san,\NI've figured it all out, you know...
0.5;Wasn't it to recreate\Nthe last scene of the movie?!
0.5;The body was lit up to\Ncamouflage the real reason
0.5;First, pull about five\Nmeters of film from the reel.
0.5;After that, throw the film over\Nthe blackout curtain rail by the door,
0.5;This is how Tadokoro-san\Nlocked the door.
0.5;But, unfortunately for him,\Nas the film was being pulled in,
0.5;the piece of tape caught on\Nthe curtain rail and remained there.
0.5;On the piece of tape are small,\Nsquare marks... from perforations.
0.5;The square holes in\Nthe film, in other words.
0.5;I think it's about\Ntime you tell us the truth.
0.5;You already confessed you were\Nthe killer when the body was found.
0.5;The door had airtight,\Nsound-proof rubber sealing.
0.5;How could you hear\Nwhat was happening inside?
0.5;You knew that the\Nprojector was on inside.
0.5;Or, shall we see if the projector is\Naudible behind the closed door?
0.5;But why would you kill Dorakura-san?!\NWhat about your sister?!
0.5;My sister... Kaori... has\Nbeen dead for a year now...
0.5;Dorakura never gave\NKaori real medical treatment.
0.5;He paid off her doctor so she\Nwould get neither better nor worse.
0.5;But, then her condition suddenly\Ntook a turn for the worse, and she...
0.5;I only found out about\Nthis one month ago.
0.5;Dorakura kept my sister's\Ndeath secret the entire time!
0.5;I believed his lie about sending her\Nto a better hospital in America...
0.5;Kaori's nurse couldn't bear it\Nanymore and secretly came to tell me.
0.5;She said Kaori deliriously cried\Nmy name over and over as she died...
0.5;If she had had real treatment,\Nthat never would've happened!
0.5;They say a vampire's bite can turn\Na normal person into a vampire.
0.5;Unknowingly, Tadokoro-san might\Nhave become a vampire himself.
0.5;Yeah. It belongs to Furano Kenzo,\Nan engineering professor.
0.5;Apparently, he conducts strange\Nexperiments every night and--
0.5;Now we just need\Na wolfman and we're all set.
0.5;When he was in the dressing room,\Nthe flower on his chest was--
0.5;If Okano Rika-san is the killer,\Nwho will she go after next?!
0.5;This is bad!\NWho is she trying to kill?!
0.5;Who is it?!\NI'm not gonna make it in time!

0.5;You just casually acknowledged that \NShinichi-kun is your boyfriend, madam.
0.5;This room seems to be \Ndirectly beneath that arrow.

0.5;"""Now you can use the \Nbathroom during the night!"""
0.5;She must've meant to turn on this \Nlight before going to bed, so...

0.5;Which means if we place something \Nin the other rectangular marks...
0.5;Not on the floor, but this \Nsailboat on the shelf fell over.
0.5;Then the next one must \Nbe in the room next door.
0.5;But the only thing it's \Npointing towards is the bath.
0.5;There's a note in front \Nof the arrow on the sink.
0.5;Don't we need to find Maria-chan \Nas soon as possible?
0.5;Kudo Shinichi had a twin brother, \Nand it was his brother who died.

0.5;If you've figured out the \Nanswer, tell me, you traitor.
0.5;You guys aren't taking \Ncare of the drinking bird.

0.5;No. It's the door the arrow in \Nthe bathroom was pointing to.
0.5;Maria-chan mentioned that her grandpa \Nwas a really good hobbyist carpenter.
0.5;He could make anything, like \Nshelves and desks and chairs.
0.5;Then maybe her grandfather \Nmade this door, too.
0.5;Yeah, but her grandpa passed \Naway before her grandma.
0.5;Does it make any noise when \Nyou push or pull on the knob?
0.5;It won't budge an inch \Nwhether you push or pull.
0.5;The air pressure is keeping \Nthe door shut from the inside.
0.5;Normally carpenters build a \Ngap so that doesn't happen,

0.5;there's probably enough space \Nfor an adult to open it.

0.5;Someone killed her husband while \Nher house was being robbed.
0.5;Why did the robber drag\Nyou inside the house?
0.5;If they'd just left you alone, you \Nwould've thought no one was home.
0.5;Was the robber really in \Nthis house for that long?
0.5;When you were put to sleep the \Nsecond time, what was she doing?
0.5;I'm asking if you ever saw the \Nrobber and her at the same time.
0.5;They came up behind me and put a towel \Nover my face so I couldn't see anything.
0.5;You think the woman and the \Nrobber are the same person.
0.5;She used me to create \Nan alibi for the murder.
0.5;And Haibara, who was \Ndragged inside the house.
0.5;Maybe it wasn't a coincidence, \Nbut all part of a plan.
0.5;Are you saying she used Chiro so \NI would corroborate her alibi?
0.5;No one would suspect her if she traveled to\Nand from Hokkaido while you were asleep.
0.5;A direct flight to the New Chitose \NAirport only takes an hour and a half.
0.5;How long does it take to get \Nfrom here to the airport?
0.5;It takes about an hour by car, so \Nthat's two and a half hours total.
0.5;If it's two and a half hours one \Nway, then a round trip would take...
0.5;Waiting for the victim at the airport \Nwould have taken some time, too.
0.5;I'm also curious as to why your detective \Nbadge was found on Airport Street.
0.5;Someone came to the door \Nand rang the doorbell.
0.5;Yeah, I rang the doorbell six times,\Nbut she's not answering.
0.5;The doorbell and station announcements\Nwere recordings set to play by the culprit.
0.5;I think I understand what \Nyou're thinking, Edogawa-kun.
0.5;There wasn't enough time for the culprit \Nto travel to and back from Hokkaido.
0.5;But if Haibara-san awoke inside a \Ndifferent house near the airport...
0.5;Yeah. If Ai-chan was being kept \Ninside of one of those homes...
0.5;The culprit wouldn't need as much time \Ntraveling to and from the airport.
0.5;She played the recording of \Nthe doorbell at the fake house
0.5;when the liquor store delivery \Nwas supposed to arrive.
0.5;I was put to sleep twice so the culprit \Ncould transport me and the turtle.
0.5;The can started rolling \Nin a different direction?
0.5;Yes. When I woke up the second \Ntime, the can didn't budge.
0.5;I found it immediately in the \Nreal estate company's list.
0.5;The fake home you purchased and \Nremodeled was poorly constructed.
0.5;She did it for the very ordinary \Nreason of divorce complications.
0.5;She's smart, strong-willed, and \Nwas often seen scolding you.
0.5;In any case, let the Detective Boys know the \Ncase has been resolved without any issue.
0.5;Haibara's running off with \Na smile on her face...
0.5;They found someone to adopt \NChiro and the tortoise, huh?
0.5;Even if the owner commits a \Ncrime, the animal is innocent.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Troublesome Emergency Patient!"""
0.5;I'll save you as many times \Nas I have to, Haibara-san!
0.5;Conan's logic is good medicine\Nfor hearts tired by modern society!
0.5;Today is the first two-hour special!\NTry your hand at the two cases!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;"""The Great Detective is Cornered!\NTwo Big Murder Cases in a Row"""
0.5;He has to socialize\Nwith all kinds of people.
0.5;What's wrong? I assume\N that was Yukiko-san?
0.5;She was complaining\Nabout her marital strife.
0.5;Dad coming home drunk,\Ndad cheating on her...
0.5;All he thinks about is mysteries.\NHe'd never be that good-for-nothing.
0.5;Besides, their fights are almost\Nannual events. No point in worrying.
0.5;You know, with Ran-kun.\NAre you getting along well?
0.5;"She gets mad every time I call her.\N""When will you finally be back?!"""
0.5;Even though we almost see too\Nmuch of each other every single day.
0.5;Why not take a break from your\Ncases and go somewhere with her?
0.5;But don't blame me when business\Nisn't going well, Great Detective.
0.5;Yes, thank you for worrying\Nabout me, Great Attorney!
0.5;These two are having\Ntheir own marital spat.
0.5;Looking for Conan?\NHe's asleep on the sofa.
0.5;Sheesh! At least take\Nyour glasses off when you sleep!
0.5;This face... I've seen\Nit somewhere, long ago...
0.5;Come to think of it, you're\Nalways wearing glasses, Conan-kun.
0.5;Even when sleeping\Nor taking a bath. Why?
0.5;I-Isn't that obvious?\NI have bad eyesight.
0.5;A-And I can't relax\Nwithout them always on!
0.5;Might this be the\NMori Detective Agency?
0.5;Your mom, Kisaki Eri-san!\NRight, mister?
0.5;Eh? No way!\NMom asked for your help?!
0.5;This means you're pretty\Nmuch back together, then!
0.5;I thought it seemed\Nstrange that she'd call me.
0.5;Kids shouldn't be\Nmeddling with adults' affairs!
0.5;What's so wrong with doing this?!\NI want Mom to come back soon!
0.5;Died? You don't think\Nhe was killed, do you?!
0.5;On that day, one week ago,\NI left him alone at home.
0.5;so I worriedly checked his\Nspecial room in the basement...
0.5;...where I found his cold\Nbody lying on the ground!
0.5;"A policeman called it\N""aconitine,"" or something."
0.5;It's found in the leaves\Nand roots of wolfsbane.
0.5;It's a powerful toxin that causes\Ndeath minutes after ingestion.
0.5;B-But where would\Nyou come across that?
0.5;Wolfsbane is used in Chinese medicines,\Nminus the poison, of course!
0.5;T-Television! A monster in Masked\NYaiba mentioned it the other day!
0.5;"He said, ""I'll kill you with this aconitine,\Nextracted from wolfsbane!"""
0.5;He must've been a thoughtful\Nmonster to explain the poison like that...
0.5;So, were you the only\None who found the body?
0.5;No. I was with my\Nhusband's three pupils.
0.5;Umm, my husband\Nand I are both magicians.
0.5;My husband, Tsukumo Motoyasu,\Nwas maybe even world-renowned.
0.5;I know him! He was on the news!\NThey said a great magician had died.
0.5;All you ever watch\Nis horseracing, mister.
0.5;Remember? We all went to\Nhis magic show a long time ago!
0.5;Speaking of which, I think there's\Na photo of us with Tsukumo-san!
0.5;It was at that show that I\Nmet your wife, Kisaki-san.
0.5;Yes. Kisaki-san has been\Nour attorney ever since then...
0.5;Say! You should ask\Nabout those three pupils!
0.5;First, is Sanada Kazumi-kun,\Nour magic troupe's ace.
0.5;Next, is Miyoshi Mako-san.\NShe's strong-minded, but greatly skilled.
0.5;There is no better female\Nmagician in Japan than her.
0.5;He hasn't been a pupil for very\Nlong and isn't as skilled as the others,
0.5;They were with me at\Na Beika Hotel dinner show,
0.5;My husband was\Nsupposed to come too,
0.5;but he said he\Ndidn't do cheap work...
0.5;But, those three were at home\Nbefore leaving for the show, right?
0.5;Wouldn't they have had\Nthe chance to poison him?
0.5;My husband died while the\Nshow was happening, little boy.
0.5;But, couldn't they have secretly\Ngiven him the poison in a capsule?
0.5;If so, my husband would've called\Nfor help after noticing the poison.
0.5;and the door unlocks\Neasily from the inside...
0.5;Nothing like that was\Nfound in his autopsy, of course.
0.5;There were no strangle marks,\Neverything in the house was locked,
0.5;and there were absolutely\Nno signs of entry or exit.
0.5;Then that means it\Ncould only be a suicide.
0.5;But I just can't imagine my\Nhusband committing suicide!
0.5;Tomorrow is our daughter,\NAyano's, birthday.
0.5;We found this on\Nhis desk in the basement.
0.5;The Ace of Spades\Nand a Jack are stuck together.
0.5;The police pulled them apart,\Nbut there was nothing written inside.
0.5;I put them back\Ntogether to show to you.
0.5;Are you sure it\Nisn't just a magic prop?
0.5;But my husband never\Nreally did card tricks,
0.5;and I've never seen\Na prop like this before!
0.5;I'm the only one going.\NYou butt out, kid!
0.5;Of course! The late Motoyasu-san\Nwas a world-renowned magician!
0.5;Now, where is the basement\Nroom where your husband died?
0.5;After all, you have\Na pigeon in your hair!
0.5;Now, it's your turn!\NAre you a new student?
0.5;No, this is Mori\NKogoro-san, a detective.
0.5;You should at least\Nuse that many pigeons!
0.5;But, what is a detective doing here?\NWasn't his death a suicide?
0.5;Then, there are those\Nstrange cards. Or so I'd surmise.
0.5;These strange cards were on the\Ndesk in the basement where he died.
0.5;Oh, the Ace of Spades and\Nthe Jack that were stuck together.
0.5;But, isn't this just a prop?\NPlus, the police said it was a suicide.
0.5;Yes, yes. There's nothing to find now,\Neven if you scoured the house.
0.5;It's all right. The real one\Nis in your jacket pocket.
0.5;It's him! The genius magician\Nwho dressed up as the Kaito Kid
0.5;on that ship during the 60th\Nanniversary party of the Suzuki zaibatsu!
0.5;It'd be wise to leave soon,\Nunless you want to tarnish your reputation.
0.5;Seems pretty indifferent to\Nthe fact his magic instructor just died...
0.5;I guess Sanada-san's\Ntaken this pretty hard...
0.5;Yes. He looked up to my\Nhusband almost as a father.
0.5;I'm the one who has business\Nhere. He just came along, miss.
0.5;Oh, in that case, want\Nto go shopping with me?
0.5;Mommy and I are just\Nabout to go buy an outfit
0.5;Sorry! Conan-kun's busy right now!\NMaybe some other time?
0.5;Come on.\NKids should play with kids.
0.5;Ayano. I'm sorry, but I can't\Ngo shopping today, either.
0.5;But you promised,\NMommy! You're a liar!
0.5;Daddy is, too! My birthday\Nis tomorrow, but he's still overseas!
0.5;Then, will you go with me?\NI'll coordinate your outfit for you!
0.5;You still haven't told her\Nher father is dead?
0.5;No. I told her he's\Ndoing a show overseas...
0.5;Huh? This isn't my pigeon.\NIt's Mako-san's.
0.5;That's strange for her\Nto mistake her pigeons...
0.5;Her teacher's death\Nmust be hard on her, too...
0.5;And magicians are supposed to\Nbe good at concealing themselves!
0.5;You're the only one who\Ndoesn't seem any different!
0.5;Well, I'm going to\Nget dinner ready now.
0.5;Our custom is that the newest\Npupil always makes the meals.
0.5;Now then, let us see the basement\Nroom where your husband died.
0.5;He would always hole up in\Nhere and research new magic tricks.
0.5;His pupils seemed\Nto use it lately, too.
0.5;Everyone, even those who set\Nout on their own or gave up...
0.5;Say, miss. Who's that guy\Nwith the black hat?
0.5;Unfortunately, he died in\Nhis youth fourteen years ago,
0.5;Well, it's the only\Nphoto without dust on it.
0.5;I wondered if someone\Nhad been taking care of it.
0.5;Oh, you're right. Was it my husband?\NHe was especially fond of him.
0.5;Oh, so this is where he\Nswallowed the poison and collapsed?
0.5;Those cards were in the pile of\Ncards on this desk. As was the glue.
0.5;Yes. He enjoyed classical music,\Nand always listened to it in here.
0.5;He had the room soundproofed\Nso he could play the music loud.
0.5;In short, nobody would be able to\Nhear shouts coming from this room?
0.5;But the door can be easily\Nunlocked from the inside
0.5;He would've gone outside to get\Nhelp if he realized he was poisoned.
0.5;Madam. Suicide is the\Nonly possibility I can think of.
0.5;His hands are by his side,\Nin a well-mannered way.
0.5;In tv and stuff, when\Nsomeone is poisoned,
0.5;don't they put their hands to\Ntheir throat or chest like this?
0.5;When you found his body,\Nyou're sure he hadn't been strangled?
0.5;we panicked and\Nhurried to call an ambulance,
0.5;but they said no one\Nhad used rope on him at all.
0.5;Say, couldn't he have\Nbeen strangled with a thin thread?
0.5;Nonsense. Even if you couldn't\Nsee it itself, it'd still leave a mark.
0.5;Say. When he died,\Nwas he wearing these rings?
0.5;Yes. His best trick involved\Nusing invisible strings on his rings
0.5;He had probably been\Npracticing it that day.
0.5;But, he only had the rings on.\NThere weren't any strings.
0.5;After all, if the strings\Ngot tangled up behind him,
0.5;See? It's hard to get up if\Nyou can't use your hands.
0.5;And using the\Ndoorknob would be hard, too.
0.5;Your husband had rings on both\Nhands tied with string or something!
0.5;Evidence of this would\Nremain on the body, though!
0.5;But, by cutting that string\Nbefore the police arrived,
0.5;it would look like he had\Nordinary ring marks on his fingers!
0.5;Your husband was poisoned\Nbefore you and the pupils left!
0.5;The string was cut by\Nsomeone when the body was found,
0.5;That's right!\NYour husband was murdered!
0.5;By one of the three\Nwho found his body with you!
0.5;You know, the Ace and Jack\Nthat were lying over there.
0.5;Even without thumbs, it shouldn't\Nbe too hard to press the buttons.
0.5;...when we found the body,\NI rushed upstairs to call an ambulance
0.5;so I didn't notice it right away,\Nbut this phone was buried in cards.
0.5;I get it! The killer hid the phone!\NTo keep the victim from using it!
0.5;But, wouldn't it still be easy\Nto find if you tried hard enough?
0.5;Hey, mister.\NLet me see those cards.
0.5;See this symbol here?\NIt's the same shape as the cards!
0.5;That's it! These cards are a dying\Nmessage from your husband,
0.5;to someone your husband\Nleft a message with.
0.5;so we assumed it was\Nmy daughter playing around.
0.5;"""One two six eight seven\None three two four eight nine..."""
0.5;Wait a minute!\NCould these numbers mean...
0.5;Now I get it!\NThat's how this code works!
0.5;There's a fountain pen\Nin the desk, if that's all right.
0.5;Oh, that's strange.\NMy husband always had it in here.
0.5;How long're you\Ngonna look at those numbers?
0.5;so they assumed she entered\Nthose numbers before then.
0.5;Meaning your husband didn't use\Nthe phone that day for some reason.
0.5;Say, the killer poisoned the\Nvictim before everyone left, right?
0.5;Yeah. Probably using a capsule\Nthat dissolved during the show.
0.5;Then, the victim was stuck\Nin here the entire time, right?
0.5;Oh, but I guess he couldn't!\NThere were no pens in the room.
0.5;How dumb. If the victim used the\Nphone, he would've called for help.
0.5;Yeah, huh? I doubt the\Nphone was unplugged or anything.
0.5;The killer locked your husband\Nin here after unplugging the phone!
0.5;Then, it was plugged back in\Nduring all the commotion later on!
0.5;They could all pull\Noff such a stealthy trick.
0.5;The killer also hid\Nthe phone with the cards.
0.5;And your husband,\Npoisoned and locked inside,
0.5;wanted to leave a clue\Nabout the person responsible.
0.5;But the pens were gone,\Nand the phone unplugged.
0.5;The only option left was to use\Nthe redial button to leave a message.
0.5;Even when unplugged, as long\Nas there's power, numbers are saved.
0.5;Then, as a hint pointing to this,\Nhe left the two cards on the desk.
0.5;Then my husband really\Ndid enter those numbers?
0.5;because if someone used the phone\Nlater, his number would be erased.
0.5;Plus, if the phone stood out too much,\Nthe killer might get rid of it.
0.5;It's my pen! You wanted\Nsomething to write with, right?
0.5;Oh! You realized\Nsomething interesting again!
0.5;I-It's nothing much, but look\Nat this first group of numbers.
0.5;but if you connect 1, 2, 6,\N8, 7, and 1 on the phone pad,
0.5;That's it! These number\Nsequences write out four characters!
0.5;Adding in the 1-3-5-4-8\Nand 1-3-9-7 should leave us
0.5;with the message your\Nhusband left before he died!
0.5;It could be a message\Nhe left for Mako-san,
0.5;"and we don't know what the\N""DC"" before ""MAKO"" means..."
0.5;You're really amazing to figure\Nthat out from some weird numbers!
0.5;You're really something, Dad!\NYou're so smart!
0.5;The only DCs I know are\NDC Brand and Washington DC...
0.5;You know, the D.C.\Nthat's often in sheet music!
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nhe did play the piano on occasion,
0.5;It means to go back\Nto the start and repeat.
0.5;Didn't Mako-san leave\Nwith your daughter?!
0.5;Oh, it's from your mom.\NShe must want us to hurry home.
0.5;After all, we're going\Nsomewhere really fun next, right?
0.5;likely means that Mako-san\Nintends to repeat her murder!
0.5;Guess we should ask\Nthe police to search now...
0.5;K-Kinoshita? The genius magician\Nwho died fourteen years ago?
0.5;"What do you mean by\N""after all,"" Sanada-kun?!"
0.5;I thought something was up,\Nbut I never imagined she'd kill.
0.5;Even though I was flustered\Nwhen we found the body,
0.5;I was actually going to put her\Nto sleep for a very long time,
0.5;Yes. The Kinoshita Yoshiro\Nyou were just talking about
0.5;was my brother, fourteen\Nyears older than me.
0.5;At only 20, he had received every\Naccolade a magician could obtain.
0.5;And he was my only family,\Nafter our parents died when I was young.
0.5;But then that man destroyed\Nmy brother like a bug!
0.5;Tsukumo Motoyasu\Nwas jealous of his talent!
0.5;You can't be serious!\NMy husband would never--
0.5;On that day, fourteen years ago,\Nhe fiddled with the handcuffs
0.5;Immediately after, my brother\Ndrowned in the practice water tank,
0.5;because his handcuffs\Nwouldn't come off.
0.5;The incident was swept under\Nthe rug as an accident, of course...
0.5;Yes. My last name was changed\Nwhen I was taken in by relatives,
0.5;My brother was killed\Nright on my 7th birthday.
0.5;That's why I killed him\Njust before his daughter turned 7.
0.5;I revealed my identity to him\Nafter I administered the poison,
0.5;but he still seemed calm,\Nso I threatened to kill his daughter, too.
0.5;I'm sorry! That was the\Nonly way to protect my status!
0.5;Just as I said, I planned to kill his\Ndaughter, but then I decided not to.
0.5;and he unwittingly\Nswallowed my poison capsule.
0.5;For Japan's greatest\Nmagician, that's a real laugh!
0.5;I told you. I saw you hugging\Nthe photo of your brother.
0.5;"And then he said, ""Don't tell\Nthis to anyone until the time comes."""
0.5;But you won, Mako.\NYour trick completely fooled the police.
0.5;And the dying message he left\Nwon't stand as evidence at this point.
0.5;Don't ridicule me. I have no\Nintention of taking the stage now.
0.5;I'm going to go to the police\Nand lower my own curtain on myself.
0.5;Plus, it wasn't right for me to make\NAyano-chan share my lot in life.
0.5;and were supposed to return to\Nthe detective agency for a late dinner.
0.5;Oh no! I forgot to\Nbuy ingredients for dinner!
0.5;It's okay! Conan-kun and I'll get\Nsomething at the convenience store!
0.5;S-Say, Ran-neechan. This isn't\Nthe way to the convenience store.
0.5;If we're lost, we should go\Nback to the detective agency first.
0.5;W-What are you talking about?\NThis is Shinichi-niichan's house!
0.5;I see. So, that's how\Nyou've tricked us all this time.
0.5;W-What are you saying?\NOf course I'm not Shinichi-niichan!
0.5;That reasoning, ability to take action,\Nand lack of musical knowledge!
0.5;You probably took a weird drug\NDr. Agasa made or something!
0.5;Quit playing dumb already!\NI have so, so much to say to you!
0.5;Don't say crazy things\Nif you don't have proof.
0.5;There! I've never seen\Nsuch a close look-alike before!
0.5;Why are you in front of\Nour home so late at night?
0.5;S-Shinichi-kun's mother...\NWhen did you return from L.A.?
0.5;Oh no! If Mom blurts\Nout too much now...
0.5;Perfect timing.\NLet's have your birth mother...
0.5;It's you, Conan-chan!\NIt's good to see you again!
0.5;He's my grandfather's brother's\Ndaughter's cousin's uncle's grandson!
0.5;But, he says he's\Na relative of Dr. Agasa.
0.5;Yes! He and I are\Nvery distant relatives!
0.5;But doesn't he look too much\Nlike Shinichi when he was little?
0.5;You think? Conan-kun\Nseems much nicer to me...
0.5;Your mom's name is\NFumiyo-san, right?
0.5;It's too odd for a grade-schooler\Nto be so good at figuring things out!
0.5;H-He must've picked up\Nsome of Shinichi's qualities!
0.5;Ran-chan. Think about it.\NWould Shinichi do something like this?
0.5;Sorry, Conan-kun! I guess\NI had the wrong idea, again!
0.5;I'll make you a yummy\NSalisbury steak as an apology!
0.5;My vacation starts tomorrow,\Nand we haven't talked in so long!
0.5;Don't tell me your fight with\NDad this afternoon is the reason why.
0.5;Oh, that's some way to talk\Nto the person who saved your life.
0.5;who knows what her\Nkarate would've done to you!
0.5;Anyways, I hope you told\NDad you were coming here.
0.5;But whenever I'm with mini-you,\NI feel young again, too!
0.5;Okay! Let's have\Ndin-din with Mommy!
0.5;I also came back to Japan to\Ntake care of something out here.
0.5;I'd rush here from\Nthe other side of the world
0.5;Oh? Where are Yusaku-san\Nand Shinichi-kun?
0.5;Oh, those two are busy.\NBut don't worry! I brought him instead!
0.5;Oh! You and your husband\Nmust be getting along well!
0.5;So, what is it you\Nwant us to look into?
0.5;This is Yukiko-san! She used to\Nvisit all the time when she was little!
0.5;Uncle Yoshifusa says he's a\Nfriend he brought back from Brazil...
0.5;Tell me. How does\NUncle Yoshifusa seem to you?
0.5;but he went to Brazil\Nbefore I entered grade school, so...
0.5;Yes. He returned\Nfrom Brazil three days ago,
0.5;Why not show him to your dad?\NHe's your dad's little brother, right?
0.5;My father, Yoshichika,\Ndied last month of cancer...
0.5;Yes. My mother passed\Naway fifteen years ago,
0.5;and all of Uncle Yoshifusa's\Nfriends died early on...
0.5;So, we're the only two who've\Nmet him on numerous occasions.
0.5;But, why are you\Nso suspicious of him?
0.5;He owned all the land in this area,\Nand his inheritance is worth a lot.
0.5;and that anyone who's absent when\Nit's read doesn't get a single yen.
0.5;Tomorrow night at 10:00,\Nwhen his mourning ends.
0.5;Depending on the contents of\Nthe will, we may get nothing.
0.5;Anyways, we gotta do something\Nbefore tomorrow night.
0.5;It seems Uncle Yoshifusa took\Nthem all when he went to Brazil.
0.5;Oh, that's him!\NThe one in the middle!
0.5;But, he's too young\Nin it to be of any use.
0.5;This is from the city\Nbaseball tournament!
0.5;Do you remember?\NA runner's shoe spike injured his leg.
0.5;That's right. He had to get\Nlots of stitches at the hospital.
0.5;A runner spiked my\Nleg hard on first base
0.5;My brother was right!\NThere are no decent people here!
0.5;You'd hire one too,\Nif you got a letter like this!
0.5;"If you value your life,\Ndon't come back."""
0.5;One month ago. It was\Nsent to my house in Brazil.
0.5;It goes without saying that\Nthe sender's name was missing.
0.5;I didn't care about my brother's\Ninheritance, but I did want to see
0.5;Hey, mister!\NTeach me some kanji letters!
0.5;Yes. But I can't remember\Nif our uncle was left-handed or not.
0.5;But, he did have the scar on his leg,\Nso I think he is Uncle Yoshifusa.
0.5;and relied on an old scar of\Nhis own he just happened to have.
0.5;Take a look at the photo of\NUncle Yoshifusa we found in the shed.
0.5;A New Year's card that Uncle\NYoshifusa sent when he was in Brazil!
0.5;See? The handwriting matches\Nexactly with what he wrote just now!
0.5;Hold on. Don't tell me you had\Nhim write this so you could check?
0.5;Just what I'd expect\Nfrom the son of Kudo Yusaku,
0.5;We all looked for her,\Nbut couldn't find her.
0.5;The next morning, just when\Nwe were about to contact the police,
0.5;We were going to destroy\Nthe well because it was dangerous,
0.5;but Father asked to keep it until he\Ndied too, so he'd never forget her.
0.5;So, that's why there's\Na fence around the well.
0.5;I went and put it there myself,\Nso nobody else'd fall in.
0.5;But, the real trouble was\Nduring the funeral before then.
0.5;Our mom's brother\Nsuddenly caused a scene!
0.5;Claimed one of us\Nknocked her down there!
0.5;The cause was that\Ncamellia plant our uncle grew
0.5;She wanted to show it to us.\NShe loved those flowers.
0.5;They hardly bloomed\Nduring the winter of that year,
0.5;and she had been\Nwaiting for them eagerly.
0.5;A camellia flower\Nwas found in her hand, so...
0.5;But, in the end, her brother\Ndidn't seem to accept it.
0.5;He was rather old back then,\Nso perhaps he's passed away?
0.5;Hey, now! If he's still alive,\Nwon't he get the inheritance, too?!
0.5;Don't worry! Legally, he shouldn't\Nhave any inheritance rights to it!
0.5;He could still receive some inheritance,\Nif it's in my husband's will.
0.5;Then, what, he might show\Nup before 10:00 tomorrow night,
0.5;That's right. If he's alive,\Nhe'll be absolutely sure to come.
0.5;Plus, he seems to have a\N15-year old grudge with you all.
0.5;Though, it has nothing\Nto do with me, of course,
0.5;as I wasn't a part\Nof this family when she died.
0.5;Oh, yes! I'm off to a friend's\Nafter-wedding party now.
0.5;A strange person watching\Nus from behind that wood gate!
0.5;Sure you weren't\Njust seeing things, kid?
0.5;That's strange. I'm pretty\Nsure someone was here...
0.5;I don't like this. Don't tell me\Nthis person is actually her brother?!
0.5;I'm sorry to bother you by staying here\Nand having you make such a nice meal!
0.5;It's no problem! Nabe dishes\Nare more fun with lots of people!
0.5;Whatever. You even\Npacked a change of clothes.
0.5;I bet you were planning\Nto stay from the start...
0.5;What was that? Did you\Nsay something, Conan-chan?
0.5;That reminds me, we were\Nout of firewood for the bath.
0.5;Yes. So I thought we'd go\Nwithout using the bath tonight.
0.5;I bought firewood for the bath\Nthis morning and put it by the shed.
0.5;She sure is carefree in\Nthe middle of Dad's mourning.
0.5;Oh! A nabe for dinner tonight!\NNow I can rest easy!
0.5;I won't have to ask Carlos\Nto taste-test my food for poison!
0.5;I'm sure that letter\Nwas a prank or something!
0.5;Oh, what's wrong\Nwith that? It has elegance.
0.5;Say, Shin-chan. Want to bathe\Ntogether like in the old days?
0.5;Hey. Could you tell\NUncle the bath is ready?
0.5;Do you think he and that Carlos\Nperson will fit in this small bath?
0.5;Uncle has taken a bath\Nevery day since he's come here,
0.5;Eh? He would take a bath all alone,\Nleaving his bodyguard behind?
0.5;Now I see. Carlos watches\Neveryone while he's in the bath...
0.5;I'm still at the party. I don't think\NI'll be back until after 11:00.
0.5;I'm sorry to ask, but could\Nyou keep the bath warm until then?
0.5;Honestly! You can take baths\Nwith Ran-chan, but not with me?!
0.5;D-Don't tell me she jumped\Ninto the well to commit suicide?!
0.5;No! There's a stab mark in\Nher chest! This is how she died!
0.5;Say. Machiko-san's last phone\Ncall was at around 9:00, right?
0.5;Yes. From the banquet hall\Nof the hotel near the station.
0.5;Did anyone leave the\Nroom while I was in the bath?
0.5;Then, it couldn't\Nhave been someone here.
0.5;It would take at least one hour by\Ncar from the hotel to this house.
0.5;she returned, and someone killed\Nher and threw her down the well.
0.5;Though, it's a different\Nstory if you suspect me,
0.5;even though I met her\Nfor the first time today.
0.5;Then... Then the person\NI just saw r-really was...
0.5;The deceased is\NYabuuchi Machiko-san, age 39.
0.5;the head of this house\Nwho died last month?
0.5;We haven't found\Nthe murder weapon yet,
0.5;but it appears she died of\Nblood loss from the stab to the chest.
0.5;It seemed odd that the well bucket\Nwas up, so when we pulled it up...
0.5;No, no! I just got\Nchills when I imagined it...
0.5;Umm, this would mean that\Nthe killer was one of you eight
0.5;and she called from\Nthere at around 9:00!
0.5;Even if she left by\Ncar right after calling,
0.5;she wouldn't be\Nback until after 10:00.
0.5;between 10:00 and the\Ntime the body was found,
0.5;No! I only met the\Nlate Machiko-san today!
0.5;It's the truth!\NYukiko's been living abroad.
0.5;I just happened\Nto ask her here today.
0.5;"""Yukiko""? Oh, wait a minute!\NDon't tell me you're..."
0.5;"I used to watch you every week on\N""Dangerous Policewoman Story!"""
0.5;You actually inspired me\Nto join the police!
0.5;After all, you're skilled\Nat using guns and knives.
0.5;Say. Was it really\NMachiko-san who called?
0.5;She responded to the conversation,\Nand I could hear the party, too.
0.5;There's someone\Nelse who's suspicious!
0.5;A strange person covering his face\Nwith sunglasses, a hat, and a scarf.
0.5;I bet it's the brother of our mom,\Nwho died fifteen years ago.
0.5;She tried to pick a flower there\Nand accidentally fell into the well.
0.5;But he's convinced one\Nof us pushed her down there.
0.5;But just like me, Machiko-san wasn't\Npart of the family fifteen years ago!
0.5;It was dark back here.\NMaybe he mistook her for someone else?
0.5;Umm, it's still not certain if\Nhe was the man with sunglasses...
0.5;This was in this\Nlady's breast pocket.
0.5;You're with the homicide\Ndepartment, aren't you?
0.5;A-Actually, this is my\Nfirst real investigation...
0.5;There's a cold going\Naround the department,
0.5;so I was the only\None they could send...
0.5;A-Anyways, to find out the\Nprecise time the victim returned home,
0.5;I'll need to check with\Nthe taxi she took from the hotel.
0.5;so perhaps she left the\Ncar there and took a taxi home?
0.5;We found a car in the\Nwoods right behind the house.
0.5;T-This is our car!\NBut why is it in the woods?
0.5;Maybe the killer planned to\Nuse it, but changed his mind?
0.5;Your mother probably just ran\Nout of gas or had engine trouble!
0.5;So she walked to the house,\Nwhere that man was waiting to stab her!
0.5;That's strange. The engine works\Njust fine, and the key was still in.
0.5;And this empty cassette\Ncase seems curious.
0.5;There's only a cell phone\Nin the glove compartment.
0.5;In any case, you'll all sleep\Ntonight while we keep watch.
0.5;Plus, that man\Ncould still be out there.
0.5;Geez. We all gotta sleep in\Nthe same room as some cops?
0.5;I'll get accused of being the killer\Nif we leave it to that lamebrain cop!
0.5;There's that man in the sunglasses,\Nthe car left in the woods,
0.5;Even though it was hidden in the well,\Nit almost asked to be found.
0.5;Yeah. There are too many\Nmysteries scattered about.
0.5;Come on. Let's get back\Nto our room and sleep.
0.5;Please see if it matches\Nwith the victim's stab wound.
0.5;The knife was wrapped\Nin it for some reason.
0.5;No, forget it!\NAuthorized personnel only!
0.5;and we haven't\Nfinished checking the house.
0.5;The reading should\Nbe moved to a later date...
0.5;The greedier you are,\Nthe more noise you make.
0.5;You got that?!\NYou're just an impostor, anyway!
0.5;Is pain the only way\Nto get through to you?
0.5;How about this? We police\Nwill also attend the reading. Okay?
0.5;Does that mean Carlos\Nis even more skilled than him?
0.5;But, if he's so good at self-defense,\Nwhy would he hire a bodyguard?
0.5;Good question. Maybe\Nhe's just being extra cautious.
0.5;The reading of Yabuuchi Yoshichika's\Nlast will will now take place.
0.5;Yoshichika-san recorded a\Ntape that accompanies his written will.
0.5;So, it was set to\Nfire at a specified time...
0.5;It must've been that person\Nwho ran from the gate last night!
0.5;Assuming he really is the brother\Nof our mom who died fifteen years ago...
0.5;...and that he held a grudge\Nagainst our Yabuuchi family...
0.5;He used the fact we would gather\Nin here for the reading of the will
0.5;and set up the\Nbow gun and arrow there.
0.5;Does that mean\Nanyone would've done, then?
0.5;See? Look at the room on the\Nother side of the wall it went through.
0.5;See all the arrow\Nholes in the floor mat?
0.5;It's proof that the killer had\Ndone some test shots beforehand.
0.5;In order to hit the\Nperson sitting in that spot.
0.5;that the will would be\Nread in that room, right?
0.5;But, kid, there'd be no\Nway to tell who'd sit where.
0.5;In other words, that means the\Nperson who set up the arrow...
0.5;So, there's still another cretin out\Nto take my life. Heaven help me.
0.5;What if Uncle was the\None who set up the arrow?
0.5;Then, is all of this the doing of\Nthat strange man with the sunglasses?
0.5;But shouldn't we\Nstop that tape recorder?
0.5;Hey! Did all of our\Ndad's will get erased?!
0.5;I accidentally put it on\NSide B instead of Side A.
0.5;In any case, I don't think\Nwe'll be able to solve this case
0.5;Yeah. But I have a good\Nidea who set up the arrow.
0.5;No! There are still too many mysteries!\NI can't say anything rashly!
0.5;Fine, then! I'll figure it out\Non my own! Who needs you?!
0.5;We found a suspicious\Ncassette tape by the bath stove!
0.5;Listen, everyone! Please stay\Nin this room until I return!
0.5;H-Huh? Where's\NYukiko-san and that boy?
0.5;Hold on, hold on! Please\Ndon't wander around on your own!
0.5;Hiromi got the bath ready, but she\Ndidn't say anything about a tape.
0.5;Oh, and we just received word\Nfrom the examiners. It's strange...
0.5;Only the victim's fingerprints and\Nblood were on the murder weapon,
0.5;but oddly enough, it appears\Nshe had held it as you would a sword.
0.5;If she had grabbed the\Nhandle after being stabbed,
0.5;If it was placed in her hands\Nto make it look like a suicide,
0.5;it would've made sense\Nto have it upside down, too!
0.5;Oh, and I contacted the hotel\Nthe victim had supposedly been at.
0.5;The late Machiko-san said\Nshe'd be home after 11:00,
0.5;This door will take you straight\Nfrom the bath to the stove.
0.5;And this stove is right next to the well,\Nwhere the body was hidden!
0.5;You said that sunglasses person\Nwas watching from this gate, right?
0.5;Yeah. Hiromi-san\Nsaw him run from there, too.
0.5;Okay! Let's go listen to\Nthat tapey-wapey, Conan-chan!
0.5;This tape was really\Nright next to the stove?
0.5;Just as I thought! This makes all\Nof Machiko-san's strange actions fit!
0.5;I'm going to explain using\Nyour voice, so go along with it...
0.5;Don't give me that. You wouldn't\Ntell me anything earlier.
0.5;Because I know something\Nyou don't, Shin-chan!
0.5;Well, let's hear the tape with\Nthe will for now. What do you say?
0.5;Or so I'd like to say, but the will\Ncan wait until after my explanation.
0.5;After I've revealed who was\Nresponsible for the two incidents here.
0.5;Hey, now. Wasn't the guy\Nwith the sunglasses behind that?
0.5;Until I heard a certain\Nsomeone say a certain something.
0.5;Why don't we give it a listen?\NWe do have it...
0.5;T-The cabinet! An arrow\Ncame out of that cabinet!
0.5;As you all know, the\Narrow fired from the cabinet
0.5;shot through the wall,\Nand left our field of vision.
0.5;Yet, a certain person accurately\Nidentified it as an arrow,
0.5;before we even opened the cabinet\Nand found a bow gun inside.
0.5;It was because you set\Nup that bow gun, Keiko-san!
0.5;B-But that's not enough\Nto prove Keiko did it...
0.5;It's true! I set it up! The day\NUncle Yoshifusa came back!
0.5;I got us in debt.\NI kept it a secret from you.
0.5;It was a huge amount,\Nwith even bigger interest.
0.5;I thought if I could get\Nmy portion of the inheritance,
0.5;But, when I heard your uncle\Ncame back from Brazil, I just snapped.
0.5;It doesn't matter,\Nsince you killed Mother anyway.
0.5;The person who murdered\NMachiko-san and hid her in the well...
0.5;The one who murdered Machiko-san\Nand hid her body in the well...
0.5;Wait! Don't tell us it was\Nthe guy with the sunglasses!
0.5;He's probably our mom's\Nbrother, who blames us
0.5;for her death when she fell\Ninto the well fifteen years ago!
0.5;He has a motive, but could you\Nsave this for until after he's caught?!
0.5;No. He's likely a\Ndetective someone hired
0.5;to determine if Mr. Yoshifusa\Nreally is who he claims to be.
0.5;Yes. Machiko-san's\Nkiller is in this very room!
0.5;Even if she left right after calling,\Nshe'd arrive here after 10:00.
0.5;We were all in the same room then,\Nso we couldn't have done it!
0.5;Just after 8:00, Machiko-san\Nmade her first call from the party,
0.5;and played back a tape recording\Nof the party on the car stereo
0.5;She was the one who was killed.\NWhy would she create an alibi?
0.5;Machiko-san planned to use\Nthat alibi trick and kill someone.
0.5;But she wound up being\Nkilled by that person instead.
0.5;Ironically, her trick wound up\Nhelping the alibi of her killer instead.
0.5;She put it on beforehand to keep\Nher victim's blood off her clothes.
0.5;She had it in her pocket so she could\Ndrop it at the murder scene later
0.5;to make it look connected\Nto the incident fifteen years ago.
0.5;she either dropped it on her way\Nto her target who was in the bath,
0.5;or it fell from her pocket while her\Nbody was being carried to the well.
0.5;In either case, she likely planned\Nto burn the tape in the stove.
0.5;The murder probably\Nhappened in the bathroom.
0.5;That way, if any blood went flying,\Nit could be cleaned away.
0.5;So, who is this person who\Nkilled her first in the bathroom?!
0.5;Machiko-san's target was someone\Nfond of taking a bath every day,
0.5;and the only person here whose\Nturn to use it was set in stone.
0.5;As I recall, Brazilian jujutsu\Nhas a certain technique...
0.5;in which you twist the arm\Nof a knife-wielding attacker
0.5;When Machiko-san attacked,\Nyou used that move without thinking!
0.5;Increasing her share of the\Ninheritance was probably her motive.
0.5;B-But that would be self-defense.\NWhy would he keep quiet about it?
0.5;Because he had been\Nsent two threatening letters.
0.5;So, there's still another\Ncretin out to take my life.
0.5;In short, Machiko-san\Nhad also sent a threat letter.
0.5;to serve as an example to\Nthe other intimidator.
0.5;In any case, it was\Nself-defense, plain and simple.
0.5;The tape with the will on it.\NOne listen will shed light on everything.
0.5;I divide my inheritance between\Nthe following six people:
0.5;my wife Machiko, my daughter\NHiromi, her husband Hidekazu,
0.5;C-Carlos?! W-What is\Nhis name doing on here?!
0.5;I hereby divide my inheritance\Nevenly among those six people.
0.5;That's strange! Why isn't\Nyour name on the list, Uncle?!
0.5;After all, that old man is a\Nbodyguard who came here from Brazil
0.5;The son born of the real\NYoshifusa-san and a Brazilian woman.
0.5;But, Detective!\NWhere did you find that out?!
0.5;Because Mr. Yoshifusa\Nhad the old man write for him.
0.5;Mr. Yoshifusa and the old man\Nowned a farm in Brazil together.
0.5;But when a tornado hit ten years ago,\Nthe old man hurt his right leg
0.5;because Mr. Yoshichika felt sorry\Nfor his brother who lost his farm
0.5;in this pile of letters left in\Na hidden panel in the storeroom.
0.5;But why did you\Npretend to be our uncle?
0.5;If that was his intent,\Nhe wouldn't have taken on the role
0.5;If people learned\NCarlos was Mr. Yoshifusa's son,
0.5;he would've been\Ntargeted by the intimidators.
0.5;That's why the old man\Ntook on the role of Mr. Yoshifusa.
0.5;To have the intimidators'\Nattacks focused on him instead.
0.5;This is evidenced by the fact\Nthat when the old man would bathe,
0.5;he would leave Carlos\Nin the other room.
0.5;Because making it seem like\Nhe was keeping watch over everyone
0.5;The old man planned to\Ncatch the intimidator,
0.5;he would've been taken\Naway by the police for questioning.
0.5;But he couldn't leave Carlos alone\Nwith one other intimidator around.
0.5;He made the body easy to find to\Nsee if the police detective who came
0.5;But what came was\Nan unreliable rookie detective.
0.5;the old man decided to remain\Nsilent until the will was read.
0.5;Hickson Tanaka-san, 2nd-generation\NJapanese-Brazilian?!
0.5;I can introduce you to a great,\Nhardhearted inspector I know.
0.5;Yes, that would be best.\NI think I can trust you!
0.5;and Tanaka-san and Keiko-san were\Ntaken to the Gunma Police Dept.
0.5;Carlos, who knew very little Japanese,\Nwatched sadly as the car left,
0.5;but Dad told him in Portuguese\Nthat he would be back very soon,
0.5;Tanaka-san hadn't told\Nhim about the inheritance
0.5;or that this was his\Nfather's family's home.
0.5;No, I knew he was a\Nfake before reading the letters.
0.5;A left-handed first baseman\Nwould stretch out from the left leg.
0.5;It seemed strange, so I scoured\Nthe storeroom and found the letters.
0.5;It seems you still lack in the\Nobservation department, Shinichi-kun!
0.5;Look at you trying to act cool,\Nafter chasing after me.
0.5;"""I'm just a mere mystery writer.""\NYou gotta be kidding me!"
0.5;Are you trying to be\NAkechi Kogoro or something?
0.5;What're you doing, Shinichi?\NYou'll get left behind!
0.5;In any event, these incidents\Nand this marital spat are over now.
0.5;Oh, yes. I'd watch out\Nfor Ran-chan if I were you.
0.5;Something bugs me\Nabout that last smile of hers...
0.5;Yes. Underestimate women\Nand you'll be in a world of hurt.
0.5;If you're going on an overnight\Ntrip somewhere, at least tell us first!
0.5;I kept calling Shinichi's\Nhouse but no one was there!
0.5;"On the next Conan:\N""The Farewell Wine Murder Case"""
0.5;"today ""Detective Conan"" is entering \Nits 22nd year of broadcasting."
0.5;Last year, you and Ebizo-san wished \Nthem a Happy New Year yourselves!
0.5;We hope you'll continue \Nsupporting Detective Conan...
0.5;Even heaven is watching the \Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;when I went home to take \Na nap for a couple hours.
0.5;But... I don't want to get\Nthe police involved.
0.5;Why don't you want to get the police \Ninvolved when you know who did it?
0.5;for whom you worked as a legal \Nadvisor, Karahashi Gotaro.
0.5;I believe he passed away three \Ndays ago due to an illness.
0.5;the contents of the will were \Nunfavorable for the thief?
0.5;The chairman summoned me to the \Nhospital where he was staying.
0.5;I'd feel bad for him if he \Ncouldn't buy a copy of the game.
0.5;There were still plenty \Nof copies on the shelves.
0.5;This morning, we met up to buy \Ncopies of a new game today.
0.5;he planned to give 50% of his fortune \Nto his eldest son Karahashi Kozo,
0.5;between his eldest daughter \NMitsuyo and second son Eisuke.
0.5;Well, actually, the chairman had a secretary \Nwho worked for him for fifty years.
0.5;He was going to give his \Nentire fortune to her.
0.5;and is being treated at a\Nhospital in her hometown.
0.5;His spare glasses are with the \Nprofessor for maintenance.
0.5;Since he's not answering his \Nphone, I don't have a choice.
0.5;Let's try looking for him \Nourselves for a little bit.
0.5;And Conan might've just gone \Nto get lunch by himself.
0.5;This is where Conan-kun suddenly \Ntold us to go on ahead.
0.5;and the other side of the \Nstreet, little by little.
0.5;Considering the circumstances and \Nthe fact that we're short on time,
0.5;You make it seem like one \Nof us stole the will.
0.5;Well, actually, I was going \Nto figure that out now...
0.5;Wh-Why are you looking \Nat me like that, Eisuke?!
0.5;Mitsuyo, you were furious \Nover the original will.
0.5;Anyway, I'd like to hear \Nabout the details later,
0.5;but there is one thing \NI'd like to make clear.
0.5;We'll start with the eldest \Nson, Kozo-san, was it?
0.5;Would you be able to tell me \Nwhere you were this morning?
0.5;She was complaining that she didn't \Nlike the program for the funeral.
0.5;I called my brother since I couldn't stand \Nit, but she butted in while on hold.
0.5;Just because you're the oldest, \Nyou took control of everything.
0.5;With your program, I doubt Papa \Nwill be able to rest in peace.
0.5;I only use my cell phone \Nwhile I'm out of the house.
0.5;If there are nails, I could \Nhook the rope onto one and...
0.5;Naturally I'll be confirming \Ntheir stories later,
0.5;You'd be able to pay them once \Nyou got your inheritance.
0.5;Based on the way the sound \Nechoed, I must be inside.
0.5;He was called early this morning \Nby a resident of the building.
0.5;Maybe there's a really \Ngood restaurant inside.
0.5;Judging by the size, I must \Nreally be inside a coffin.
0.5;Someone placed a board over stacks of \Ncardboard, creating a false bottom.
0.5;We followed the alleyway you entered \Nto the rear entrance of a building.
0.5;There was a burglary happening \Ninside that building, and...
0.5;That was awful. I was in the \Ndark for thirty whole minutes.
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut cases are even more so!
0.5;Today is the\Nlemon pie conclusion!
0.5;Fragrant memories\Nand tender first love!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;rumored to have\Nbeen Shinichi's first love.
0.5;She fell asleep, so the rest of us\Nwent to the Karaoke Room in town.
0.5;That's when one of her friends\Nnoticed the lodge was on fire!
0.5;Uchida Asami\Nwas asleep in the lodge!
0.5;As I was saying, she was sleep-mumbling\Nwhen they brought her here.
0.5;How should I know?\NThat's just what I heard.
0.5;I can get you something from\Nthe vending machine downstairs!
0.5;Yeah! He's perfectly okay!\NNot a scratch on him!
0.5;I bet he's with your dad,\Nloitering around the scene of the fire.
0.5;Was it really an accident? Did they\Njust forget to put out the candles?
0.5;If so, then why was she asleep\Non the sofa when we left
0.5;Something seems off about\Nthe furniture before and after the fire!
0.5;Could it be?! Did someone\Ncome back here to set the fire?!
0.5;Anyone could've easily entered\Nvia a window unlocked in advance!
0.5;By car, it'd take five minutes to get here.\NRunning, it'd take fifteen.
0.5;so only Noguchi-san could've\Ngone there, set the fire, and returned,
0.5;The car was parked in\Nfront of the karaoke place,
0.5;and everyone left thirty minutes\Nbefore to use the station bathrooms
0.5;and buy cigarettes and such\Nfrom the convenience store next door.
0.5;So someone would've\Nnoticed if the car was missing.
0.5;No, it was parked in front of\Nthe lodge when we rushed here.
0.5;None of the people in the\Nkaraoke booth could've done it!
0.5;It'd be a different story if there\Nwas a timer device of some sort,
0.5;but if there had been one,\Nthe firemen would've found it long ago.
0.5;Which leaves what the old guy\Nsaid... It was Asami-san who...
0.5;Oh, yeah. I hear today's the\Nbirthday of that girl who was asleep.
0.5;The presents and the cake all\Nburned up, but this survived the fire!
0.5;Come to think of it, that person\Ndid say something strange then!
0.5;Say, Mister. Was the\Ncake really on a chair?
0.5;But doesn't it\Nseem strange to you, Ran?
0.5;I heard she was in the tennis club\Nuntil her 2nd year of middle school.
0.5;Huh? But wasn't she the soccer\Nclub manager in her 3rd year?
0.5;Yeah! Apparently she completely\Nchanged after that summer break!
0.5;She probably wanted to\Nfocus on her studying.
0.5;The 2nd semester of the 3rd\Nyear is when people quit their clubs!
0.5;I bet she switched 'cause there\Nwere no hot guys in the tennis club.
0.5;Well, anyways,\Nshe must've had her reasons.
0.5;It's probably\Nnone of our business to pry.
0.5;Eh? Customers who\Ncame in at around 3:00?
0.5;Let me think. Just some youngsters\Ndoing karaoke next door, I guess.
0.5;They bought cigarettes,\Ntomato juice, and other stuff.
0.5;Sawai-san, Hayasaka-san,\Nand Noguchi-san!
0.5;Yeesh! That buzz-cut guy\Npuked in front of the store!
0.5;No, she wasn't in the bathroom.\NHow about you, Ran?
0.5;Just contact your dad\Nfor now! I'll go get a nurse!
0.5;Yeah, that's right, little boy!\NHow did you know that?
0.5;I told him he had it backwards,\Nbut he didn't listen.
0.5;It had sticky stuff on it, too.\NWhat a ridiculous customer.
0.5;No question about it!\NThat person set the fire!
0.5;And if my theory is right, the\Nevidence is still in their possession!
0.5;Yeah! She was in\Nbed just a minute ago!
0.5;She must've left while we were\Ngetting something to drink!
0.5;Just look around outside the\Nhospital! She might still be nearby!
0.5;Yes. If it really was\NAsami-san who set the fire.
0.5;Asami-san was not\Nthe perpetrator but the victim!
0.5;But the fire started when\Nwe were in the karaoke booth!
0.5;Or only five minutes\Nby car or motorcycle.
0.5;None of us could have\Ncome here to set the fire then.
0.5;Though it'd be different if there\Nwas some sort of timer device,
0.5;What if it was something\Nnot out of the ordinary?
0.5;What if it was something\Nthat belonged there
0.5;Yes. The perpetrator set\Nthe fire from kilometers away!
0.5;By using a certain thing at a\Ncertain location near the karaoke place!
0.5;This man asked me to have\Nthe firefighters set up the same trick
0.5;If we place it on the chair in front\Nof the fax machine, everything's set.
0.5;You're not suggesting we wait\Nuntil a candle falls to the floor?
0.5;that'd make it an accident\Ncaused by carelessness.
0.5;That fax was sent by the convenience\Nstore owner at my request.
0.5;The more complicated the trick,\Nthe more likely evidence will be left.
0.5;leave as little out of\Nthe ordinary as possible,
0.5;and make it look\Nlike an accidental fire.
0.5;B-But he leapt into\Nthe flames to rescue Asami!
0.5;Would he really rescue\Nsomeone he was trying to kill?!
0.5;What if this fire was set so\Nhe could rescue Asami-san?
0.5;He dropped sedatives into\Nher drink to make her sleep,
0.5;To keep Asami-san from burning\Nto death, he placed her on the floor,
0.5;Then, just as he planned,\Nwhile everyone was busy doing karaoke,
0.5;he sent a fax to\Nthe lodge and started the fire.
0.5;The store owner saw him sending\Nthe fax just before the fire started.
0.5;The burned remnants\Nof that fax were also found.
0.5;See? The shapes don't fit,\Nso there must've been two pages.
0.5;Only one page was sent before\Nthe fire, so it seemed strange.
0.5;H-Hold on, now! Yes, I did send\Na fax at the convenience store.
0.5;He asked me to come\Nup with a good title for his novel!
0.5;You gave the transmit slip to the\Nstore owner after you sent it, right?
0.5;The date, time, phone number,\Nand your fingerprints are on it.
0.5;Oh, that's strange.\NI'm sure I sent it to him.
0.5;See? My friend's number and this\Nlodge's number are next to each other.
0.5;Besides, I'm president of Toto\NUniversity's mystery study club!
0.5;I'd never use such\Nan unreliable trick as that!
0.5;As you know, to use the copy\Nfeature, you need to use an original.
0.5;So you copied the birthday\Nmessage Professor Takamura just sent,
0.5;The owner complained that you\Nstuck sticky paper in the machine.
0.5;But you can't blame him.\NYou sent the blank side of the copy.
0.5;Because if two faxes with the same\Nmessage were found at the scene,
0.5;That's enough! I'm sick of these\Ngroundless, made-up accusations!
0.5;If you're going to make\Nsuch claims, show some proof!
0.5;They can't easily throw away\Nanything that could put them in danger.
0.5;They worry that\Nsomeone else might pick it up.
0.5;You even brought it back\Nfrom the convenience store.
0.5;How ridiculous! I should've\Njust thrown this thing away!
0.5;Yeah. I set the fire. Using the exact\Nmethod the detective explained.
0.5;But how did you know it was me?\NAnyone could've used that trick.
0.5;Should we call her on the phone?!\NShe was asleep in the living room!
0.5;As a brave man who risked his\Nlife to rescue her from the flames.
0.5;She turned me down\Nwhen I asked her out last month.
0.5;That had never happened\Nto me before, so I couldn't stand it.
0.5;I'd planned for it to be a small fire,\Nbut it spread faster than I thought.
0.5;Why couldn't you imagine\NAsami-san possibly burning to death?!
0.5;Asami-san would've lost\Nher life in any of those cases!
0.5;why didn't you consider becoming\Nsomeone who could be loved?!
0.5;Why didn't you consider\Nimproving yourself instead?!
0.5;Alright. You can explain\Neverything to the police.
0.5;I really wanted him to\Nlike me. He was my first love.
0.5;Hmm. I didn't really\Ntake notice of him at first.
0.5;In his first year, he was a regular\Nmidfielder on the soccer team.
0.5;I thought he was an impressive\Nnewcomer. That's about it.
0.5;Everyone told me it\Nwas delicious, except for him...
0.5;Later on, everyone\Nsaid they had pretended to like it.
0.5;That hurt my feelings, so I baked\Na new one every day for three months
0.5;Before I knew it, I was\Nmanager of the soccer club
0.5;Someone else made it\Ngreat on her first try, though.
0.5;Did you know? I was mean and\Ntaught you a weird way of making it!
0.5;Sheesh. Shall I tell you what he\Nsaid after I confessed to him, then?
0.5;Pipe down!\NThis is getting good! Be quiet!
0.5;There's someone I've been\Nfond of since I was little.
0.5;She's strong-minded and obstinate,\Nyet easily moved to tears.
0.5;We saw Nagakura Isami-san\Ncollapse on the veranda from your room!
0.5;It definitely looks\Nlike Okita-san killed her.
0.5;Wait a minute!\NCould this incident be--?!
0.5;"""The Historical Drama\NActor Murder Case (Part 1)."""
0.5;So this year, I'll present my \Nmeat and potatoes to the world,
0.5;Boatloads and fistfuls, boatloads \Nand fistfuls, boatloads—
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;the trick box made by mid-19th \NCentury tinkerer Samizu Kichiemon.
0.5;left something important \Nto me inside that box.
0.5;Apparently my husband \Nstuck the instructions
0.5;I'd like you to find that paper \Nwithin the books I've given to you.
0.5;"The world's largest \Nmoonstone, ""Luna Memoria."""
0.5;It's exactly the kind of thing that \Nmoonlit magician-thief goes after.
0.5;"""The jewel is inside a trick \Nbox made by Samizu Kichiemon."""
0.5;"""If you want to see it, you'll either \Nhave to open the box yourself,"
0.5;"or find the written instructions \Nin the library."""
0.5;"""General Adviser to the Suzuki \NConglomerate, Suzuki Jirokichi."""
0.5;I've been invited by the \Ngeneral adviser as well.
0.5;he's asked me to open the \Nbox before Kid arrives.
0.5;I was told last time that the \Nvegetables weren't cooked enough.
0.5;So I came to share some of this thoroughly \Nstewed meat and potatoes I made.
0.5;Turtlenecks are just about the only thing \Nthat cover his choker-shaped voice changer.
0.5;He always comes through \Nat the critical moment.
0.5;Yeah, right. I actually made it \Neasier for Kid to sneak in...
0.5;By inviting more people for \Nhim to disguise himself as.
0.5;he won't pinch any faces, \Nand that the police
0.5;Then there's no point in \Ndisguising myself as him.
0.5;It's supposed to open when you \Npush or pull a certain part.
0.5;I wouldn't expect any less \Nfrom Samizu Kichiemon.
0.5;It shoots out needles if \Nyou're careless with it.
0.5;Then why don't we put it \Nin a vice and cut it open?
0.5;That was made by the famous \Ntinkerer Samizu Kichiemon.
0.5;The box itself is worth as much \Nas the moonstone inside it.
0.5;But I thought moonstones \Nweren't that valuable.
0.5;I see them going for about ten \Nthousand yen online all the time.
0.5;to the source in Sri Lanka \Nto buy the one in the box.
0.5;Moonstones that produce that \Noptical phenomenon are valuable.
0.5;it may truly be as valuable as \Na Samizu Kichiemon trick box.
0.5;Naturally, if he quietly \Nopens the box and attempts
0.5;to take just the jewel inside, \Nthe same thing will happen.
0.5;When the box is opened, \Nthe music box inside it
0.5;I heard a music box playing \Nin the middle of the night,
0.5;and then winding the key before \Nputting it back together.
0.5;The last time my husband opened the \Nbox was more than a decade ago.
0.5;I think it may have been a nursery \Nsong or something similar.
0.5;So, where are the written \Ninstructions for opening the box?
0.5;I saw him putting a piece \Nof paper with a diagram
0.5;of the box with arrows and \Nnumbers inside a book.
0.5;Later my husband found me searching \Nthe study for that book.
0.5;That's what he said, so I \Nassume the instructions
0.5;Why did your husband hide \Nthat jewel from you?
0.5;Perhaps he didn't want me to see him \Nso carefully keeping such a stone.
0.5;Her husband was one of \Nmy adventuring friends.
0.5;When we circled the world \Nin our man-powered plane,
0.5;he hid behind me when the media \Ncame to take photos of us.
0.5;"I swear on my title that I \Nwill come for the moonstone."""
0.5;Which means in order to \Nopen the box before Kid,
0.5;it would be faster to find the book \Ncontaining the written instructions to open it.
0.5;All the books in the study \Nwere donated to the library.
0.5;This is just like the \Nstudy at Shinichi's house.
0.5;I had my entire staff spend \Na whole day searching,
0.5;they flipped through them \Nlike you're doing now.
0.5;Normally if there's something \Nstuck between the pages,
0.5;Is it possible your husband \Nhid the paper somewhere else?
0.5;My husband died last month in \Nan unfortunate traffic accident.
0.5;But your husband hasn't open \Nthe box in ten years, right?
0.5;The instructions were \Nstill in the same place.
0.5;you should be able to find \Nthe true contents of the box.
0.5;But if you insist, I'll show \Nyou where the page is hidden.
0.5;Does that mean there's something \Ninside the box besides the moonstone?
0.5;why don't you go to the bathroom to take \Nthe cough medicine we got at the hospital?
0.5;If you're going to the \Nbathroom, I'll join you.
0.5;Anyway, I thought Mori-kun left \Nthe bathroom shortly before I did.
0.5;He's taking another stab \Nat opening the trick box.
0.5;It uses sensors to accurately \Ncapture any moving object.
0.5;I was just checking to make sure the \Nanti-theft measures were working...
0.5;Huh? Where are Ran-neechan \Nand Sonoko-neechan?
0.5;They went to the bathroom \Nimmediately after you did.
0.5;I saw some mystery novels I hadn't \Nread yet and couldn't help myself.
0.5;countless cookbooks for me \Nsince I loved to cook so much.
0.5;I read them so often, they were \Npractically falling apart.
0.5;Even if he does come, \Nthe anti-theft mechanisms
0.5;Not even that pretentious \Nthief could manage that.
0.5;Looks like you've figured \Nit out, too, Detective.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Kaito \NKid and the Trick Box, Part Two!"""
0.5;Why does a famous detective like \Nmyself have to look for lost cats?
0.5;Let's use that money to \Nget something good to eat.
0.5;Ah. So, that's why you\Ntagged along, isn't it?
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;You thought something seemed \Nwrong from the entryway.
0.5;Just as you were about to call \Nthe police, he came running up.
0.5;The kid and I entered the \Napartment to check things out,
0.5;I came because they asked me to \Nunlock the door to this apartment.
0.5;She didn't show up on time, \Nso I came to get her.
0.5;so we haven't been able to collect \Nany useful eyewitness information.
0.5;But we did discover that all the cash \Ncards and valuables are missing.
0.5;The man in the living room was \NMaehara Seiichi-san, thirty-two years old.
0.5;He seems to have made a lot \Nof money from stocks recently,
0.5;and transferred several million \Nyen into his bank account.
0.5;She was Seiichi-san's wife, \NMaehara Saki-san, twenty-nine years old.
0.5;The building's security cameras \Ncaptured a suspicious figure,
0.5;thought to be the culprit, entering and \Nexiting the building around 11:00 AM.
0.5;There's also something else \Nthat caught my attention.
0.5;The camera in the emergency \Nstaircase was broken.
0.5;In any case, it's almost \Ncertain that this person
0.5;was involved in the murder \Nof the Maehara couple.
0.5;All that's left is for the \Npolice to find the culprit,
0.5;I think we can assume it was \Nused to commit the crime.
0.5;they were able to confirm that the \Nclothes worn during the murder
0.5;were purchased by Saki-san \Nat a nearby hardware store.
0.5;but the hairs collected from inside \Nthe knit hat matched Saki-san's.
0.5;using the security cameras carried \Nout by the late Saki-san.
0.5;This explains why the camera in the \Nemergency staircase was broken.
0.5;After disguising herself as the \Nrobber and leaving the building,
0.5;she threw away the evidence \Nin the dumpster.
0.5;she needed a path unmonitored \Nby security cameras.
0.5;There wasn't anything \Nparticularly strange about it.
0.5;She probably intended to \Npretend to be a victim,
0.5;She bound her own arms and \Nlegs and entered the closet,
0.5;but the clothes were so heavy \Nshe became unable to breathe.
0.5;Although the truly unfortunate one \Nis the man killed by his wife.
0.5;His expensive suits are \Ngoing to get wrinkled.
0.5;People can put all the effort \Nthey want into their appearances,
0.5;but their true selves can always \Nbe found someplace hidden.
0.5;Hori Maiko-san's fingerprints \Nwere found on the tape, though.
0.5;Since we've determined the identity \Nof the culprit, that should be fine.
0.5;used in this case in the \Napartment's dumpster.
0.5;such damning evidence in a \Nplace so easily discovered?
0.5;She probably thought it would \Nbe collected right away.
0.5;The garbage won't be collected \Nuntil next Monday.
0.5;The weapon would've been \Nleft in the dumpster
0.5;That's when it occurred \Nto me that she may have
0.5;But it was found before she could \Nmove it, and her crime was exposed.
0.5;The natural conclusion \Nto that line of reasoning
0.5;She must have wanted to destroy \Nthe evidence as soon as possible.
0.5;If she was spotted disposing of \Nthe evidence someplace far away,
0.5;the evidence was found in the \Napartment's dumpster.
0.5;There was probably some trouble \Nbetween Saki-san and her accomplice.
0.5;Look at the tape that was \Ncovering Saki-san's mouth.
0.5;It's because Saki-san struggled when her \Naccomplice put the tape on her mouth.
0.5;If she had put it on herself, \Nthere would've only been one mark.
0.5;I don't see anything \Nparticularly out of place.
0.5;There are too many clothes relative \Nto the volume of the closet.
0.5;The expensive suits would've \Nbecome wrinkled, ruining them.
0.5;There are even items such as t-shirts \Nthat would normally be kept in drawers.
0.5;But doesn't that vary from \Nhousehold to household?
0.5;You can tell from looking at the t-shirts and \Nother clothes that they're dirty and creased.
0.5;in the chest of drawers \Nwere crammed onto the rack.
0.5;This must have been one \Nof the folded clothes.
0.5;the crime scene to make \Nit look like an accident.
0.5;Are you sure it wasn't because you had \Nto be the first to discover her body?
0.5;In order to disguise the \Nreason your fingerprints
0.5;were on a piece of evidence, \Nyou had to be the first discoverer.
0.5;Could you show us the \Ncontents of your bag, then?
0.5;Saki-san must've hidden \Nher valuables somewhere.
0.5;However, as you can tell from \Nthe fact that the evidence
0.5;was discarded in the dumpster, \Nshe couldn't have hidden them far.
0.5;it's likely that her accomplice \Ntook them with them.
0.5;I took the emergency staircase \Nto Saki's apartment.
0.5;I didn't have time to move the \Nevidence from the dumpster.
0.5;Even if it were discovered, we \Nwould think Saki-san did it.
0.5;but more than anything, Saki had \Nhelped me since high school.
0.5;I thought I'd have to do as she \Nsaid for the rest of my life.
0.5;It's time to search for \Nan envelope next, mister.
0.5;We came to Kanazawa to help with \Na city revitalization event
0.5;"called the ""Kaga\NHyakumangoku Mystery Tour."""
0.5;and visiting checkpoints like participants\Nwould during the actual event when...
0.5;However, the thief reappeared later\Nand attacked Kogoro-no-occhan,
0.5;but it was all actually \Npart of an event PR prank.
0.5;If she was attacked \Nrandomly by a passerby,
0.5;Which means the murderer specifically \Nwanted to kill Akiyama-san.
0.5;Kogoro solves the case \Nwhile taking a footbath.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery \NTour, Kaga Hot Springs Arc!
0.5;But shouldn't her fiancée \NKuranishi-san stay with her instead?
0.5;Does the old man suspect \None of these guys, too?
0.5;We can wait to call the police until \Nafter we see how Akiyama-san's doing.
0.5;I just don't want to involve the police \Nin a way that will affect the event...
0.5;Being so shaken makes you \Nseem more suspicious.
0.5;Could I see the handwritten \Ncard Akiyama-san gave you?
0.5;These things that fell \Nout of Akiyama-san's bag
0.5;were probably the cards \Nshe prepared beforehand.
0.5;Why did Akiyama-san lie about losing \Nthe cards and write new ones?
0.5;The assault of an elderly person and\Ntheft of five million yen in cash
0.5;We don't have the code because \Nof what happened to Akiyama-san,
0.5;The next checkpoint is Yamashiro \Nhot spring's Iroha Soan.
0.5;participants would have acquired all the \Nhints necessary to solve the mystery by now.
0.5;The participants will use the \Nhints to determine the culprit.
0.5;If they're using the film they \Ntook during the prank for PR,
0.5;Tanimoto-san, you're looking \Nright at the camera.
0.5;Akiyama-san's injury wasn't \Nthat serious, then.
0.5;To be safe, they're going to keep her at the \Nhospital for a day and examine her brain.
0.5;What? Akiyama-san escaped\Nfrom the hospital?!
0.5;She disappeared while Ran left \Nthe room to take my call.
0.5;Probably that she saw the \Nculprit's face or something.
0.5;Do you know where the scissors \Nthat were here went?
0.5;My dad told me to disguise myself as \NAkiyama-san and draw out the culprit.
0.5;I'm going to borrow your\Nsmart phone and coat.
0.5;Mister, you should take off your shoes \Nbefore putting your feet in the bath.
0.5;I first noticed Akiyama-san \Nwasn't wearing her watch
0.5;Until just before that\Nmoment, Akiyama-san...
0.5;Because it wasn't anywhere \Nat the crime scene,
0.5;Was Akiyama-san's hidden \Ncamera inside her watch?
0.5;She actually had a tiny \Ncamera inside her watch.
0.5;you must have remembered the same thing \Nimmediately after committing the crime.
0.5;while pretending to check Akiyama-san's\Npulse, you stole her watch.
0.5;When Conan said he wanted to see \Nthe film you had secretly taken,
0.5;thinking the moment Kuranishi-san \Nremoved her watch may have been recorded,
0.5;He did it to silence her regarding the \Nincident that occurred four years ago.
0.5;What does that four-year-old \Nincident have to do with this one?
0.5;Akiyama-san herself told \Nme using those cards.
0.5;Akiyama-san said she lost her \Ncards and wrote new ones.
0.5;Conan picked them up at the crime scene \Nafter they fell out of Akiyama-san's bag.
0.5;These are the original cards, \Nand these are the new ones.
0.5;the three cards she wrote \Nby hand are different
0.5;I thought perhaps the three \Ncodes had a different meaning,
0.5;in addition to indicating \Nthe checkpoint locations.
0.5;In date format, the numbers \N1056 from the first code
0.5;"Additionally, the G and sword can simply \Nbe read together as ""jiken,"""
0.5;the bottom half of the diamond \Nand the arrowhead are darkened,
0.5;If you place the two symbols \Non top of one another,
0.5;"As you know, ""hoshi"" or ""star"" \Nmeans the culprit in police terminology."
0.5;"reads as ""nishi-san"" if \Nyou don't subtract the values."
0.5;If you read all three \Ncodes together, you get...
0.5;Akiyama-san knew you \Ncommitted that crime, didn't she?
0.5;but she knew and hadn't \Nsaid anything until now.
0.5;It would be a disaster \Nif the charges are false.
0.5;If she didn't say anything, an \Ninnocent man would be accused.
0.5;Akiyama-san realized she \Ncouldn't let this happen,
0.5;Kuranishi-san, you attacked her in \Nan attempt to stop her, didn't you?
0.5;That's why Akiyama-san used the codes \Nto tell me so you wouldn't notice.
0.5;I was so worried Harumi would \Ntell everyone eventually.
0.5;Let's pay for our crime \Nand start over together.
0.5;to let an innocent person be \Narrested to save yourself?
0.5;you even attacked the girlfriend \Nyou planned to marry this spring.
0.5;Though people were concerned the mystery\Nwould be canceled due to the incident...
0.5;I'll do my best to make\Nsure that doesn't happen.
0.5;You truly are a great \Ndetective, Mori Kogoro-san.
0.5;since it's so easy for someone as great\Nas myself to come up with a story.
0.5;You said that you'd be home late\Nsince you're working all day today, right?
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is\N""Happy New Year Mori Kogoro."""
0.5;Encounters are mysterious!\NBut cases are even more so!
0.5;Today is Conan's 100th episode!\NMy first love is about to be found out!
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;"""The Memories of\NFirst Love Case (Part 1)."""
0.5;Thanks for offering to clean\NShinichi's house, Ran-kun.
0.5;It's no problem!\NWe have nothing to do anyway!
0.5;But it will turn into a\Nghost house if we don't clean it...
0.5;Shinichi must be happy to have\Nsuch a thoughtful girlfriend as you!
0.5;You're not thinking of cleaning\Nthe entire house, are you, Ran?
0.5;Well, let's do as much\Nas we can for today.
0.5;Eh? Does that mean we're\Ngoing to clean all day?
0.5;How did Sonoko-sama get stuck\Ncleaning Shinichi-kun's house
0.5;You could've just ignored it,\Nyet you went and got Doc's spare key!
0.5;Sorry! I just figured\Nthe place was covered in dust
0.5;Oh, Sonoko. You should dust\Nthe bookcases before sweeping.
0.5;It's like they say, you should\Nclean from the top down.
0.5;Plus, you're supposed to follow\Nthe tiles when sweeping the floor!
0.5;Girls these days are supposed\Nto be crazy about catching men
0.5;and experiencing pure love,\Nfirst love, and all that...
0.5;Yet here I am, getting covered\Nin dust for that mystery dweeb...
0.5;What do you suppose\NShinichi's first love was like?
0.5;I dunno. He's super-dull in the head\Nwhen it comes to things like that.
0.5;But, given his hot mother,\Nit was probably a TV idol, or...
0.5;Come to think of it, you've always\Nbeen together since you were kids.
0.5;What's more,\Nyou're thoughtful and strong...
0.5;Who knows,\Nmaybe you're his first love!
0.5;Yeah, right! We only played\Ntogether when we were kids!
0.5;Oh? Your bashfulness says\Notherwise, Girl of Twenty Faces.
0.5;Why would he ring the\Ndoorbell to his own house?
0.5;He probably heard about us from\Nthe doc and wants to surprise us!
0.5;B-But Shinichi didn't say\Nanything about coming home...
0.5;What're you so embarrassed about?\NHurry and see him!
0.5;She was student body president\Nduring our first year of middle school!
0.5;Oh. So Kudo-kun has been\Naway for a while on some cases?
0.5;I'm sorry, it's almost like\NI've asked you to clean...
0.5;It's no problem at all!\NI had nothing else to do!
0.5;Anyways, Senpai. Why did you\Nwant to see Shinichi-kun?
0.5;My friends in the university's\Nmystery club are going to rent a lodge
0.5;and hold a birthday\Nparty for me this weekend.
0.5;Seeing as he's a great detective\Nand an old soccer club teammate.
0.5;I wonder if he forgot about\Nthat confession four years ago...
0.5;Though I guess I can't\Nblame him for forgetting.
0.5;First loves are bound\Nto fade away with time...
0.5;Everyone was talking about\Nit our first year of middle school.
0.5;Supposedly a first-year boy\Nmade a pass at Asami-senpai.
0.5;So that daredevil was\Nactually Kudo Shinichi, huh?!
0.5;It wasn't like that.\NIt was an actual confession.
0.5;If Shinichi-niichan won't go,\Nwhy not ask someone else?
0.5;We've solved a few cases\Nourselves, you know!
0.5;Come on! We might be able\Nto catch some lively Toto boys!
0.5;Yes. I think my male friends would\Nlove having high school girls attend.
0.5;Plus, if you invite us, there's\Nno question that he'll come too!
0.5;Yep! The great detective\Nwho needs no introduction!
0.5;A get-together of Toto\NUniversity's mystery study club?
0.5;I can't allow you to go to a\Nsleepover without any real adults!
0.5;I'm busy! I don't have\Ntime to mess with stuff like that!
0.5;Yeah. As a great detective,\Nyou can't relax on a weekend.
0.5;But for the mystery study club,\NMori Kogoro-san is almost like a god.
0.5;Not to mention all the\Npretty girls who'll be there,
0.5;including Uchida Asami-senpai,\Nwho holds the title of Miss Toto!
0.5;But if you're busy,\Nwe'll accept that we can't go either...
0.5;Well, I'm sure I can somehow\Nrearrange my busy schedule
0.5;Besides, I wouldn't want to\Ndisappoint all the promising youngsters
0.5;If my stories about the cases\NI've solved can help them in any way,
0.5;it may be my duty as\Na great detective to assist!
0.5;The bus stop is here,\Nso we go up and right...
0.5;Oh! Over there?\NMiss Toto isn't too far now! Let's go!
0.5;...being able to talk and drink\Nwith the young minds of Toto U.!
0.5;Not only that, you're all\Ngood-looking boys and pretty girls!
0.5;Hey, now! This is\NAsami's birthday party!
0.5;I heard you made it\Nto the final selection, too.
0.5;I lost to her pair in the Literature\NDepartment's tennis tournament!
0.5;Plus she was named\NMiss Toto as a freshman!
0.5;I didn't even make it through\Nthe preliminary round...
0.5;I really admire her. She can do\Neverything, but doesn't act conceited.
0.5;Speaking of which,\Nwhere is her lemon pie?
0.5;She said she would make\None for me, so I asked her to.
0.5;Geez. Why're you making\Nstuff you don't know how to?
0.5;Now, now. Save your criticism\Nuntil after you've tried it.
0.5;See? With cooking,\Nsubstance is what matters.
0.5;I've solved every\Ncase 100% of the time!
0.5;Oh, that's okay. I borrowed\NSawai-kun's lighter.
0.5;At any age, watching birthday\Ncandles being lit is so exciting!
0.5;Yeah. Once you're over 20,\Nyou start to hate each extra candle.
0.5;See? It's good we got\Na lodge with a fax machine!
0.5;No way. What should\Nwe do with the cake?
0.5;Aren't we supposed to go to the\Nkaraoke place by the station next?
0.5;Yeah. Nothing else\Nwe can do. Let's do that.
0.5;Say, little boy. Want to sing\NTwo-Mix with me next?
0.5;Smart and beautiful,\Na sports warrior and scholar...
0.5;Considerate, popular,\Nand ♪1 at everything...
0.5;You're thinking about\NAsami-senpai, aren't you?
0.5;"""I'm no match for her!""\Nis written all over your face!"
0.5;But you can't blame\NShinichi-kun for falling for her.
0.5;But don't worry about it!\NShe must've rejected him anyway!
0.5;Did you know Shinichi\Nloves lemon pie, Sonoko?
0.5;I heard it for the first time\Ntoday from Asami-senpai.
0.5;I told everyone I'd make one\Nbecause I thought he'd come today,
0.5;I can teach you how\Nto make it if you'd like!
0.5;She knows so much\Nabout Shinichi that I don't.
0.5;C'mon, cheer up! You have\Nyour own good qualities too!
0.5;You know! You are strong and\Nbrawny 'cause you practice karate!
0.5;Because you were taking\Nso long in the bathroom.
0.5;Everyone ran off to the\Nbathrooms by the train station.
0.5;I bought some at the\Nconvenience store next door!
0.5;"""What's the problem""?!\NThe lodge we rented is on fire!"
0.5;Please be all right,\NAsami-senpai!
0.5;Not good! It doesn't look\Nlike she fled outside!
0.5;D-Don't tell me she's\Nstill asleep inside?!
0.5;Hey! Move that motorcycle!\NWe don't want its gasoline to ignite!
0.5;A hospital near the lodge.\NThey brought you here afterwards.
0.5;Other than a little carbon\Nmonoxide poisoning, she's just fine!
0.5;What're you talking about?\NYou're the one who saved her!
0.5;And Sawai-san led the way\Nto safety after I found her...
0.5;I felt relieved when I got outside,\Nbut things got blurry...
0.5;But that was amazing! You busted\Ninside with that helmet on!
0.5;Even the firefighters said that\Nit wasn't smart to go into the fire,
0.5;but wearing the helmet\Nwas the correct thing to do!
0.5;He gave it to me just as\NI was about to run inside.
0.5;He said I should put it on to protect\Nmy hair and face from the flames.
0.5;Conan-kun did? He's as\Nstrange a kid as always...
0.5;Yes. People in nearby lodges\Nsaid they saw smoke.
0.5;Yes. It probably fell\Nonto the floor while still lit,
0.5;where it ignited the nearby\Nwrapping paper and curtains.
0.5;It couldn't be helped.\NWe were all in a hurry when we left.
0.5;If she didn't forget to put it out,\Nthere's one other possibility...
0.5;The possibility that Asami-san\Nherself lit the fire in the living room!
0.5;She must've left while we were\Ngetting something to drink!
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shooting comet!
0.5;Conan's logic heals hearts\Ndried by modern society!
0.5;Today's case is\Nthe darkness of night.
0.5;Dark mysteries need\Nthe light of logic!
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;Ugh! You ordered nothing\Nbut expensive food!
0.5;Yeah! He's his college friend\Nthat we met at the hot springs!
0.5;This is perfect timing, Mori.\NI need to talk to you...
0.5;There's this strange sound\Noutside my apartment every night.
0.5;It's a thump, as if something's\Nhitting the outside wall.
0.5;Probably just some\Nkids up to no good.
0.5;I thought so too, but there was\Nnobody outside when I checked,
0.5;and it's been going\Non for a whole week now.
0.5;Alright! Just leave it\Nto the great Mori Kogoro!
0.5;I thought you were here\Nto investigate the weird sound.
0.5;A blow to the head\Nwith a blunt object...
0.5;The victim is Ikuta\NYoshiro-san, 20 years old.
0.5;Could you explain the\Nsituation as you found it?
0.5;But just as I called out to him,\Nhe suddenly collapsed...
0.5;But it was really\Ntoo dark to see much...
0.5;I was just drinking with Ikuta\Nin our friend's apartment.
0.5;Nakamura. We're all members\Nof the mountain climbing club.
0.5;Yes, I invited everyone over.\NWe've been here since 7:00...
0.5;A little before 10:00.\NKusaka had called at 9:00.
0.5;Yeah. Ikuta wasn't here,\Nso I answered for him.
0.5;You're certain it was\NKusaka-san's voice on the phone?
0.5;Then how did you\Ndecide where to meet?
0.5;Ikuta asked me there.\NHe put a note in my locker.
0.5;Ikuta took the tuition\Nmoney I took to school...
0.5;Ikuta-san stole your tuition\Nmoney and refused to give it back.
0.5;So you phoned him out of\Nanger and beat him to death!
0.5;No! Besides, I'm not the\Nonly one who hated him!
0.5;I was in here the whole time!\NRight, Shimizu?
0.5;Yeah. But you did step\Nout for some fresh air.
0.5;And why did you have \Na grudge against Ikuta-san?
0.5;Ikuta and Togawa Keiko got stranded\Nin the mountains six months ago.
0.5;Ikuta abandoned the injured\NKeiko and left by himself.
0.5;She had already frozen\Nto death when we found her.
0.5;In mountain accidents, sometimes\Nyou have to abandon your friends.
0.5;I feel bad about Keiko,\Nbut I don't blame Ikuta at all!
0.5;Besides, I never took a single\Nstep out of this apartment!
0.5;"That's true; he was\Ninside the whole time."
0.5;At 10:00, he went to the next\Nroom to finish a report for class.
0.5;But you can't get outside\Nwithout going through this room,
0.5;so I can't see how\Nhe could've done it.
0.5;Not from that window.\NSee for yourself.
0.5;No way anyone could\Nleave through here.
0.5;The lights weren't\Non in this room then.
0.5;As there's no way through that\Nwindow, Takeno-san is innocent!
0.5;Ikuta-san must've\Nbeen a heavy smoker.
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nwhy did the window break then?!
0.5;Odd. Whatever broke\Nthe window isn't in here.
0.5;Is it the victim's?!\NBut what's it doing here?!
0.5;That bloodstain,\Nthe place he was standing,
0.5;and Omura-san's broken\Nwindow all line up!
0.5;...at the top of this\Nbuilding, there's--
0.5;And there's\NTakeno-san's apartment!
0.5;Could I ask you to\Ncome down to the station?
0.5;I will now shed light\Non the truth of this incident.
0.5;The key to this incident is\Nthe location of the murder weapon.
0.5;A bloodstain was left behind\Non the nearby abandoned building,
0.5;but there's one other\Nplace with a bloodstain.
0.5;Immediately after the murder,\NOmura's window shattered.
0.5;There was blood\Non the pieces of glass.
0.5;Before I explain,\NI'd like you to check something.
0.5;If I'm correct, there should\Nbe blood on the railing
0.5;I'd like him to help\Nwith something later on.
0.5;Inspector! There's blood\Non the railing here!
0.5;The wall, the railing, the glass\Nshards in Omura-san's apartment...
0.5;Why is there blood\Nat these three spots?!
0.5;The weapon that killed Ikuta-san\Npassed by those three spots.
0.5;In other words, the killer\Naccomplished his murder from afar.
0.5;Yes. The killer had\Nbeen in this very room...
0.5;I couldn't possibly\Nkill him from here!
0.5;Ran. Put some rocks in\Nthat plastic bag you got earlier.
0.5;Tie two strands of\Nfishing line to a rock.
0.5;Once you're done,\Nuse Takeno-san's slingshot
0.5;"It's only a dozen meters away;\Nthe length of a few taxicabs."
0.5;pass them through the railing,\Nand then tie them together.
0.5;Tie one of the\Nlines to one end of it.
0.5;Ran. Tie the bag to\Nthe other end of the rope.
0.5;The bag passed directly above\Nthe chalk lines and hit the wall!
0.5;and then pulled the\Nrope in to recover the weapon.
0.5;This would leave no\Nweapon at the murder scene.
0.5;Inspector! The bag just hit\Nbelow Omura-san's broken window!
0.5;Mori! Could that be the\Nthump I heard every night?
0.5;But something unexpected\Nhappened tonight:
0.5;Ikuta went down there because\NKusaka asked him to on the phone!
0.5;Had he not called,\NI couldn't have set that trick up!
0.5;by recording the sound and\Nsetting a timer on it.
0.5;All he had left to do\Nwas pick up the phone
0.5;and pretend like he\Nwas talking to Kusaka-san.
0.5;It was also Takeno-san who put\Nthe note in Kusaka-san's locker.
0.5;All to frame him\Nfor Ikuta-san's murder!
0.5;But how did he know where\NIkuta-san was standing?
0.5;It was pitch-black\Nwith the streetlight broken...
0.5;Takeno-san broke it in advance\Nto make us think that way.
0.5;No, he knew where Ikuta-san was,\Neven in the dark.
0.5;What was Ikuta-san doing on\Nyour way back from the store?
0.5;Well, he was standing\Nbeneath the broken streetlight...
0.5;As a heavy smoker, Ikuta-san\Ndropped lots of cigarette butts.
0.5;Takeno-san. You aimed\Nat the light from the cigarette
0.5;You had the lights off to prevent\Nanyone from seeing the weapon!
0.5;Then check the apartment!\NI have no plastic bags!
0.5;Those are some thick\Nsocks for this time of year.
0.5;You turned them inside-out\Nand filled them with rocks.
0.5;Later, you put the rocks in\Nthe fish tank and fixed your socks.
0.5;As proof, there's a\Nthread in the water plant!
0.5;One that's the same\Ncolor as your socks.
0.5;These are sturdy enough to be\Nused as the weapon and not rip...
0.5;There should be blood\Non the inside of those socks.
0.5;Did you do it because of\NTogawa Keiko-san's death?
0.5;As I said, sometimes you have to\Nabandon friends in mountain accidents.
0.5;I constantly told myself\NI couldn't blame Ikuta.
0.5;But when I think about\Nnever seeing her again,
0.5;I feel as if I've been\Nleft all alone in this world,
0.5;I was so lonely that\NI felt I was going crazy.
0.5;He had to pay for letting my\Nprecious Keiko die for no reason!
0.5;And so did Kusaka,\Nwho laughed at the story!
0.5;Nothing beats beer after\Nsolving a crime! It's the greatest!
0.5;"It's getting late;\Nwe should call it quits for--"
0.5;Don't say that!\NLet's get this party goin'!
0.5;Tonight was the Tanabata, the one\Nday a year that lovers can meet.
0.5;I'm sure he's looking\Nup at the same starry sky!
0.5;This geezer is that\Nlegendary detective?!
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na broken satellite!
0.5;Conan's logic is good medicine\Nfor hearts tired by modern society!
0.5;Today's a tearful conclusion!\NDepend on him for the case and feelings!
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;Sonoko, Ran, and I went\Nout skiing on our day off.
0.5;There, we met their old grade\Nschool teacher, Yonehara-sensei,
0.5;That night, someone attacked\NSonoko and Yonehara-sensei
0.5;and the overdue Sugiyama-sensei\Nwas found strangled to death!
0.5;"On each of their hands was\Na ""mi"", ""na"", and ""ko""..."
0.5;Upon seeing this, Shimoda-sensei\Nholed himself up in his room!
0.5;I learned there was a suicide at\NHaido Elementary three years ago
0.5;and that the name of the deceased\Nstudent was Mochizuki Minako.
0.5;The upstairs windows don't open,\Nand there aren't any exits!
0.5;You're sure there's\Nno murder weapon, kid?
0.5;See how he has rope marks,\Njust like Sugiyama-sensei did?
0.5;But, I don't see\Nany rope in the room.
0.5;Does that mean the killer\Nran off somewhere with the rope?
0.5;but didn't find any\Nsuspicious people or rope.
0.5;...then one of you is the killer\Nand is still carrying the rope.
0.5;Get serious.\NThis is my first time upstairs.
0.5;Besides, if I were the killer, this brat\Nwould've seen me go downstairs.
0.5;Anyways, whoever has\Nthe rope is the killer.
0.5;You're so dumb!\NThere was no rope!
0.5;Never thought I'd get\Nstripped down in this weather!
0.5;But, is it true that\NShimoda-sensei was murdered...
0.5;But, when I opened his\Ndoor to check, he was already--
0.5;The sound turned out to\Nbe his phone's alarm clock...
0.5;Huh? I thought you\Nhad a downstairs room?
0.5;Yes, but I moved upstairs\Nafter you broke my door.
0.5;But, if neither of\Nus is the killer, then...
0.5;Huh? You're done\Nbody-searching already?
0.5;Which means there's\Nonly one possibility.
0.5;So, the killer might\Nstill be inside the lodge?!
0.5;Oh, no! Sonoko's\Nstill asleep downstairs!
0.5;The killer is definitely\None of those three!
0.5;But why?! Why won't\Nthe weapon turn up?!
0.5;It's all right.\NShe's just sleeping.
0.5;Ran! It's terrible! Yonehara-sensei\Nwas murdered in her room!
0.5;And then the killer strangled\Nme with rope, like this...
0.5;No, but I had my forehead\Nbashed into the wall instead.
0.5;But I'm glad you're all right!\NI always looked up to you!
0.5;Not just her! All the girls\Nin our class looked up to you!
0.5;I couldn't even help you today\Nwhen you were attacked...
0.5;That's how the students covered\Nfor you three years ago, too.
0.5;You were the teacher for the girl\Nwho killed herself, Mochizuki Minako.
0.5;If the killer's goal\Nis to avenge her death,
0.5;then it's not surprising\Nyou were attacked first.
0.5;And, she was Nakamura-sensei's\Nfavorite in the Health Committee.
0.5;It looks like this murder\Nmystery will continue yet.
0.5;Let's gather in the living\Nroom and wait for the police!
0.5;Think! There's gotta be a\Nkey to unlocking this mystery!
0.5;There's a broken\Nrubber band on the end.
0.5;OK! I've figured out\Nthe ringing-doorbell trick!
0.5;That just leaves\Nthe murder weapon, now!
0.5;That's it! I've figured out\Nthe disappearing-weapon trick!
0.5;"I can't use Sonoko as a detective;\Nshe barely knows what happened!"
0.5;And I can't use Ran! I can't fool\Nher afterwards like I can Sonoko!
0.5;My best bet is to pretend\NI heard everything from Conan
0.5;and then use my real voice\Nto explain it over the phone...
0.5;No! If I do that with him there,\Nit'll get into the paper!
0.5;Those men in black\Nwho shrunk me with a pill!
0.5;Wait! He mentioned that my\NVoice-Altering Bow Tie can transmit to it!
0.5;I figured out who killed\Nthe two teachers at that lodge!
0.5;Conan-kun told me.\NNow, I need you to do something.
0.5;Explain the truth\Nto everyone in my place!
0.5;Yeah. I'll say it over the phone,\Nso you just repeat it...
0.5;No way! You can tell everyone\Nover the phone yourself!
0.5;I'll tell the police\Nwhen they get there.
0.5;I just put this on my ear\Nand say what you say, right?
0.5;Let's go back \Nto the others, Conan-kun!
0.5;We're gonna get the person who\Nattacked Sonoko and Yonehara-sensei
0.5;Incident #1, in which Yonehara-sensei\Nand Sonoko were attacked...
0.5;Incident #2, in which the\Nstrangled Sugiyama-sensei
0.5;was set by the\Ndoor to ring the doorbell...
0.5;Incident #3, in which the killer\Nstrangled Shimoda-sensei upstairs
0.5;and disappeared\Nwith the murder weapon...
0.5;I've figured out the one\Nbehind these three incidents.
0.5;But, are you prepared for\Nwhat happens if you're wrong?
0.5;You'd naturally\Nbe hit with a libel suit.
0.5;If I put it in the paper and\Nyou're wrong, you'll be expelled!
0.5;It's all right. If you just\Ntrust me and say what I say,
0.5;"""Daughter of Great Mori Kogoro\NSolves Murder Case at Ski Lodge""!"
0.5;When the doorbell rang\Nduring Incident #2,
0.5;everyone was here in\Nthe living room but you three!
0.5;Yes, that would\Nseem impossible. But...
0.5;...with this fishing line and\Nthe rubber band at the end,
0.5;You tie the rubber\Nband to one end of the line,
0.5;wrap the line around\Nthe two pillars by the door,
0.5;then tie the other end to the rubber\Nband while making a small loop.
0.5;Then, you attach the rubber band to\Nthe stiff Sugiyama-sensei's neck,
0.5;lean him toward the door,\Nand support his feet with snow.
0.5;Naturally, you measure the line so\Nhe'll stop just before the doorbell.
0.5;Given time, the rubber band\Nwill snap due to the cold
0.5;and the body will\Nfall and ring the doorbell.
0.5;The fishing line would then blow\Naway and vanish from the scene.
0.5;So, the killer murdered Sugiyama-sensei\Nhours before so he'd be stiff?
0.5;The killer most likely called\Nhim out here and killed him
0.5;After all, Conan-kun \Nsaw icicles when we arrived.
0.5;Icicles couldn't have formed unless\Nsomeone had been using the heater.
0.5;Proof over theory!\NGo see for yourself!
0.5;A ski I set up, using the\Nsame trick as I just explained.
0.5;But, the mystery behind\NIncident #3 has yet to be solved...
0.5;I'll explain that\Nback in the living room.
0.5;Just wait! I'm about\Nto beat your attacker hollow!
0.5;the mysterious trick used to make\Nthe rope disappear from upstairs.
0.5;The killer never intended\Nto make it vanish to scare us all.
0.5;It only looked that way because\NConan-kun happened to be by the stairs
0.5;we would've thought the killer\Nhad fled downstairs with the weapon,
0.5;allowing them to escape\Nsuspicion as they were still upstairs.
0.5;That's why they set the phone off\Nand had the body found right away.
0.5;their clever trick to get rid of\Nthe weapon would've been in vain!
0.5;Then explain this\Nweapon-disappearing trick already...
0.5;The rope wasn't in\Nany of the upstairs rooms.
0.5;Because it's still\Nin the killer's possession!
0.5;Impossible!\NWe searched all three of them!
0.5;...and attacked Yonehara-sensei\Nand Sonoko was...
0.5;She braided her hair like a rope\Nand strangled Shimoda-sensei with it,
0.5;But, as long as her hair is, she\Ncouldn't just strangle people with it!
0.5;This was wrapped around\N Shimoda-sensei's neck.
0.5;Its cuticle has been\Nremoved for easy processing,
0.5;And, with her long hair,\Nshe's the only one capable of this trick!
0.5;That can't be! I saw her lying right\Nthere when I was being strangled!
0.5;That was probably \NSugiyama-sensei's body...
0.5;she dressed up his body,\Nwhich she hid under her bed, just like her!
0.5;After luring Sonoko\Nfrom the next room over,
0.5;she hid the body\Nunder the bed again
0.5;so we'd think the attacker\Nran out the window, of course.
0.5;Thus, she would look like\Na victim of the attacker,
0.5;making it easier to get near\NShimoda-sensei, her next target...
0.5;Yonehara-sensei most likely called\Nhim on his cell phone and said this:
0.5;"""I know who did it.\NLet me in and I'll tell you."""
0.5;There's still proof in\Nyour wig that you're the killer...
0.5;So, there should\Nbe some on that wig...
0.5;Blood that matches\Nhis scratches' perfectly!
0.5;"Your motive was likely the ""Minako""\Nwritten on the victims' hands..."
0.5;To avenge my student murdered\Nthree years ago, Mochizuki Minako!
0.5;She said two teachers were\Nhelping kids cheat on entrance exams.
0.5;She told me one was Sugiyama-sensei,\Nbut she didn't name the other.
0.5;She was shocked\Nit was one she looked up to,
0.5;so she was going\Nto ask them herself.
0.5;The next day, she hanged\Nherself in the volleyball room.
0.5;But I knew Sugiyama-sensei\N and someone else
0.5;So, I gathered teachers she\Nliked and planned this ski tour.
0.5;You all know the result. I quickly\Nlearned it was Shimoda-sensei.
0.5;As fellow teachers, they had to pay\Nfor betraying and killing a student
0.5;I troubled Suzuki-san\Nfor my own trick...
0.5;As agreed, I'm gonna write an article\Nabout that great detective work,

0.5;That's okay,\Nlet's just have fun skiing!
0.5;It's okay for you \Nsince you have Shinichi-kun!

0.5;But, what about these\Nnice instructor friends of yours?
0.5;So, you both work with\NYonehara-sensei at Haido Elementary?
0.5;...and boys P.E. instructor,\NSakai-sensei.
0.5;But, grade school teachers trying\Nto pick up high school girls...
0.5;Where could he be? \NSugiyama-sensei sure is late...
0.5;We agreed to meet\Nhere at 2:00, but he's late...
0.5;Do you suppose he went on\Nahead to the lodge we're staying at
0.5;It's very possible.\NHe loves that sort of thing.
0.5;Would you like to\Ncome to the lodge, too?
0.5;Don't worry! We'll drive 'em back\Nin time for their ski bus home!
0.5;Pardon me! Are there\Nany lodges around here?
0.5;Yeah, there's one\Nhalfway up that mountain,
0.5;but don't tell me\Nyou're goin' up there?
0.5;This area gets pounded\Nby blizzards every evening!
0.5;But Sugiyama-sensei \Nmight be waiting for us...
0.5;Ugh! Who booked us\Nout here, anyway?
0.5;I just did what that card I found in\Nmy desk two weeks ago said to do,
0.5;No. Plus, there was another\Nnote in my desk yesterday...
0.5;A list of the attendees and a map\Nto the meeting place and lodge!
0.5;I got one, too!\NWho could've put them there?
0.5;Maybe the person\Nwith the key to the place?
0.5;Someone here must have gotten\Nit from the lodge's owner.
0.5;I have the key. I found it\Nin my desk yesterday...
0.5;Me. Sugiyama-sensei \Ncalled me last night
0.5;Then, wasn't he the\None who planned all this?!
0.5;Conan-kun, what're you doing?\NLet's go inside!
0.5;But I don't think we\Ncan leave in this blizzard...
0.5;Sorry. I'll phone your parents,\Nso stay here tonight.
0.5;But, is it really OK\Nto rent such a fancy lodge?
0.5;Let's have Sugiyama-sensei pay,\Nsince he planned this tour!
0.5;Sorry for taking so long, \NSugiyama-sensei--
0.5;I got a tip-off that something's\Ngonna happen here tonight...
0.5;I parked in the forest and waited\Nfor you when a blizzard suddenly hit.
0.5;"""Haido Elementary Teacher\NThrows Reporter Out Into Blizzard."""
0.5;Huh? Where are\NYonehara-sensei and the others?
0.5;Dunno. Everyone\Nsuddenly stopped talking...
0.5;And we were having so much fun.\NThat guy ruined it all!
0.5;Forget about him and\Nhelp me make everyone's beds.
0.5;And you two can help \NNakamura-sensei with dinner.
0.5;Say, has Sugiyama-sensei\Ncalled or anything yet?
0.5;No. I got his machine at home,\Nso I think he's on his way...
0.5;Someone covered my mouth from\Nbehind while I was making the bed,
0.5;knocking someone out with a\Nhandkerchief soaked in chloroform.
0.5;She was strangled with\Nit after she was knocked out.
0.5;I put up a fight, but I don't know\Nwhat happened after I passed out...
0.5;Yeah. I even had my\Nhead bashed into the wall!
0.5;Look! There's some\Non Sonoko's hand, too!
0.5;Now, you won't have to bend\Nthe truth like you did three years ago.
0.5;Enough already!\NAre you still stuck on that?!
0.5;I was in front of the fireplace\Nwhen that girl screamed.
0.5;Anyways, is it really a good idea\Nto have a brat chase the culprit alone?
0.5;She must have inhaled\Ntoo much chloroform.
0.5;Anyways, was the stuff\Nabout the footprints true?
0.5;Yes. They went from\Nthe window to the front door.
0.5;But who says\Nthe attacker made them?
0.5;Ran-neechan kicked the door\Ndown 'cause it was locked.
0.5;So, the attacker might've\Ntaken refuge inside the lodge?!
0.5;It's probably just \NSugiyama-sensei's doing!
0.5;I thought so!\NThat jerk did all this to scare us!
0.5;Get serious! Myself aside,\NSuzuki-san has been strangled!
0.5;Still, what could\NSugiyama-sensei be thinking?!
0.5;I bet he can't come\Nout now that it's not funny!
0.5;Where were you when there\Nwere two women being attacked?!
0.5;I was in my room listening\Nto music on my headphones!

0.5;Just wait a little more.\NIt's cooking right now.
0.5;No problem. There was\Nan extra helping, anyways...
0.5;She said they'll eat when\NSonoko-chan wakes up.
0.5;Oh. We sure have\Ninconvenienced her...
0.5;Alright, Sugiyama!\NWe know you're in here!
0.5;Quit sneaking around\Nand get out-- Eh?
0.5;Yes. We're all right.\NThe heater's working.
0.5;It was snowing, so he was worried\Nif the heater was working or not.
0.5;How odd. There's definitely\Nsomething going on in this lodge...
0.5;First, is the incident three years\Nago everybody's tight-lipped about!
0.5;Eh? An incident at Haido\NElementary three years ago?
0.5;There should be case files\Nin my dad's study!
0.5;Just hurry! I got a\Nbad feeling about this!
0.5;If we don't hurry,\Nsomeone else might--
0.5;What're ya doin'?\NCome inside already!
0.5;Hey! What's wrong?!\NSugiyama-sensei! Say something!
0.5;Though that means he was\Nkilled over nine hours ago...
0.5;The fact that his body rang the\Nbell means someone set him there...
0.5;But, we were all eating\Nby the fireplace when it rang...
0.5;Probably the one who attacked\NYonehara-sensei and Sonoko-neechan.
0.5;He has a letter written\Nin lipstick just like they did!
0.5;"Yonehara-sensei had ""mi"" and\NSonoko-neechan had ""na"", which makes:"
0.5;Shimoda-sensei!\NIt's Yonehara! Open the door!
0.5;Yes, we found Sugiyama-sensei's\Nbody leaning by the front door...
0.5;They could've snuck inside while\Nwe were all gathered at the door...
0.5;Don't worry. Sakai-sensei is\Ncalling the police as we speak...
0.5;They said it's too dangerous\Nto send cars in the blizzard,
0.5;so we gotta wait until it\Ndies down in the morning!
0.5;So, they want us to sit\Nhere until morning?!
0.5;Why did all this have to happen?\NIt was such a fun ski tour...
0.5;He's the one who found\Neveryone's lunch money
0.5;Oh, that cheeky runt from the class\Nnext door who acted like a detective?
0.5;Come to think of it, I did see him\Nin the papers. I think his name was--
0.5;A brilliant sixteen year old detective\Nwho handled unsolvable cases...
0.5;He was pretty good for a kid,\Nso I was gonna do a feature on him,
0.5;Rumor has it he croaked after\Npoking his nose into some case.
0.5;to not take your eyes off that\Nguy holed up in his room upstairs...
0.5;If my reporter's instinct\Nis right, he'll be next to go.
0.5;But, the more casualties, the better\Nthe article and the better for me.
0.5;Yeah, right. The upstairs\Nwindows don't open,
0.5;and he won't get\Nattacked if he's holed up.
0.5;But, he is a bit agitated.\NIt's dangerous to leave him alone!
0.5;Nakamura-sensei and I will\Nmake some, so you go be with him.
0.5;Be extra careful!\NThe killer could be hiding inside!
0.5;Here you are, Mori-san! \NCoffee and cocoa!
0.5;When the doorbell rang, everyone was\Ntogether but Ran and Sonoko,
0.5;so it was definitely someone\Nelse who placed the body here...
0.5;Huh? Only that part of\Nthe railing is missing snow...
0.5;Then let's leave him alone,\Nlock our rooms,
0.5;Three years ago, a girl hanged\Nherself in the volleyball room

0.5;It's not listed here,\Nbut the girl's name is...

0.5;What're you doing there,\NConan-kun?

0.5;the club's policy of accepting \Nletters instead of e-mails
0.5;Believing the initials EC referred \Nto herself, Chikada Eimi,
0.5;she asked her new friend Sonoko \Nwho she met at her job for help.
0.5;Pranks with hot peppers and toy \Nspiders are innocent enough.
0.5;But cutting a girl's hair is \Na real crime! It's assault!
0.5;Based on the escalating threats and time \Nlimit, it didn't seem like a prank.
0.5;We found girls named Baba, \NBando, and Bito immediately.
0.5;But none of them felt threatened \Nor even knew about Club Orihime.
0.5;There was something I found odd \Nabout this, and that was...

0.5;They received countless letters \Nfrom girls madly in love with you.
0.5;You cut that girl's hair with a utility \Nknife in Club Orihime's room, didn't you?
0.5;That's the same handwriting \Nas the warning letters.
0.5;I waited about five minutes, but \Nno one came, so I came back here.
0.5;You made up this story \Nso you'd have an alibi.
0.5;Eimi-san, did you write \Nany letters about Romeo?
0.5;Oh, right. All the victims \Nhave Romeo in common.
0.5;There's no way you'd fall \Nin love with that guy.

0.5;And if the second letter's CT \Nare Juliet's house of Capulet...
0.5;Neither house allowed \NRomeo and Juliet's love.
0.5;Then the third letter's EC \Ndon't just stand for Eimi-san.

0.5;You stole it from Romeo, or \NKariya-kun, so you could set him up.
0.5;But if he did it, he wouldn't have \Nleft that at the scene of the crime.
0.5;That's why you had to \Nthrow it out the window.
0.5;Considering you meant to use it again \Nlater, it was two birds with one stone.
0.5;That's why Conan-kun found the hole left by \Nthe knife in the flowerbed under the window.
0.5;Naturally, you're the only \Nperson who could have thrown
0.5;Then you e-mailed Kariya-kun \Nso he wouldn't have an alibi

0.5;and it's hard to imagine jewelry theft \Ngoing well in this day and age.
0.5;If you're not busy, could you \Nhelp me hand out these fliers?
0.5;Nothing of note happened for \Nseveral days after that.
0.5;Don't take any detours. \NHead straight to school.
0.5;Like pretending to do construction work \Nso they can rob the jewelry store?
0.5;The president of the engineering \Nfirm over there is named Kumazawa.
0.5;We've known each other since middle school, \Nso he's given me a special discount.
0.5;so you can steal the watch \Nfrom the jeweler next door?
0.5;If I punched a hole in that wall \Nand stole some jewels, I'd be rich.
0.5;I may not look like it, but the \Nonly thing I can do is make coffee.
0.5;It's certainly risky to rob \Nthe jewelry store next door.
0.5;Then nothing in particular \Nhappened for several days.
0.5;What if it's actually the \Nlady from the produce store?
0.5;You're right, Haibara-san. \NIt's certainly possible.
0.5;Let's all keep an eye out \Nso there is no burglary.
0.5;With no crime, there wasn't \Nanything Conan-kun could do,
0.5;but several days later,\Nthat fateful day would come.
0.5;Thanks to you, I think I got better \Nat keeping an illustrated diary.
0.5;Carefully observe all kinds of things, \Nand you'll discover the truth.
0.5;You should observe your \Nsurroundings in your own way.
0.5;I'm sure you'll find \Nsomething to write about.
0.5;Since then, like you said, I've been \Ncarefully observing my surroundings every day.
0.5;When I started writing exactly what \NI saw and felt, I got better at it.
0.5;Didn't Michiyo-chan from \Nthe class next door—
0.5;There's still a lot I need\Nto confirm, though.
0.5;You heard an expensive luxury watch \Nwas on display at Jewelry Kaneko.
0.5;you heard Café Haronbo was renovating \Nits store and came up with your plan.
0.5;The renovation work being done at \Nthe café next to the jewelry store
0.5;to enter the jeweler from the \Nproduce store on the opposite side.
0.5;As long as the cafe was \Nundergoing renovations,
0.5;no matter how much noise you \Nmade, no one would suspect you.
0.5;Then you just needed the produce \Nstore workers to go away.
0.5;You probably learned the grocer loves \Nprize contests from that conversation
0.5;Even if you sold it so it couldn't be \Ntraced, it'd probably go for at least 70 million.
0.5;I heard you can get several times the market \Nprice if you sell it to a collector.
0.5;If I got that much money, I'd \Ntake my family to Hawaii.
0.5;Speaking of which, did you win that trip \Nto Hawaii you mentioned the other day?
0.5;It says the shop is temporary closed \Nbecause they're on a family trip.
0.5;You've been digging for five days since \Nthey went on their trip, haven't you?
0.5;The culprit Fujioka-san was \Narrested by Detective Takagi.
0.5;Conan-kun said he figured \Nout the culprit's trick
0.5;from my illustrations of Michiyo-chan \Nand the three buildings in a row.
0.5;who was having a conversation \Nin front of the jeweler.
0.5;was that he accurately named \Nthe black market price.
0.5;Conan-kun called the \NCheetah Transport company
0.5;and determined that Fujioka-san \Nhad missed work for five days.
0.5;Conan-kun said he couldn't \Nhave solved this case
0.5;In other words, this was my first big \Nsuccess as a member of the Detective Boys.
0.5;Detective Takagi treated us to lots of tasty \Nfood at Poirot to thank us for preventing a crime.
0.5;Hey, wait. This isn't an \Nall-you-can-eat restaurant, kids.
0.5;Why don't you show a little more \Nconsideration for your family?
0.5;You mentioned something \Nabout the gears of tragedy.
0.5;It wasn't you who turned \Nthem, but the culprit.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The \NAutomatic Tragedy, Part One!"""
0.5;They've got holes in the \Nmiddle. We'll be fine.
0.5;They said they're low calorie \Nsince they're low sugar.
0.5;Eat too much of anything, \Nand you'll still get fat.
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!
0.5;What shocking truth will the \Nhigh school detective reveal?
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Our staff member Sakai takes \Ngreat care of our yard.
0.5;They're low sugar and made to order, \Nso you can enjoy them fresh.
0.5;But judging by the state of things, this \Nplace's popularity suddenly spiked and waned.
0.5;I brought the soy pulp \Nout of the storage room.
0.5;Also, one shibazuke and cream \Ndonut, two matcha and mayo donuts,
0.5;two chocolate dream donuts, one plain \Ndonut, and one molasses crepe parfait.
0.5;These are lighter than \Nexpected, don't you think?
0.5;There's sourness and saltiness \Nbehind the sweetness, too.
0.5;The sound of frying donuts really \Nwhets the appetite, doesn't it?
0.5;He keeps looking around \Neverywhere. He seems restless.
0.5;It's more like he's observing \Ndonuts, not eating them.
0.5;There isn't a single decent \Ncustomer in this place.
0.5;Speaking of eating too much, \Nit looks like he did, too.
0.5;They seemed pretty high-level \Nfor low sugar donuts.
0.5;We'll be fine. That's why \Nthey're low sugar, right?
0.5;The culprit used those gloves on the ground \Nto avoiding leaving fingerprints behind.
0.5;In any case, let's call an \Nambulance and the police.
0.5;The victim is Tomita Satoshi-san, \Nthe owner of this café.
0.5;He was struck on the back of the head with \Na blunt object while in the café's bathroom.
0.5;At that time, these people \Nwere inside the café.
0.5;you always come to scout out our café \Nand steal our recipes, don't you?
0.5;You gathered us here because you think \None of us is the culprit, don't you?
0.5;For someone to attack the \Nmanager in the bathroom,
0.5;they would've had to pass through this café \Nwhere you could have seen them, correct?
0.5;The only person who left this room while \Nthe manager was in the bathroom was...
0.5;More importantly, Furukawa is \Nway more suspicious than me.
0.5;He seemed nervous and had been behaving \Noddly since he entered the café.
0.5;What you did after the manager \Nwent to the bathroom.
0.5;Come to think of it, we \Nheard the donuts frying.
0.5;but by the time I entered, the \Nmanager was already on the ground.
0.5;In other words, you're the \Nonly one who left his seat
0.5;to go to the bathroom when \Nthe crime took place.
0.5;I'm sorry, but we'd like \Nyou to wait elsewhere.
0.5;Based on the circumstances \Nand testimony so far,
0.5;Inspector Megure, we finished \Nquestioning the suspects.
0.5;First, sales have declined at the \Ncafé Nonaka-san operates recently.
0.5;At this rate, he's not sure if his café \Nwill survive beyond a few more months.
0.5;Next, Furukawa-san said he had money \Nproblems with the manager Tomita-san in the past.
0.5;They both seem \Nto have motives.
0.5;Finally, the part-time employee Sakai-san \Ndidn't get along with the manager very well.
0.5;the gloves left at the crime \Nscene belong to Nonaka-san.
0.5;The gloves of the only man without \Nan alibi were at the crime scene.
0.5;Th-They're certainly mine,\Nbut I lost them a while ago.
0.5;You don't have an alibi, you do have a \Nmotive, and then there's this material evidence.
0.5;Nonaka-san, could you \Naccompany us to the station?
0.5;Inspector Megure, could you \Nwait to escort him away?
0.5;all the evidence in this case seems to \Nindicate that Nonaka-san is the culprit.
0.5;In other words, if Nonaka-san \Nreally did do it,
0.5;If it were me, I wouldn't \Nhave left the gloves behind.
0.5;You said you were in the \Nkitchen the whole time,
0.5;I was frying donuts in the \Nkitchen the whole time.
0.5;who was already in the \Nbathroom, with a nearby mop.
0.5;It's a very natural and \Nplausible series of events.
0.5;Let's see. Furukawa-san was \Nin his seat the whole time.
0.5;For him to attack Tomita-san \Nin the bathroom...
0.5;It wouldn't have been possible for \Nhim to do it without us noticing.
0.5;Could you follow Sonoko-neechan's \Ninstructions?
0.5;There's only one route Sakai-san, \Nwho was in the kitchen,
0.5;could have taken to reach the \Ncrime scene in the bathroom
0.5;crossed the yard, entered \Nthrough the front entrance,
0.5;He followed the same route \Nto return to the kitchen.
0.5;That's the route you want \Nme to recreate, right?
0.5;That sound we heard... \Nwas the timer in the kitchen.
0.5;You said you were in the kitchen frying \Ndonuts when the crime took place,
0.5;but you could have gone anywhere \Nduring the three minutes
0.5;But, why were Nonaka-san's \Ngloves in the bathroom?
0.5;If you assume Sakai-san set everything \Nup, doesn't that explain it?
0.5;Your leading statements made me \Nsuspicious of you from the start.
0.5;No one could pass through \Nhere without being seen.
0.5;You're able to pass through \Nthis area without being seen.
0.5;You did in fact pass through this \Nyard and return to the kitchen
0.5;Oh, the evidence has been standing \Nin front of us this whole time.
0.5;Making it the same color as your uniform \Nmust've required a lot of patience.
0.5;wouldn't someone notice if \Nhe passed through the yard?
0.5;but since everyone was focused \Non their tea and donuts,
0.5;and how he could cross the yard \Nunnoticed when he set it up.
0.5;Detective Chiba said this cloth \Nwas stuck to a nail outside.
0.5;I'm sure they'll find that \Nit came from your uniform.
0.5;Apparently forensics reported that they \Nfound the laxatives you gave Nonaka-san
0.5;so he'd go to the bathroom \Nin the water on his table.
0.5;You began frying new ones when \Nno new customers had entered.
0.5;I came up with the menu, the \Nconcept, and the eye-catching yard.
0.5;What? Furukawa-san, you were \Ngoing to dine and dash?
0.5;Because Furukawa-san unconsciously \Ntouched his wallet in his back pocket
0.5;Furukawa-san, could you \Ntell us more about that?
0.5;That's why he was acting \Nnervous the whole time.
0.5;And after eating sweets, \Nyou need something salty.
0.5;What about low sugar and \Nlow—well, whatever.
0.5;I expect you to fulfill the \Nthree demands I'm about to list.

0.5;and set the gears of tragedy \Nin motion for the Oide family?
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!

0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;If this case was the premeditated \Nmurder of Oide Raita,
0.5;that would make what Taira \Nsaid rather curious.
0.5;I haven't figured anything out, so I'm \Ngoing back to the Oide family home.
0.5;Inspiration will surely strike \Nif we go to the crime scene,
0.5;the same way we figured out \NTaira Yasushi was the burglar.
0.5;So, why are we taking the train \Ninstead of a rental car today?
0.5;Because today, taking public \Ntransportation is good luck.
0.5;Wait, is this what he was \Nreading so intently earlier?
0.5;If we'd taken the train yesterday, \Nwe might've solved the case already.
0.5;I see. In that case, my \Nsister went to the hospital.
0.5;My father was worried that I couldn't \Nfind a job until the very end.
0.5;I thought doing whatever it takes to get one \Nwould be a good way to honor his memory.
0.5;They're closed today, but I asked \Nthem to make some time for me.
0.5;I'm sure they'll understand if you \Nexplain your feelings to them.
0.5;All that's left is to \Nfind my father's killer.
0.5;Leave it all to me, the great detective Mori \NKogoro, to handle the case.
0.5;When Taira snuck into the \Nhouse to steal the money,
0.5;Oide Raita-san was sleeping on \Nthe floor around here, right?
0.5;They have a sofa, so why was \Nhe sleeping on the hard floor?
0.5;He was probably overcome \Nby extreme sleepiness.
0.5;When I've had a lot to drink, I end \Nup sleeping wherever when I come home.
0.5;But Raita-san was looking for Fusaya-san \Nthat day, so that couldn't have been it.
0.5;In that case, he must've \Nbeen really tired or...
0.5;secretly drugged Raita with sleeping \Npills before Taira snuck into the house.
0.5;After confirming they'd taken \Neffect, they tried to kill him.
0.5;After watching Taira burglarize \Nand flee the house,
0.5;In that case, why did the culprit \Nbother putting him to sleep?
0.5;Sounds like he's zeroed \Nin on the culprit again.
0.5;Did Raita mention having \Nproblems with anyone?
0.5;She's around your age, wears sunglasses, \Nand has a mole right here.
0.5;When I ran into her the other day, \NI told her I'd gotten engaged.
0.5;Raita-san was in the living room angry about \NFusaya-san running away from home, right?
0.5;He was at the bottom of the \Nstairs just inside the entrance.
0.5;Dad was really angry while \Nhe was fixing the shelf.
0.5;Since his voice was so indistinct, I \Nthought it must have really gotten to him.
0.5;She was engaged to the \Nson of a wealthy family.
0.5;and secretly drugged Raita using sleeping \Npills you procured from your workplace.
0.5;was due to the sleeping pills \Nhe was given taking effect.
0.5;They successfully put \Nhim to sleep as planned,
0.5;I can't believe I got injured after \Ngetting caught up in that accident.
0.5;Your injuries may not have been \Nserious, but it's still a concussion.
0.5;I think she got what she \Ndeserved with this case.
0.5;When you started showing up \Neverywhere I went, I laughed.
0.5;I thought they must really be struggling \Nif they hired a famous detective.
0.5;I haven't fallen so low that I'd commit \Nmurder over something like that.
0.5;Then why did you keep showing up \Nwherever that family went yesterday?
0.5;Is watching them from a distance \Nand pretending to visit them
0.5;It's certainly true that \Nyou're behaving suspiciously.
0.5;Don't treat me like a criminal when \Nyou don't even have any evidence.
0.5;I'll give you some special information \Nif you'll leave me alone.
0.5;on the day of the incident \Nwhen the 4:30 PM notice played.
0.5;A short man wearing a hat with \Nshaggy hair and a prominent nose.
0.5;I think all he had with him \Nwas a small shoulder bag.
0.5;Which means Taira didn't \Ntake the weapon with him.
0.5;Good luck finding the real \Nculprit, Mr. Great Detective.
0.5;If it was Mori-san's request, \Nthen I suppose I can show you.
0.5;But will you understand \Nwhat you're looking at?
0.5;I'll tell him exactly \Nwhat I saw. Don't worry.
0.5;The person who set the gears of tragedy \Nin motion for the Oide family was...
0.5;The gears of tragedy will \Nfinally stop turning now.
0.5;There's no harm in praying to god \Nor asking great detectives for help.
0.5;I see. Speaking of evidence, they didn't \Nfind any sleeping pills in Raita-san's body.
0.5;You truly are the country's \Ngreatest detective.
0.5;The culprit thought to have snuck into \Nthis house and killed your father
0.5;Before I explain the truth, I'd like \Nto confirm something with you first.
0.5;The morning of the incident, Raita returned \Njust as you were leaving the house
0.5;in order to avoid troubling \Nyour sister and her fiancee.
0.5;He returned to speak with you about your \Nfuture, but the two of you got into a fight.
0.5;That's right. Why are you \Nbringing that up now?
0.5;Was your fight with your \Nfather rather intense?
0.5;Yeah. Dad was really angry \Nwhile he was fixing the shelf.
0.5;Your sister was referring to \Nthe hanging shelf up there.
0.5;And your fight was violent \Nenough that it broke.
0.5;His back struck the wall, \Ncausing the shelf to fall.
0.5;Dead. You've heard the cause \Nof death, haven't you?
0.5;Often the moment a person strikes their \Nhead and their time of death don't match.
0.5;People who strike their head and \Nfall unconscious due to a concussion
0.5;often recover quickly and appear totally \Nlucid as though nothing happened.
0.5;You're saying that's what \Nhappened to my father?
0.5;Why don't you show a little more \Nconsideration for your family?
0.5;The hanging shelf fell, and its \Ncorner struck Raita on the head.
0.5;Raita probably lost \Nconsciousness for a moment,
0.5;but eventually he was overcome by \Nfatigue as he lost consciousness.
0.5;Unaware that a burglar \Nhad entered his home...
0.5;Please be careful as you \Nreturn to your homes.
0.5;There could be a true culprit who \Nsnuck in after that burglar fled
0.5;There were no wounds on Raita's head aside \Nfrom the one caused by the fatal blow.
0.5;I prayed at this shrine yesterday \Nevening and this morning, too,
0.5;Now we can finally begin \Npreparing for your wedding.

0.5;The Detective Boys and Ran came to tour a \Nstudio run by an acquaintance of the professor.
0.5;I hope we get to see the \Ncompleted Talos soon!
0.5;Your sense of professional self-satisfaction \Nwon't fix the problem.
0.5;Whether we live or die \Nis a matter of business.
0.5;I wracked my brain because I \Nunderstood your daughter's suffering.
0.5;Because of your cowardice, Yamagata-san \Nwill never be able to show off his talents.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Judging by the wound on his head, it's \Nhard to imagine this was an accident.
0.5;We've already called an \Nambulance. More importantly...
0.5;It's likely the culprit \Nis still lurking nearby.
0.5;We didn't find any suspicious \Npersons inside the dome,
0.5;just figures and models that \Nfell when the power went out.
0.5;Could they have entered \Nthrough a window or vent?
0.5;We're checking the security \Ncamera footage right now,
0.5;So the culprit took advantage \Nof the opportunity to escape.
0.5;But we ran here as soon \Nas we heard him scream.
0.5;Either way, this had to be the work of \Nsomeone intimately familiar with the facility.
0.5;It's natural to assume the culprit \Nused the situation created
0.5;by the loss of power and falling \Nmodels to hit Hanyu-san,
0.5;but that wouldn't have given \Nthem enough time to flee.
0.5;We're known domestically and internationally \Nfor our products with originality.
0.5;It would be wise to have our \Nsecurity guards look into it.
0.5;That's it. The culprit must've \Nentered through there.
0.5;You're right. It doesn't \Nlook like it was moved.
0.5;This and the security camera \Nfootage eliminates the possibility
0.5;that a suspicious person entered \Nthrough the main or service entrance.
0.5;Just before the crime, we were \Nsaying hello to Yamagata-san.
0.5;How many remotes are there that \Ncontrol the dome's facilities?
0.5;Yamagata and the tour guide \NShinobu each have one.
0.5;Yamagata-san, do you have your \Nremote with you right now?
0.5;Can you differentiate it \Nfrom the other remote?
0.5;We'll start by asking \Neveryone for their alibi.
0.5;I'd just concluded a deal over the phone \Nand was preparing to leave in my office.
0.5;What I'm wondering is why Hanyu-san \Nwas on the observation deck.
0.5;Why was it necessary to \Nshut off power to the dome?
0.5;and we heard the models fall \Nafter Hanyu-san's scream.
0.5;Since the lights came back \Non immediately afterwards
0.5;Which means he should have \Ndropped it around here.
0.5;Hanyu-san used it to shut off \Nthe power while standing there.
0.5;Which means Hanyu-san chose \Nto shut off the power.
0.5;We searched pretty thoroughly, \Nbut we didn't find the remote.
0.5;they didn't have time to leave \Nwithout being spotted by us.
0.5;Ayumi-chan, you took a picture \Nof the floating boat, right?
0.5;This is the last place we saw the \Nfloating boat during the tour.
0.5;Come to think of it, \Nwhile I was on the phone,
0.5;Or maybe the culprit had \Nalready snuck in by then.
0.5;that anyone entered or left the \Nstudio around the time of the crime.
0.5;This man's ideas alone are a treasure \Ntrove for anyone in this industry.
0.5;It's my job as well as Hanyu-kun's \Nto complain about you.
0.5;There are plenty of places for the culprit \Nto hide, like offices and storage rooms.
0.5;If they came for our industry secrets, then \Nwhile they were looking for treasure...
0.5;You're crying too much to understand. \NPull yourself together.
0.5;When he wakes up, the first thing \Nhe'll want to see is you looking well.
0.5;Professor, there's one more \Nthing I want to confirm.
0.5;Professor, he said something \Nabout the remote.
0.5;There are two remotes that \Ncontrol the dome's facilities.
0.5;The power came back on immediately \Nafter it was shut off, but...
0.5;in a different position from the \None it was in before the attack.
0.5;This was the floating boat's \Nfinal position during our tour,
0.5;Or maybe Hanyu-san had a \Nremote during the attack.
0.5;As the last to arrive, wouldn't you have \Nhad the opportunity to retrieve the remote
0.5;while we were distracted by \Ndiscovering the injured Hanyu-san?
0.5;Yamagata-san, aren't you the one who overheard\Nmy conversation with Kagami in his office?
0.5;Doesn't this studio exist because \Nof Yamagata-san's talent?
0.5;My company's been in the red \Nsince his father worked here.
0.5;You'll see something incredible \Nwhen the power goes out.
0.5;This studio will become \NFranklin's Japanese branch.
0.5;but the studio will continue operating under \Nthe name Yamagata Room on a trial basis.
0.5;The hospital director said \Nhe's fine and not to worry.
0.5;Don't worry, Shinobu-san. \NThe case has been solved.
0.5;I'm sure someday the giant's \Nentire body will be completed.

0.5;His works have dropped in number,\Nand he's stuck in a standstill.
0.5;That's what you get for\Nalways copying our master!
0.5;The Kikuemon name has been\Npassed down from master to pupil.
0.5;Anyway, tell us what kind\Nof pottery Detective Mori chose!
0.5;Hold your horses!\NI still haven't told him!
0.5;Well, make your choice.\NAny of the ones in this room.
0.5;They're all masterpieces,\Nworth millions of yen each!
0.5;Hold on, Dad. This is too generous.\NShow some restraint, okay?
0.5;Just as I'd expect from a great\Ndetective! You have sharp eyes!
0.5;We all bet on\Nwhat you would choose.
0.5;And, just as I expected\Nyou would, you chose that cup,
0.5;which is hailed the\Nworld over as a masterware!
0.5;I never intended to give that away,\Nbut I don't mind in your case!
0.5;Oh, yes. I'd also like Mori-san to\Nsee the Fusui-maru, my latest work.
0.5;Oh, come to think of it,\NI don't see Otani-kun...
0.5;Hmm. If it had a price, it'd maybe\Ngo for about 10 million yen?
0.5;You're such a joker!\NYou already knew that!
0.5;The remains of pottery that the\Nlady of the house demolished.
0.5;Yes. Despite how she seems,\Nshe has a very sharp eye.
0.5;So, our master won't look at anything\Nthat doesn't meet her standards.
0.5;After all, she has the eyes that my son,\Nwho was to be my successor,
0.5;That's why I've left\Nher in charge of deciding
0.5;who will succeed the\NKikuemon name after I die.
0.5;You have it good! She only okayed\Ntwo of my wares this month!
0.5;She hasn't okayed one\Nof mine in three months...
0.5;Any pottery made with such\Nfeelings will also be bent out of shape.
0.5;Calm your mind like the water\Nof a still lake, and it will naturally--
0.5;I-I'm so sorry! It tumbled down\Nwhen I went to climb the ladder!
0.5;The Fusui-maru has\Nsimply returned to the earth.
0.5;Masuko-san, you can start\Non the nice meal for Mori-san.
0.5;I'm a tad exhausted.\NPlease don't wake me until dinner.
0.5;"This must be Otani's\N""everything gets broken"" curse!"
0.5;Oh, we'll clean up here.\NYou can relax in the living room.
0.5;I haven't had enough to drink!\NKeep it coming!
0.5;Yes, her personality\Nchanges whenever she drinks!
0.5;But, is it really okay to\Naccept something so valuable?
0.5;He isn't long for this world, anyway!\NHe can't make much anymore!
0.5;I can only make two or\Nthree decent things a year now.
0.5;Huh? I seem to recall you\Nexhibited ten or so items last year...
0.5;Never mind pottery! Let's hear\Nabout some more of your cases!
0.5;Then tell us about\Nthe Tsukikage Island case!
0.5;Then how about the incident that\Nhappened during my class reunion?
0.5;And the art museum\None and magician one!
0.5;Those were the only three that\Nyou actually solved while conscious...
0.5;Umm, you'll catch\Ncold if you sleep here...
0.5;It's no use. She's not easily\Nwoken once she falls asleep drunk.
0.5;After that, the party\Ncontinued late into the night.
0.5;The seven people in the\Nstateroom forgot all their worries,
0.5;Little did we know that a horrible\Nincident we'd never forget
0.5;would be waiting for\Nus in a few hours' time...
0.5;I hate to ask, but could\N you go wake Masuko-san?
0.5;Maybe she went to buy\Nsome things for breakfast?
0.5;Should we give her a call?\NShe did have a cell phone with her...
0.5;I can't have anything too\Nheavy first thing in the morning.
0.5;Hey, now! Don't tell me someone's\Ninside the storeroom?!
0.5;She hanged herself just now!\NShe might survive if we get her down!
0.5;I'll get her legs!\NOtani, hold her steady!
0.5;The wife of the son of Kikuemon-san,\Nthe head of this house...
0.5;And you were all in the stateroom\Nwhen you heard something break?
0.5;Y-Yes. We had partied\Nlate into the night yesterday.
0.5;She went to sleep first,\Nso I carried her to her room.
0.5;Her futon was empty when\NI went to wake her this morning.
0.5;Just before we went to look\Nfor her, we heard something break,
0.5;The sound was of the pottery\Nthat's lying in pieces on the floor.
0.5;She had probably stood\Non it when hanging herself.
0.5;That little boy said she might\Nlive if we brought her down quickly...
0.5;And, soundly asleep as always\Ndespite just happening to be present...
0.5;P-Please don't shout. I have\Na hangover and my head is killing me...
0.5;Every place you go, there's a\Npile of dead bodies! Do you get it?!
0.5;Inspector. There are no signs\Nthat anyone climbed onto the beams.
0.5;"That ladder doesn't\Nreach to the roof beams, either;"
0.5;something must've been tied to\Nthe end of the rope and thrown over.
0.5;And there seem to be plenty\Nof things to tie to it here...
0.5;The shelves don't hold just\Nthe master's work, but ours as well.
0.5;If she had used anything,\Nit probably would've been ours.
0.5;There seems to have\Nbeen quite a lot of blood, too.
0.5;She probably messed up\Nand fell to the floor the first time.
0.5;When she did, she cut\Nher leg on a piece of the pot
0.5;It's not uncommon for a noose\Nto be so big that the head slips out,
0.5;But I'm pretty sure we\Nonly heard one pot break...
0.5;Then her first attempt must've\Nbeen while you were still asleep.
0.5;If the rope had come untied,\Nit would've taken too long to fix it.
0.5;She was drinking so\Nhappily just last night...
0.5;She most likely did this out of\Nregret for breaking the Fusui-maru.
0.5;The master's latest pot, which was\Nto be put on exhibition soon.
0.5;If she had been\Ndeeply troubled by it, then...
0.5;Yes, she had the motive and\Ncircumstances for this to be a suicide.
0.5;Please compare the cut with\Nthe shapes of the broken pieces.
0.5;But the pieces have\Nbeen trampled quite a lot,
0.5;A match would make\Nthis question go away, but...
0.5;What's with you? You aren't\Nwearing anything on your feet...
0.5;I can't help it! I rushed here!\NThat lady's the same way!
0.5;Come to think of it,\NI don't see her footwear anywhere...
0.5;If she came barefoot, the bottoms\Nof her feet should be dirty like mine.
0.5;Oh! Then maybe\Nsomeone carried her here?
0.5;If so, then that places\Nthe suspicion on all of you,
0.5;as you were in the nearby stateroom\Njust before the body was found!
0.5;I finally found a trace\Nthat the killer failed to hide!
0.5;Using this method, you wouldn't\Nneed to be in the room to kill her!
0.5;Evidence that the killer\Nfailed to hide completely!
0.5;we ended up going to Sera's regular \Nramen spot on the way home from school.
0.5;Each of these unusual customers used \Nlarge quantities of vinegar, soy sauce,
0.5;According to officers Miyamoto \NYumi and Miike Naeko,
0.5;who arrived as the three \Nof them were leaving,
0.5;they were suspects in the robbery \Nmurder case that happened in the area.
0.5;A week ago while Yumi-san and \NI were patrolling the area...
0.5;There was a get together at \Nthe shopping center that day,
0.5;so most of the shops had their lights \Noff, and there weren't many passers-by.
0.5;"The only place open was this \N""Ramen to Die For Ramen Ogura."""
0.5;Then wouldn't the last customer to \Nrush into the shop be the culprit?
0.5;Actually, just like today, the three of \Nthem arrived at roughly the same time.
0.5;Apparently, she tripped \Nwhile chasing the culprit.
0.5;they were swinging the hose around in \Nthe entryway of the victim's house.
0.5;there was another customer here \Naround the time of the incident...
0.5;With brilliant detective \Nskills, its color is changed!
0.5;Who is the culprit who swung \Nthe hose around their head?
0.5;Yeah, because about a minute \Nbefore the three of them arrived,
0.5;If her boyfriend left just before \Nthe culprit entered the shop,
0.5;This is while you were \Npursuing the culprit, right?
0.5;in the hose the culprit \Nthrew at me and I tripped.
0.5;But it was dark. I only heard their \Nfootsteps and saw a silhouette.
0.5;Also, it looked like they threw \Naway some kind of packing tape.
0.5;In any case, the area's \Ndangerous. You should go home.
0.5;No wonder you took so long even \Nthough all you did was trip.
0.5;He was breathing normally, \Nso I knew he wasn't the culprit.
0.5;I didn't want to get him \Ninvolved in the case.
0.5;Yeah, but just because he \Nwas breathing normally...
0.5;I'm not sure a police officer \Nshould've let him go
0.5;But if he was eating ramen here \Nuntil just before the incident,
0.5;Maybe he'll know who did it after \Nhearing about it over the phone.
0.5;You're on the phone with someone \Nimportant, so call you back?
0.5;Their conversations are \Nweirdly synchronized...
0.5;They made a weird click-click \Nsound with every step they took?
0.5;Hey. When you searched the shop, \Ndid you check the bathroom?
0.5;We glanced inside, but we didn't see \Nanything that looked like jewelry.
0.5;So that's why the culprit \Nwas swinging the hose.
0.5;And if they're still coming \Nhere, that means...
0.5;Could I get one order each of pot \Nstickers, shumai, spring rolls,
0.5;He used to be all about the \NJudge of the Afterlife ramen.
0.5;But if that's the case, \Nwhy did you sit there?
0.5;Don't you eat pot stickers, shumai, \Nand spring rolls with soy sauce?
0.5;And you used a different soy sauce \Ncontainer when yours ran out.
0.5;And there was nobody else \Nhere until we arrived.
0.5;Just because he's ordering \Ndishes that require soy sauce,
0.5;It's just a coincidence \Nthat you sat there, right?
0.5;There's no prize at the bottom \Nof a soy sauce container.
0.5;Boss, could I get a large \NJudge of the Afterlife ramen,
0.5;Satoko-san, if you eat \Nthat much, you'll get fat.
0.5;I'm planning on getting a \Nlot of exercise tonight.
0.5;A woman who returned home \Nto get something she forgot
0.5;He kept swinging around \Na two meter long hose.
0.5;Hey, did that hose the \Nculprit was swinging around
0.5;there were signs that packing tape had \Nbeen attached to one end of the hose.
0.5;If the object taped to the end of the \Nhose were a breathable piece of cloth,
0.5;The centrifugal force forces \Nthe air inside the hose out,
0.5;and an amount equal to the air forced \Nout is sucked in through the other end.
0.5;I saw it performed in an \Nexperiment on TV the other day.
0.5;But what could he have used \Nfor the breathable fabric?
0.5;Apparently the hose \Nbelonged to the homeowner,
0.5;so it must've either been \Nsomething at the house,
0.5;But the texture of a handkerchief would \Nbe too fine to serve as a filter.
0.5;that allows air through but \Ndoesn't have large holes?
0.5;But what did he need to vacuum \Nup before running away?
0.5;The policewoman who told \Nme about the case
0.5;said a guy who passed by the \Nculprit heard a weird noise.
0.5;Maybe something was stuck \Nto one of his shoes.
0.5;Maybe he accidentally stepped \Non something hard and sharp
0.5;The lenses would break \Nif you stepped on them.
0.5;The culprit must've dropped his \Nglasses and stepped on them
0.5;That's why he collected the \Nshards of the broken lenses
0.5;The only people who carry cases are ones who \Nhave separate pairs for near and far sight,
0.5;New glasses are always \Nstrong and make you dizzy,
0.5;so some people carry around an old pair \Nuntil they get used to the new ones.
0.5;Come to think of it, what \Nhappened to your new glasses?
0.5;the day the lady who was killed \Ntried to pick a fight with you?
0.5;The police even investigated \Nthe bathroom drain.
0.5;I'm sure the police will find \Nit if we tell them about this.
0.5;because Japan's police force \Nis so exceptionally talented.
0.5;but if the police searched the \Ndrain, you would've been screwed.
0.5;So you hid them at the \Nbottom of the water tank,
0.5;Lenses are hard to see underwater \Nunless you look really closely.
0.5;they were part of the \Ntoilet and overlook them.
0.5;And at a glance, they wouldn't \Nlook like the stolen jewelry.
0.5;But an examination of the \Nlenses revealed the truth.
0.5;we already found the earrings you \Nhid in the soy sauce container.
0.5;because you lost track of which \Ncontainer they were in, right?
0.5;That's why you kept ordering \Ndishes that used soy sauce.
0.5;And the fingerprints on the \Nearrings we found matched yours.
0.5;MPD Section One Violent Crimes \NDivision Three, Sato Miwako!
0.5;you may have tried to run \Nif we entered the shop.
0.5;It seemed like they were \Nhaving a lot of fun, though.
0.5;And you're the ones who told us \Nabout the truth behind this case.
0.5;She forgot it here when \Nshe came the other day.
0.5;He didn't want to make \Nit obvious that the thief
0.5;who stole the earrings heard \Nabout them at this shop.
0.5;we should get to the station \Nto record his statement.
0.5;And there's still the matter \Nof tonight's exercise.
0.5;If you want a workout, \Nwhy don't you go to the gym?
0.5;It's embroidered right \Nhere on the handkerchief.
0.5;Then this handkerchief \Nbelongs not to Sera Masumi,
0.5;Which means I've met her and \Nheard that name somewhere before.
0.5;Apparently the person who died on the \Nbridge was wearing brown shoes, too.

0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Please! Drop me off at\NOkino Yoko-chan's concert hall!
0.5;You broke your leg and you're\Nin an ambulance, not a taxi!
0.5;How lame! Falling down some\Nsteps and breaking a bone!
0.5;Not to mention the cause\Nwas an Okino Yoko concert!
0.5;You know you shouldn't\Nrush down stairs.
0.5;especially since you only\Ndropped by on your way to play.
0.5;Conan-kun's going to teach\Nus to play soccer in the park!
0.5;Now, now, Mori-san. Does it\Nreally matter if they only dropped by?
0.5;I had lots of visitors when I first\Ncame here, but now I get none.
0.5;You should be happy\Nthat someone came to see you.
0.5;Apparently, he was seriously\Nhurt in a car accident.
0.5;Oh, Yoshio!\NHow rare it is to see you!
0.5;Two weeks in the hospital because\Nof a bad back... how pathetic.
0.5;You know that's no good.\NYou're diabetic, you know.
0.5;O-Oh, Yumiko, she, uhh,\Nyou know, went ice-skating with a friend.
0.5;Oh, that's a shame. It would've\Nbeen nice to see my granddaughter.
0.5;It can't be helped.\NYumiko just loves to play.
0.5;You know, the guys who\Nrobbed your bank last week.
0.5;In that case, why not speak\Nwith Mori Kogoro-san there?
0.5;Oh, but all I did was\Ntremble in fear under a desk...
0.5;Say! Are those the\Nguys from the criminal group
0.5;that stole 100 million yen\Nand still hasn't been caught?!
0.5;That's right. They stole\N100 million in broad daylight,
0.5;They disabled the security in\Nadvance and acted with precision,
0.5;so their crime syndicate must\Nbe quite a large organization.
0.5;L-Like I said, I was under\Nmy desk, shaking, so...
0.5;But the leader must've said to put\Nyour hands up or something, right?
0.5;Oh, Dad. I have things to do,\Nso I should be going.
0.5;Bring a present or something\Nnext time you come!
0.5;We're with the police.\NYou're Sekiguchi Yoshio-san, correct?
0.5;That man in the bed next to\Nyour father was in a car accident.
0.5;My guess is that the robbers\Nprobably escaped overseas in a boat.
0.5;They're hiding out in\Nsome mountains somewhere.
0.5;Nah, they're probably on a shopping\Nspree with their stolen money!
0.5;I doubt they'd immediately\Nuse the money they stole.
0.5;There's still a good chance\Nthe criminal group is nearby.
0.5;A bank [ginko] robber\Ncan only be nearby [kinko].
0.5;What do you think,\NSekiguchi-san?
0.5;It wouldn't be nice to wake him up,\Nso our theory party is over.
0.5;Conan. Okino Yoko-chan's\Non a music show at 3:00,
0.5;Could you get me a\Nwheelchair from downstairs?
0.5;Living the hospital\Nlife isn't all that bad!
0.5;Don't tell me you're gonna\Nwimp out at this point?
0.5;Not to mention there are\Npolice lurking outside the room...
0.5;Forget about the cops.\NI have that taken care of.
0.5;He'll be gone from the room\Nbefore your 3:30 deadline.
0.5;He's gonna watch some idol\NTV show in the lobby at 3:00.
0.5;Those brats are off\Ngetting him a wheelchair.
0.5;B-But I can't do it right\Nin front of my father!
0.5;I'm having lots of\Nfun with a nice lady here!
0.5;Come get me when you're\Ndone talking with the doctor, okay?
0.5;Your chance to do it is before the\Ndoctors make their rounds at 3:30,
0.5;when surveillance isn't\Nso tight. Should be simple.
0.5;B-But I've never killed anyone,\Nor even shot a gun before!
0.5;Whoops! You'll only rouse\Nsuspicion if you shout.
0.5;Listen. Put the gun up to him\Nand pull the trigger. You can't miss.
0.5;You still got time. Freshen up\Nin the john and calm down first.
0.5;Yes. The tire tracks from\Nthe car used in the robbery
0.5;The robbers likely thought\NAkabane was dead and left him behind.
0.5;Just by coincidence,\NAkabane is in Detective Mori's room.
0.5;He broke that leg\Nnot too long ago, too!
0.5;Anyways, I'm heading\Nback to the station.
0.5;When you deem he's fit enough\Nfor questioning, haul him on over.
0.5;T-This is my chance! He's not\Nhere to keep watch over me!
0.5;If I tell the inspector everything\Nhere, he might be able to...
0.5;You heard my partner.\NYou're always under our watch.
0.5;Any more funny business and\Nyou'll be dealt with immediately.
0.5;Oh, it's nothing. He asked if I had\Nany medicine, since he feels ill.
0.5;You should ask\Ndoctors that, not policemen!
0.5;Conan suddenly ran off,\Nso we went looking for him!
0.5;Damn you, Conan!\NYou're gonna get a Cobra Twist later!
0.5;What were you doing?!\NYoko-chan's show is about to start!
0.5;I can't do it. I'm up against a wall.\NNo one'll believe me now.
0.5;3:30 is the deadline. If I don't\Ndo it before then, Yumiko'll be...
0.5;He did say they'd take care\Nof things so I wouldn't be found out,
0.5;You've been asked to\Nkill that Akabane guy, right?
0.5;Using the weapon\Ninside that creampuff box.
0.5;given you're still in the hospital\Nwith a box that can't be a present,
0.5;especially after you said you\Nhad to leave to take care of things.
0.5;Plus, it's forbidden to use\Ncell phones inside hospitals.
0.5;Yet strange men carrying them\Nare lurking around, watching you.
0.5;Your daughter's being held hostage\Natop that department store, right?
0.5;You mumbled her name\Nwhile glancing out the window,
0.5;and someone there is looking\Nthis way through binoculars.
0.5;I got a call to come\Nhere with my daughter
0.5;If you value your daughter's life,\Nyou'll kill Akabane!
0.5;If you wanna hate anyone,\Nhate the man who just happened

0.5;O-Oh no! Three minutes left!\NI have to go!
0.5;Dammit! Doesn't look like Genta\Nand the others'll make it in time!

0.5;"""The plan has failed! I'll contact\Nyou later! Leave the kid and scram!"""

0.5;Aren't you going to\Nteach us to play soccer?!
0.5;What happened\Nto the ball, Conan-kun?

0.5;Anyway, since I'm a high school \Ndetective, he asked me to go instead.
0.5;No, but apparently my \Nbrother quickly took care
0.5;of any incidents or mysteries \Nthat came up during high school.
0.5;The one who received the \Nrequest was my middle brother.
0.5;Things would happen,\Nlike our fathers dying...
0.5;and middle brother was Sera, too, \Nuntil he graduated from high school.
0.5;Wasn't there a red person \Nbehind that tree a second ago?
0.5;It looked like she around \Nthere until a second ago...
0.5;A villa with a bright red \Ndoor and the shadow
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the\Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Are you Sera-kun's little \Nsister and her friends?
0.5;These are my classmates Sonoko \NSuzuki-kun and Ran Mori-kun.
0.5;And this is the kid under \NRan-kun's family's care,
0.5;Conan-kun, you're pretty \Namazing for a little kid.
0.5;to document the strange \Noccurrence at this rental villa.
0.5;Sera's high school detective \Nsister really came?
0.5;Huh? Ninda-kun and Hakuya-kun, \Nyou came together?
0.5;I was looking forward to having \Na high school girl visit,
0.5;We heard Sera's younger sister\Nwas coming with her friends.
0.5;Tamami's hamburgers could \Nbe sold in a restaurant.
0.5;but I got used to it after \Nliving abroad for three years.
0.5;We used to go mountain climbing \Nand camping together.
0.5;most of what we did was\Nduring summer break.
0.5;She was wearing a red \Nraincoat and red boots.
0.5;She was a long-haired woman\Ndressed in red from head to toe...
0.5;I thought it might be the murderer\Nfrom fifteen years ago...
0.5;There was a homicide at another \Nrental villa near this one.
0.5;He secretly went to the rental \Nvilla with his mistress,
0.5;By the time the police heard \Nthe noise and got there,
0.5;until her white raincoat \Nhad turned bright red.
0.5;we came to this rental villa during \Nour high school summer vacation.
0.5;Our other club member Satoko\Nsaid she saw the Red Woman,
0.5;Since it was getting dark, we called \Nthe police and had them look for her.
0.5;They discovered Satoko's body covered\Nin mud and sunk into the quicksand.
0.5;They found her body because Satoko's\Nshoes...were beside the swamp.
0.5;The knife used in the other \Nmurder was found there, too.
0.5;...had been chased by the Red\NWoman hiding in the forest,
0.5;Even after we graduated, \Nwe came here every year
0.5;But about two years ago, \Nstrange things started happening.
0.5;and tons of apples were rolling \Naround inside a room.
0.5;we found red rose petals stuffed \Ninside the hot water heater.
0.5;Once we even had red paint \Nsplashed over the front door.
0.5;Apparently, the owner of the villa \Npainted the rest of the door red.
0.5;Those strange incidents\Nand the red woman
0.5;you saw in the forest were probably \Njust someone playing pranks on us.
0.5;We need to solve the mystery \Nsurrounding the Red Woman.
0.5;No, you should leave the \NRed Woman to the police...
0.5;I'm going to go shopping at \Nthe store a kilometer away.
0.5;now that I get a closer look, \Nthis room is covered in dust.
0.5;I'm sure not many people \Nwant to rent this place.
0.5;I bet it's one of those really \Nloud ones that work really well.
0.5;Oh, it's one of those mail order \Nvacuums you see all the time.
0.5;If Hakuya-san's not here, could \Nhe be cleaning the toilet?
0.5;In that case, why don't we finish \Ncleaning and take the first bath?
0.5;They said they'd take a bath \Nsince they finished cleaning.
0.5;She should be in the bathroom \Nwith Sumika and Sonoko-chan.
0.5;What? Come to think of it, I haven't \Nseen him since after lunch.
0.5;Hakuya could only have been \Nkilled by the Red Woman.
0.5;Evil spirits, demons, \Nwitches, and sorcerers
0.5;The next episode of Conan is “Tragedy \Nof the Red Woman (Evil Spirit)!”
0.5;Invited by the old man, we've \Ncome to Tottori prefecture.
0.5;A kid is tied up and left \Nalone in these sand dunes.
0.5;I don't know why you suddenly \Ndecided to write novels...
0.5;Then this is a plain old \Nsightseeing trip now.
0.5;We'll start by visiting the \Nsand museum just over—
0.5;the mystery of the robbery \Ncan't quite be caught.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;"""The Tottori Sand Dunes Mystery \NTour, Kurayoshi Arc!"""
0.5;You're ripping people off by \Nmaking them pay to see it.
0.5;Who do you and your pervy \Nmustache think you are?
0.5;It looked like she was \Npicking a fight on purpose.
0.5;How can they build these \Nridiculous things out of sand?
0.5;After putting them on display for a year, \Nthey tear them down and build something else.
0.5;Maybe their transitoriness is \Nmeant to be part of their appeal.
0.5;Tottori is known for its pears \Nand leeks, but most of all...
0.5;There's a place nearby\Ncalled the Kanikkokan.
0.5;It's takes about thirty minutes to \Nget there on the limited express.
0.5;The Edo and Meiji Era \Nwarehouses are this way.
0.5;We worked together once\Non a robbery investigation.
0.5;You can't even properly \Nwatch the house by yourself?
0.5;I happened to be nearby with \Nmy daughter and the boy.
0.5;He helps me with my business, \Nbut he's completely unreliable.
0.5;He's an idiot who wastes \Nall his time goofing off.
0.5;And with Soichi-san's wife Shuko-san \Nand Kazuma-kun, there's six of you.
0.5;Around one, after putting Kazuma to bed \Nand returning to this room, suddenly...
0.5;The robber only wanted the incense \Nburner from the beginning.
0.5;There was no need for \Nhim to tie up Shuko-san.
0.5;So why did he go to the \Ntrouble of tying you up?
0.5;There's no way to know what \Nthe robber was thinking.
0.5;According to forensics, neither the \Nfront nor back door were forced open.
0.5;The robber may have entered \Nusing a spare key.
0.5;Shuko-san said it wasn't there \Nwhen she cleaned this morning.
0.5;Father, wasn't Naomi-san wearing \Nthat pendant yesterday?
0.5;Yesterday, she arrived suddenly \Nfrom Tokyo asking for money.
0.5;That unfortunate woman ran off \Nwith our money when she quit!
0.5;It wasn't much, so we didn't \Nsubmit a damage report.
0.5;So she stole our heirloom to get back \Nat us for not lending her the money.
0.5;She could have made a spare \Nkey while she worked here.
0.5;In the first place, it's your \Nfault for making things up.
0.5;She's a wicked and violent \Nwoman, but she has an alibi.
0.5;"""If you want your heirloom incense \Nburner back, prepare 100 million yen."""
0.5;Its commercial value is \Nno more than 100,000.
0.5;But its the symbol of the Kumado family head\Nthat's been passed down for generations.
0.5;I'd like to ask what you were all \Ndoing and where you were around 1 PM.
0.5;It may not be worth much, but you \Ncan demand a lot of money for it.
0.5;And more damning than anything \Nis that mysterious pendant.
0.5;After Senda Naomi-san dropped it \Nyesterday, the robber picked it up.
0.5;and left the pendant behind to make \Nit look like Senda Naomi-san did it.
0.5;Nor you. I'm sure you want \Nmoney to fool around.
0.5;If we're talking about not having \Nthe money to do what we want,
0.5;And what right does a detective \Nhave to meddle in my affairs?
0.5;Your situation is the same \Nas that of these three.
0.5;You're the reason we're \Nbeing suspected over money!
0.5;Her job as a bride ended when \NI received my heir Kazuma.
0.5;If the alternative is being \Ntorn away from Kazuma,
0.5;I have to continue staying \Nwith the Kumado family.
0.5;and give Shuko-san some \Nrelief from their criticism.
0.5;The head of the family came to Daigakuin \NTemple around noon yesterday.
0.5;who served as inspiration for \N Nanso Satomi Hakkenden.
0.5;Every year he offers his services for the \Nassociated festival, so he came to chat.
0.5;She entered around eleven \Nand left around three.
0.5;Then like she said, around one \Nshe was somewhere in the park.
0.5;Assuming she was here the whole \Ntime between eleven and three.
0.5;The second son Junji-san \Nwasn't lying when he said
0.5;he'd been staying here at Kaike Hot \NSpring since the previous night.
0.5;He said he stayed around here \Nand that he had witnesses.
0.5;So their alibis are missing \Na chunk in the middle.
0.5;Yeah. Neither one had a \Nwitness for one o'clock,
0.5;so it's possible that they went home once \Nbefore returning to where they were.
0.5;As a local influential figure, \Nhe visited places here and there,
0.5;He could have gone home \Nanytime if he wanted to.
0.5;That just leaves Shuko-san's\Nhusband, Soichi-san.
0.5;Yes. Soichi stopped by because he was \Nin the area around one yesterday.
0.5;It would be painful if the \Nrobber were her husband.
0.5;Yesterday at one we were eating \Nnoodles together, Tanaka-chan.
0.5;but I don't have any witnesses \Nto back up my alibi.
0.5;The doctor who unfortunately died in\NSouth Africa at the beginning of the month,
0.5;Dr. Kotani, who was from Tottori, graduated \Nfrom Toto University Medical School...
0.5;He's the doctor who had been practicing \Nmedicine there for a long time.
0.5;I'll show you the hell that awaits \Npeople who try to frame someone else.
0.5;Is that woman really not \Ninvolved in the case?
0.5;When I woke up this morning, \Nit was in front of the entryway.
0.5;Why did the robber return the incense \Nburner without receiving any money?
0.5;Now that this is back, it doesn't \Nmatter who the robber is.
0.5;I wonder why the robber \Nreturned the incense burner.

0.5;So this is what it's\Nlike above the stage!
0.5;You shouldn't be up here!\NIt's dangerous!

0.5;I hope so. I'll never hear the\Nend of it if he beats me again.
0.5;I suppose I'll just\Nsit here and watch...

0.5;Ridiculous. I had\Nno reason to kill Shoko.
0.5;Not true. You two\Nused to be an item.

0.5;Watch. I'll prove\Nif there's poison or not.

0.5;Wrapped around it is the\Nfishing line used in the murder.
0.5;At the end of it is a weight.\NCheck it and you should find cyanide.
0.5;The killer lowered the\Npoisoned weight past the star,
0.5;put it inside the glass,\Nthen pulled it back up.

0.5;One could pull this off\Nwithout being up above.
0.5;Isn't the location of the\Nvictim's glass predetermined?
0.5;One could do this from backstage\Nby extending the line below.
0.5;However, the line caught on\Nthe star's cord when pulled in.
0.5;We will find out by\Nexamining their hands!
0.5;Bah. You gonna read our\Npalms to find the killer?
0.5;The guilty party will be\Nunable to show their hands!
0.5;Sasaki Hitomi-san. What's wrong?\NPlease show us your hands.
0.5;Yes. They're from forcefully\Npulling the fishing line.
0.5;After the incident,\NMori ordered everyone to stay put.
0.5;The fishing line you used\Nshould still be in your pocket.
0.5;Is it because\NI dumped you for Shoko?
0.5;I accepted the fact\Nthat you chose her over me.
0.5;You can have him back.\NWhy not make up with him?
0.5;She just wanted\Nto steal you from me!
0.5;I heard the rumors,\Nbut that 'Sleeping Kogoro logic'

0.5;And you're even as\Nshameless as he is!

0.5;"Detective Conan Episode 984 ""Kid vs. \NKomei: The Targeted Lips (Part Two)"""
0.5;Hattori and I came to Suzuki \NJirokichi's Suzuki Museum.
0.5;Also there to take on Kid was \NInspector Morofushi Takaaki
0.5;Apply miraculous detective skills \Nto the secrets of the heart!
0.5;Where will the missing jewel \Nand their love end up?
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;It's an art that involves drilling \Nholes with an electric drill
0.5;to make it appear as though there \Nare real flowers inside the ice.
0.5;Kid simply used that method to \Ncreate rings instead of flowers,
0.5;with unimaginable speed, \Nin order to throw us off.
0.5;The clear sheet over the ice \Nwas stained black by the ink.
0.5;He could've drilled the holes by \Nslipping inside and turning on a light.
0.5;There are tools next to the \Nice, so that must've been it.
0.5;That would allow him to \Nsecretly drill the holes.
0.5;Since the light couldn't \Nget out, we didn't notice.
0.5;You're going to be stripped \Nand thoroughly searched.
0.5;If someone exits through \Nthose doors with the ring,
0.5;Then wait to search us until \Nafter the alarm has sounded.
0.5;If the alarm goes off,\NI'm arresting both of you.
0.5;I-In any case, this means \Nneither of us are Kid.
0.5;Because of the commotion over Kid, I forgot \Nto get my phone from the glass box.
0.5;But, Inspector, we still don't \Nknow how Kid stole the ring.
0.5;No. Let's abandon the ice since \NKid managed to get around it.
0.5;For now, we should search \Nevery inch of this room
0.5;to determine how he entered \Nand where he went.
0.5;You've been keeping your knees together \Nand crouching this whole time.
0.5;Th-That's right. I'm a \Nlittle cold from the AC.

0.5;he used his medical knowledge \Nto help with the birth

0.5;May I add a touch of color to your \Ngrandmother's cruise through the afterlife?
0.5;What? A package was found \Nin Date-san's locker?
0.5;To be precise, inside the \Npackage sent to Date-san
0.5;was an envelope with a note asking that \Nit be sent to an inspector in Nagano.
0.5;We'd left there it since he passed away \Nin a traffic accident one year ago.
0.5;The writing on the note had bled, \Nso it was pretty hard to read.
0.5;I can't believe it was left in \Nhis locker for a whole year.
0.5;It was stuffed full of things he \Nshould've thrown out like photos
0.5;Sato-san, you don't have good \Nmemories of the police academy?
0.5;Because Date-san and his \Nclass were so unruly,
0.5;they were unbelievably \Nstrict on my class only.
0.5;Why do you only refer to \NMatsuda-san as Matsuda-kun?
0.5;Because unlike Date-san, I became a \Npolice officer before Matsuda-kun.

0.5;Old man Kogoro gets\Nall the credit, though.
0.5;All done! These are my special\NCriminal Pursuit Glasses.
0.5;My father, who works away from home\Nin Tokyo, quit his taxi driver job,

0.5;You're the only one I can\Nturn to now, Detective!
0.5;He has three others\Nnamed Tei, Gou, and Ou.
0.5;But if he had one of these on him,\NI could've found him in no time at all.
0.5;I know! I'll stick it on Ran\Nand test it out!
0.5;My mother died when I was little,\Nso my father is my only family!
0.5;Apparently he didn't\Nsocialize much with other people,
0.5;and he almost never talked about himself,\Naccording to his coworkers.
0.5;Goukai Teiou pulls ahead of the pack\Nto earn his 5th G-1 victory in a row!
0.5;He has three others\Nnamed Tei, Gou, and Ou.
0.5;So he named his cats\Nafter a famous horse!
0.5;I bet you can find him\Nat the race track!
0.5;Yeah, right! Like he'd\Nbe that easy to find!
0.5;Doesn't something seem\Ndifferent about her?
0.5;That case was as easy as pie\Nin the hands of Kogoro Mori!
0.5;We found him after he hanged\Nhimself last night.
0.5;You know, Hirota-san's daughter?\NThe one who came looking for him?
0.5;Oh? So there was\Nsomething going after all?
0.5;He said he'd pay me a full\Nyears' worth of rent all at once
0.5;if I let him have an apartment\Nwith no questions asked.
0.5;Plus all the bills\Nwere brand new and crisp!
0.5;My guess is if his daughter did come over,\Nthen she's probably dead too.
0.5;What do you mean? I thought\NHirota-san committed suicide...
0.5;He was hung from the ceiling\Nafter he was killed.
0.5;Judging from the large hand marks\Non the victim's neck,
0.5;the murderer must have\Nbeen quite a large man.
0.5;These were lying on the floor\Nnear the scene of the crime.
0.5;Her body hasn't turned up yet,\Nbut I'm pretty sure that she's...
0.5;And she just found her father, too!\NHow horrible!
0.5;We still don't know for sure\Nthat she was murdered!
0.5;But now what? If only\Nwe had a clue to go by!
0.5;That's it! I accidentally\Nput the transmitter on her!
0.5;The fact that it's moving means\NMasami-san might still be alive!
0.5;A pachinko parlor?!\NWhat's Masami-san doing here?
0.5;She must really be\Nworried about Masami-san.
0.5;He's been looking\Nup here this whole time.
0.5;Come to think about it,\Nthe killer was a large man!
0.5;Where's Masami-san?\NWhat's happened to her?!
0.5;What great luck! Who'd have thought\Nthe killer would come to us?!
0.5;Actually, I, too, was\Nasked to find Hirota-san.
0.5;That young woman came after me,\Nso I instinctually...
0.5;I wear these sunglasses\Nso people can't make fun of me.
0.5;Get serious!\NMasami-san's life is at stake here!
0.5;So you were asked to locate\NKenzo Hirota-san as well, then?
0.5;Yes. But there was something\Nstrange about his family...
0.5;He said his brother\Nwas his only relative.
0.5;Masami-san was supposed to be\NHirota-san's only relative!
0.5;That's weird, too! Masami-san's father\Ncame here from Yamagata!
0.5;I heard this from the taxi company\Nthat Hirota-san worked at.
0.5;Apparently he would drive\Nthe same route every single evening,
0.5;without bothering to\Npick up any passengers!
0.5;And he would do this\Nat breakneck speeds!
0.5;Akira Hirota. 28 years old. He's a\Nlarge man, over 6 feet 3 inches tall.
0.5;Could he be the large man\Nthe inspector was talking about?
0.5;Tell me! Did you tell this man\Nanything about Hirota-san?!
0.5;And then it was after that\Nthat Hirota-san was murdered.
0.5;So I wondered if there\Nwas any connection...
0.5;There's no mistake! It's the man\NI ran into at the pachinko parlor.
0.5;If he really is the killer,\Nand he was wearing Masami-san's watch...
0.5;Say, do you remember the\Nrobbery from the other day,
0.5;A security guard was killed\Nwhen he recklessly tried to stop them.
0.5;That's what he got\Nfor taking them lightly.
0.5;That's strange! The transmitter\Nhasn't moved at all for a while now!
0.5;He didn't take the watch off\Nand escape, did he?!
0.5;This sweet smell...\Nit's potassium cyanide!
0.5;I see. He couldn't live with\Nwhat he had done so he killed himself!
0.5;Two separate, yet conflicting\Nrequests to find the same person...
0.5;Kenzo Hirota-san acting strange\Nand driving the same route everyday...
0.5;These empty cases are the key\Nto unlocking this mystery!
0.5;But in the context of\Nthe other recent incident,
0.5;They're the three thieves\Nwho stole the one billion in yen!
0.5;they must have been filled\Nwith the stolen money.
0.5;If so, then the reason Hirota-san\Nsped down the same route every day
0.5;Their plan succeeded, but he took\Nall the money for himself and ran.
0.5;and sent separate detectives\Nto locate him.
0.5;And then when he was found,\Nhe was killed.
0.5;Killed by the large man,\Nwho was then killed in this very room.
0.5;Killed by the woman who claimed\Nshe was Hirota-san's daughter.
0.5;Perhaps she was the mastermind\Nbehind these murders!
0.5;but her build and the number\Nof suitcases she had weren't!
0.5;Our dad's gonna be chopped into pieces\Nand buried alive in the mountains
0.5;The reason she seemed different\Nthe second time we saw her
0.5;she was in a hurry and hadn't\Ncompleted her disguise!
0.5;And then Hirota-san's reaction\Nwhen he saw her...
0.5;That wasn't because he was\Nsurprised to see his daughter.
0.5;It was because he was terrified\Nof the partners he betrayed
0.5;Damn it! Why didn't\NI realize it sooner?!
0.5;I'm 100% certain she\Nentered this harbor!
0.5;The sleeping drug you gave me\Nto put him to sleep...
0.5;The instant he drank it, he fell\Nto the ground and stopped moving!
0.5;by throwing all his money\Naround the instant he got it.
0.5;As long as someone that\Ndangerous remained alive,
0.5;You intended to kill everyone\Nfrom the start, didn't you?!
0.5;It isn't here! It's being\Nheld at a certain location.
0.5;After I escape overseas,\NI'll let you know where the money is.
0.5;We can't have that, now. As long as\Nyou're alive, my plan is in jeopardy.
0.5;Once you're dead, all links\Nto me will have vanished.
0.5;I can easily find any number of\Nreplacements for you and the other two.
0.5;Getting my own hands dirty\Ngoes against my principles,
0.5;Kill me and you'll never\Nknow where the money is.
0.5;I have a pretty good idea\Nwhere to find it.
0.5;You did a good job. Allow me to\Nexpress my gratitude by killing you.
0.5;You're the boy from\Nthe detective agency!
0.5;When we first met at the agency,\NI accidentally stuck it on your watch.
0.5;After following the signal, I arrived\Nat the hotel and then ran into you.
0.5;I realized you were leaving\Nwith the billion yen that you stole.
0.5;I had no idea there was\Nanything on the watch.
0.5;But the watch belonged\Nto that big man, right?
0.5;No, he broke his own watch when he\Nlost control and killed Hirota-san,
0.5;so he betrayed us before\Nwe knew what was happening.
0.5;Does that mean this man is the mastermind\Nbehind the billion-yen robbery?
0.5;That's right. Okita scouted for\Npeople he needed to realize his plan.
0.5;He would put these people into teams\Nand have them commit robberies.
0.5;Rumor had it that he would eliminate\Nhis recruits to keep them silent
0.5;I'll tell you where the suitcases\Nwith the one billion yen are!
0.5;When you got in the taxi,\Nyou didn't have the suitcases with you.
0.5;The boss behind\Nthe billion yen robbery!
0.5;Just as she had said, the billion yen\Nwas being kept at the hotel.
0.5;The bill codes matched\Nthose of the stolen money.
0.5;Thus the billion-yen\Nrobbery case came to a close.
0.5;The shot came from the top of\Nthe building across the river!
0.5;What does this coded\Nnumber message say?!
0.5;Take a good look at a regular\Nelectronic calculator.
0.5;Detective Conan Episode 756 “Tragedy \Nof the Red Woman (Revenge)”
0.5;to solve a series of mysteries \Nrelated to the Red Woman.
0.5;However, the body of villa guest \NMasaie Hakuya-san was discovered,
0.5;and Sumika Kawana-san was attacked \Nby a mysterious woman with a knife.
0.5;A refreshing autumn breeze \Nblows through the gaiety
0.5;of summer for a stylish and \Ndashing display of deduction.
0.5;but the mystery of the Red \NWoman is finally revealed.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;I want to ask this high school \Ndetective some questions,
0.5;and Inspector Yamato just called to tell me\Nto bring this boy on any investigations.
0.5;Why isn't Inspector Yamato \Ncoming to this crime scene?
0.5;before tomorrow's Red \NWoman media announcement.
0.5;He's out investigating something \Nwith Inspector Morofushi.
0.5;Those two were stuck on the \NRed Woman case for a while.
0.5;There isn't any moisture or \Nmud left around the window.
0.5;Ninda-san's room on the second floor\N was the same when we inspected it.
0.5;There weren't any wet marks in \Nthe entryway or hallway, either.
0.5;It's possible Sumika-san made up \Nher story about being attacked.
0.5;she cut herself with a knife and\Npretended she was attacked.
0.5;The cut on Sumika-san's back was a \Nsingle clean horizontal cut, right?
0.5;Maybe there really is \Nsomething in the forest...
0.5;It's about the strange incidents that \Npreviously happened at this rental villa.
0.5;You have pictures that were \Ntaken then, don't you?
0.5;And in this incident, a ton of tomatoes \Nwere found floating in the bathtub, right?
0.5;They're all things that \Nremind you of the Red Woman.
0.5;on the afternoon their \Nclassmate went missing.
0.5;The person in the middle is Imoto \NSatoko-san, the girl found in the swamp.
0.5;The ones who found the \Nknife next to the swamp
0.5;were Inspector Yamato \Nand Inspector Morofushi.
0.5;They were still in training\Nat the police academy.
0.5;Since then, they haven't \Nstopped arguing about it.
0.5;Inspector Yamato insists the skeleton \Nfound with the girl isn't the Red Woman's,
0.5;but Inspector Morofushi says it \Nmost likely is the Red Woman.
0.5;I-I call him that because \Nwe're childhood friends.
0.5;Apparently, he went to talk \Nto the now retired policeman,
0.5;currently working at a \Npachinko parlor, who showed up
0.5;After the incident, you thoroughly searched \Nthe forest for the Red Woman, right?
0.5;But three years had passed \Nsince the incident.
0.5;Normally you'd expect the \Nknife to have rusted more.
0.5;The knife was made from a special \Nrust resistant material.
0.5;But you chased after the Red Woman \Nimmediately after she attacked you, right?
0.5;You should've known the Red Woman \Nwas running into quicksand!
0.5;I-I quit the police force \Nbecause it traumatized me.
0.5;The uniformed officer who arrived\Nat the scene of the crime
0.5;was terrified and wrote\Nthe wrong thing down.
0.5;It was about the police report on\Nthe murder fifteen years ago.
0.5;The policeman wrote he was attacked \Nby the Red Woman and she escaped,
0.5;but she actually threw her \Nknife at him and ran away.
0.5;I'm asking if you figured out who put \NHakuya in the tub and attacked Sumika!
0.5;But if you don't know, \Nisn't that what that means?
0.5;B-But you don't know who attacked \NHakuya and Sumika, right?
0.5;No, but I do know who killed \NHakuya-san in the bathroom.
0.5;Isn't that the same person \Nwho attacked Sumika-san?
0.5;when she checked the \Ntemperature of the water.
0.5;When they went to take a bath \Nafter they finished cleaning,
0.5;they found a ton of tomatoes\Nfloating in the tub,
0.5;and Hakuya-san's body in \Nthe bottom of the bath.
0.5;The murder must have occurred while \Nthe three of them were cleaning.
0.5;That means the people who could have \Nkilled Hakuya-san are either Tamami-san,
0.5;who was prepping for dinner \Nin the kitchen, or Ninda-san,
0.5;Didn't you say it was impossible for \Neither of them to commit the crime?
0.5;Sumika-san and the others were cleaning \Nthe first floor where the bathroom is.
0.5;I don't think it would have been possible \Nto kill someone without them noticing.
0.5;Besides, it must've taken more than\None trip to bring enough tomatoes
0.5;to cover the water's surface and the \Ndumbbells that kept the body from floating.
0.5;Then it wasn't possible for the \Nthree of them to commit the crime.
0.5;when Ran-kun and the others went \Nto check the water's temperature,
0.5;then there's one person \Nwho could have done it.
0.5;Before you went to check\Nthe water's temperature,
0.5;We heard the vacuum running and \Nthe nozzle bumping into walls.
0.5;The knocking sound was created by \Nsticking cardboard to Ninda-san's bat,
0.5;hanging it from a column, and \Npointing a rotating fan at the pillar.
0.5;This causes the bat to sway each \Ntime its struck by the wind.
0.5;On its way back, it strikes the column, \Ncreating a regular knocking sound.
0.5;As proof, there were traces of \Nsomething sticky left on the bat,
0.5;Ninda-san's room is directly above the \Nliving room you were cleaning at the time,
0.5;and there was a hook on a pillar \Nin his room for hanging the bat.
0.5;B-But there wasn't a corpse \Nwhen we checked the water...
0.5;Yeah, but there wasn't a single \Ntomato floating in there.
0.5;Sera-no-neechan stole this \Ntomato from the crime scene.
0.5;They sometimes do this in the produce \Nsections at supermarkets, right?
0.5;Unlike normal tomatoes, \Ntomatoes high in sugar sink.
0.5;Maybe the tomatoes had sunk \Nto the bottom of the tub
0.5;If you pour in just enough salt to\Nbarely keep them from floating,
0.5;Increasing the salinity of the \Nwater caused its relative weight
0.5;to exceed that of the high sugar \Ncontent tomatoes, making them float.
0.5;Though she probably used bath \Nsalts to avoid suspicion later.
0.5;Sumika-san pretended to be \Ncleaning the second floor,
0.5;and sneaked up on Hakuya-san \Ncleaning the bathroom.
0.5;she placed dumbbells on him so \Nhe wouldn't float, used bath salts
0.5;to increase the salinity of the water \Nso the tomatoes barely wouldn't float,
0.5;Under the guise of checking \Nthe water's temperature,
0.5;added bath salts to the water, \Nand made the tomatoes float.
0.5;As proof, just like my sleeves when \NI pulled the body from the water,
0.5;They probably got wet when \Nyou first dumped bath salts
0.5;in the water and stirred them \Naround, but it was obvious.
0.5;but you've had them up \Nsince after the incident.
0.5;Everyone else thought \NSera-no-neechan was a boy,
0.5;but you handed her the photos \Nwithout asking her anything.
0.5;That means you knew Sera-no-neechan\Nwas a high school girl detective, right?
0.5;I thought you might be the Red \NWoman we saw in the forest,
0.5;I put on a long-haired wig, a\Nred raincoat and red boots
0.5;When Satoko's body was \Ndiscovered in the swamp,
0.5;I thought Satoko was wearing \Na beige cardigan then.
0.5;Satoko had been playing\Nthe Red Woman, too.
0.5;B-But wasn't it Satoko who said she \Nsaw the Red Woman in the forest?
0.5;she pretended to get separated \Nwhile we were searching,
0.5;and planned to become the \NRed Woman to surprise us.
0.5;If that's true, she must have \Nhad an accomplice for her prank.
0.5;A partner to lead us to Satoko \Ndisguised as the Red Woman.
0.5;That's why I reminded him of the Red \NWoman by scaring him with apples,
0.5;rose petals and paint, but \Nhe wouldn't show himself.
0.5;When I dressed as the Red \NWoman, he finally let it slip.
0.5;He only mistook the\NRed Woman for Satoko
0.5;There's one more person\Nclosely related to the case
0.5;Once you make a mistake, you \Nmust immediately make amends.
0.5;intend to reveal the reporting officer's \Nmistake at the press conference
0.5;on the murder that happened\Nfifteen years ago.
0.5;So please lay down your \Nknife, Shinobu Kagawa-san.
0.5;You're another victim\Nof the Red Woman case.
0.5;She was the mistress of the \Nmurdered company employee?
0.5;but after seeing her beloved \Nbrutally murdered before her eyes,
0.5;the shock and rage probably been \Ndrove her to find an opportunity
0.5;to get revenge on the \NRed Woman for fifteen years.
0.5;Because she was wearing \Nred clothes in the forest,
0.5;Satoko-san probably wasn't \Nat the meeting spot
0.5;It's because I heard about the error in the\Npolice report from fifteen years ago.
0.5;But the knife was found beside \Nthe swamp three years later.
0.5;the only person who could \Nhave taken the knife away
0.5;was the mistress who\Nwitnessed the murder.
0.5;Don't you need to report to your \Nbrother about the incident?
0.5;We can probably find it \Nby following the sound.
0.5;In order for that image to \Ndisplay after receiving a call,
0.5;the phone had to been left \Nshowing that picture.
0.5;Does that mean she showed \Nit to me on purpose?
0.5;All of Japan understands \Nhow you feel, DoDonPa-san.

0.5;ran into a suspicious man being pursued\Nin the rain by men who seemed like cops.
0.5;and I deduced the time and location of his \Ndrug deal from the notebook he dropped.
0.5;"In other words, the code E22 \Nis associated with ""ma,"""
0.5;"Y21 with ""tsuki,"" and \N""G11"" with ""Nihon."""
0.5;I realized immediately that they \Nwere subway and station numbers.
0.5;"and the third character\Nin Azabu Juban is ""ju."""
0.5;If you read the code up to the \Nfifth line following that rule,
0.5;"Y21 is the Yurakucho Line's \NTsukishima, so it's ""tsuki."""
0.5;"M09 is the Marunouchi Line's Shinjuku \NSanchome, so it's ""san."""
0.5;If you read them in order, \Nyou get December 3rd.
0.5;However, the code included \Nmysteries I couldn't decipher,
0.5;and I ended up working with \NHattori Heiji over the phone.
0.5;It's a code using line and\Nstation numbers, huh?
0.5;Hey, some of the codes \Nare aligned to the left,
0.5;Then maybe one side indicates Tokyo stations \Nand the other indicates Osaka stations.
0.5;On an escalator, in Osaka we stand to\Nthe right and leave the left side open,
0.5;but it's the other way \Naround in Tokyo, right?
0.5;The stations aligned to the \Nright are Osaka stations,
0.5;and the ones aligned to the \Nleft are Tokyo stations.
0.5;Maybe he tried to catch the dealer's \Ntrading partner, and instead...
0.5;but there are three people wearing or holding\Nwhite roses while waiting for someone.
0.5;It looks like we'll have to narrow down \Nhis trading partner to one before then.
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;He took something out of his coat's \Ninside pocket and is looking at it.
0.5;The next one is this lady wearing \Na white rose in her hair.
0.5;It's unbelievably expensive, but \Nshe stuck a rose corsage on it.
0.5;The third person is this gaudy guy \Nwearing a white rose on his chest.
0.5;For a while now he's been \Ntalking to some girl...
0.5;That idiot's getting hit on by\Nsome good-for-nothing guy!
0.5;No one's stupid enough to \Nhit on a girl before a deal.
0.5;Could he be one of Kazuha's \Nlaw enforcement acquaintances?
0.5;He's got bleached hair, a pierced \Nnose, and a tattoo on his neck.
0.5;it's got to be either the \Nold dude or the girl.
0.5;If you want to tell me what you \Nthink, spit it out already!
0.5;He certainly has the most \Nsuspicious face of the bunch.
0.5;It looked like he was sending \Nsome kind of weird signal.
0.5;He was using a hand mirror \Nto check his bangs.
0.5;It just looked weird because he was \Nusing his fingers to fix his bangs
0.5;He was hiding the bouquet of roses \Nbehind his back while he waited
0.5;because he wants to surprise \Nwhoever he's meeting with a gift.
0.5;What about the woman wearing \Na white rose on her head?
0.5;It must have been a small \Nweapon or something.
0.5;She probably took them off because \Nthey were hurting her feet.
0.5;Even bad guys have to deal \Nwith ill-fitting shoes.
0.5;But normally I wouldn't expect someone \Nto wear ill-fitting shoes to a drug deal.
0.5;It's possible during the deal \Nsomeone might report them,
0.5;Ill-fitting high heels are \Nthe worst choice of footwear.
0.5;The guy's trading partner is \Nwaiting for a drug dealer.
0.5;Normally you'd expect him to come wearing \Nsomething plain and inconspicuous.
0.5;It would be a different story if they \Nwere meeting in a deserted alleyway,
0.5;but the deal is happening \Non the crowded Ebisubashi.
0.5;they would stand out in the \Nmemories of passers-by.
0.5;She wouldn't be confusing by \Nusing a differently colored rose.
0.5;Her elaborate hairstyle, ill-fitting \Nshoes, and rose corsage.
0.5;The girl was probably invited to a \Nwedding or some other kind of party
0.5;but you'd be stupid to hit \Non a girl before a drug deal.
0.5;Why would Kazuha talk to such \Na gaudy looking drug dealer?
0.5;Normally you'd notice \Nthese things immediately.
0.5;Kazuha-chan could get caught up in \Nsomething if the dealer arrives.
0.5;You need to take her and get \Nout of there immediately.
0.5;You need to take Kazuha by the \Nhand and get away from there.
0.5;"""I saw my old neighbor \NYakumaru-san at Ebisubashi."
0.5;"I'm hanging around to see \Nwhat his date looks like."""
0.5;He probably pretended to be a serious \Nperson and approached Kazuha.
0.5;Maybe he's trying to butter her up so \Nhe can get information on the police.
0.5;I'll throw the lot of you \Ninto the Dotonbori River!
0.5;their agents can bleach their hair \Nor get tattoos and nose piercings.
0.5;Naturally they're allowed to have \Nguns if their jobs require it.
0.5;I've heard a lot of narcs are \Nformer pharmaceutical students.
0.5;Then that man was there to \Nconduct an investigation, right?
0.5;According to the call I just \Ngot from Inspector Otaki,
0.5;a drug dealer apprehended in Osaka\Nconfessed the location and sign of his deal,
0.5;so that agent dressed up as him and \Nwas waiting for the drug dealer.
0.5;That's why he asked his colleagues \Nto take her away from the location.
0.5;If the dealer showed up, he \Nwould have found it suspicious,
0.5;It sounds like they caught the \Ndealer at a nearby comic café,
0.5;Once Inspector Otaki explained \Nthe situation, they let him go.
0.5;I can't believe they went \Nhard on a high school kid.
0.5;"You said, ""What do you think \Nyou're doing to my dear Kazuha?!"""
0.5;Don't say weird things if you don't \Nhave the evidence to back it up!
0.5;Maybe there's something\Nwrong with your ears.
