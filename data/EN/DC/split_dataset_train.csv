0.35363457760314343;We were nearly stranded on an island\Nbefore we were picked up by a ship that the Hatamoto family had reserved.
0.3990719257540603;On our way back to land, Hatamoto Gozo,\Nhead of the Hatamoto family, was murdered in his room.
0.5;The main suspect was Hatamoto Takeshi,\Nwho entered the family by marrying Hatamoto Natsue.
0.35624123422159887;He turned out to be the son of Zaiki Isao,\Nwho killed himself after Gozo took over his company 10 years earlier!
0.5286415711947627;Hatamoto Tatsuo, Akie's husband, was found dead,\Nand Takeshi had escaped from the storeroom!
0.28;This never would've happened\Nif you hadn't brought Takeshi into our family!

0.5347826086956522;So if someone did unlock it,\Nthen he has an accomplice in this room!
0.3123644251626898;At the time of Tatsuo-san's murder,\Nthe three of you were alone in your private rooms, while you two were together in your shared room.
0.3702770780856423;Which means that just like the first murder,\Naside from everyone who was with Natsue-san, nobody here has an alibi!
0.7481108312342569;Which means that just like the first murder, aside from everyone who was with Natsue-san,\Nnobody here has an alibi!
0.38631346578366443;I'm sure he was pretty pissed\Nafter Grandfather tore up his prize-winning drawing!
0.40213523131672596;But even if he wasn't against it,\NI don't think his wife Mariko-sama would have allowed it either...
0.5434782608695652;You attach a heavy weight to the breaker, balance it around a fulcrum,\Nand then put a candle in the middle.
0.632890365448505;After enough time passes, the rope burns apart,\Nwhich causes the weight to pull down on the breaker.
0.4946004319654428;Judging from how much of the candle has melted,\Nthis was all set up quite a while ago.
0.5716395864106352;Yes. They're both cousins, and although it may not look like it,\Nthey've been good friends since they were little.
0.5064220183486239;Yes. Come to think of it,\NGozo-sama was extremely opposed to them, too.
0.7667304015296367;One knife we found right after Ichiro-kun was attacked,\Nbut where's the other one?
0.3137614678899083;He has something important to say,\Nso he wants everyone to come to Akie-san's room in 10 minutes.
0.5535117056856187;First was Incident #1, in which Mr. Gozo was murdered in his room,\Nwhich had been locked from the inside.
0.39087947882736157;From the fact that there was blood on the doorframe,\NMr. Gozo likely escaped back into his room after he was stabbed outside.
0.5863309352517986;Even though Mr. Gozo was stabbed outside his room,\Nthere were no blood marks in the hallway.
0.46975806451612906;Are you sure the killer didn't wipe it up\Nto delay us from discovering the corpse?
0.4304932735426009;I can understand if the killer accidentally dropped it\Nwhile stabbing the victim and then escaping...
0.6027190332326284;In other words, the killer purposely left the flower on the ground\Nin order to make Takeshi-san look guilty.
0.3282636248415716;Unlike the first incident with its flower\Nand the third incident with its fancy set-up, this incident lacked any sort of artificiality.
0.6434782608695652;We found one of them at the scene of Incident #3,\Nbut where did the other one go?
0.60625;The thud was likely the sound of the killer striking Tatsuo-san,\Nbut what was the splash that came before it?
0.27111111111111114;Here's what I'm thinking--\Nthe splash sound was the other knife from this case.
0.4752475247524752;If Tatsuo-san just happened to see it thrown overboard,\Nthe killer could have killed him to keep things quiet.
0.7306397306397306;Escape would have been impossible\Nunless someone unlocked it for him!
0.41166936790923825;Tatsuo-san's murder wasn't part of the killer's plan,\Nand it took place while Takeshi-san was locked up.
0.44171779141104295;The killer worked so hard to make Takeshi-san look guilty,\Nbut this 2nd murder would do just the opposite and prove his innocence.
0.284;I couldn't stand around doing nothing,\Nand as I was pounding on the door, it suddenly unlocked.
0.47533632286995514;Realizing that I would be blamed again,\NI ran into Akie-san's room, whose door just happened to be open.
0.6936170212765957;So the person who stabbed Ichiro-san during Incident #3\Nwasn't him either...
0.4092769440654843;The killer had managed to frame Takeshi-san,\Nbut now it looked like he had an accomplice who had let him out!
0.6232638888888888;Flustered, the murderer came up with a scheme\Nto avoid any further suspicion...
0.5371621621621622;You don't mean to say--\NThat's right.
0.3776595744680851;The reason you put the lights out\Nwas because you didn't want to identify your attacker.
0.6769596199524941;If you said it was Takeshi-san and then he was found innocent later,\Nthen all the suspicion would fall onto you.
0.6255144032921811;And right before Mr. Gozo was murdered,\Nhe was drawing a picture on the deck.
0.6109422492401215;Bread pieces are sometimes used as erasers for charcoal sketches,\Nand I hear that these pieces often fall into artists' cuffs.
0.7016706443914081;Ichiro! Don't tell me you--\NThat's right.
0.32427184466019415;Unable to reveal your feelings to Natsue-san,\Nyou went to Mr. Gozo and-- It's true! I asked him to let me marry Natsue-san!
0.4262135922330097;Unable to reveal your feelings to Natsue-san, you went to Mr. Gozo and--\NIt's true! I asked him to let me marry Natsue-san!
0.46178861788617886;And soon after that, almost as if to spite me,\Nhe announced that Natsue-san was going to marry Takeshi-san!
0.6100840336134454;And then when he yelled at me yesterday\Nwhile I was on the deck, drawing Natsue-san...
0.4223433242506812;I am the son of Zaiki Isao,\Nwho committed suicide after the Hatamoto Group took over his company.

0.589825119236884;This is Kitamura Mitsuru-san, the proprietor of Kitamura Hardware,\Nand housewife Bando Atsuko-san.
0.3953846153846154;In other words, neither of you have alibis,\Nbut you have clear motives.
0.6717663421418637;But I was waiting for Yuto-san at the convenience store parking lot\Nacross from this building.
0.47446083995459704;I know how the culprit entered the office\Nand why they had to kill Kajiura-san after killing President Tsuchida.
0.6577540106951871;They crossed the window facing the convenience store\Nand headed towards the president's office.
0.4088235294117647;When the culprit entered the president's office at the end of the hallway,\Nthey bludgeoned the detestable President Tsuchida with all their rage.
0.6625874125874126;Yes, they were discovered by Kajiura-san,\Nwho entered from the main office.

0.21881390593047034;While gathering information,\Nwe heard you were borrowing money at a friend's house when the murders took place.

0.5738724727838258;Yes, if you approach this case normally,\Nthe culprit must've hated President Tsuchida.
0.2436670687575392;It's the reason he was killed,\Nwhy Kajiura-san got caught up in it, and why the culprit is Kitamura-san.
0.5524728588661038;It's the reason he was killed, why Kajiura-san got caught up in it,\Nand why the culprit is Kitamura-san.
0.5862068965517241;First, the true culprit stole a towel embroidered with the name of Kitamura-san's shop\Nand punctured his scooter's tire so he wouldn't have an alibi.
0.5479651162790697;Once they were invited inside,\Nthey killed Kajiura-san with a knife.

0.3616279069767442;And in order to hide their true intention,\Nthe culprit murdered President Tsuchida, who was hated by everyone.

0.6975;The Hana-no-Machi line runs parallel to the Yu-no-Yama line,\Nwhich we took.

0.3793706293706294;I didn't have any 1000-yen bills to give him change with,\Nso I gave him his change in coins, which is why I remember him.

0.4655581947743468;Maybe his button was about to come off\Nbecause the victim had grabbed it?!
0.6072727272727273;So that's why he--\NThere's no doubt about it!
0.5333333333333333;He wiped the front of the button\Nto remove the victim's fingerprints!
0.4776386404293381;And the victim died from an injection of potassium chloride,\Nwhich would be difficult for anyone but a doctor to get!
0.4476987447698745;It's clear that you and the victim were on different trains\Nfrom what Mori-san and the others have said.
0.5555555555555556;Say, why did you take the Yu-no-Yama Line\Ninstead of the Hana-no-Machi Line?
0.5389344262295082;I could have ridden either one,\Nbut Dr. Date bought me the ticket, so...
0.5347368421052632;I tried to pay him back for my ticket,\Nbut he refused to accept my money.
0.3188405797101449;So Dr. Date suggested taking the Yu-no-Yama Line\Nand then faked an argument to move to the rear car...

0.6493212669683258;This storage room within a shopping mall where the crime took place\Nhappens to be under construction.
0.5121107266435986;One of them lifts boxes using that crane,\Nand the other stacks and secures them in place.

0.5124875124875125;I can only guess that the stress of dealing with all those crimes\Nhas gotten to him and caused him to hallucinate...

0.4033923303834808;The killer opened the murder room window at a certain angle\Nand made his fake murders in the storeroom reflect off of it so that I would see it from the south ward.
0.4470588235294118;And then, at 11:30,\Nhe called the victim into the room and murdered him.
0.5457875457875457;To do that, the killer visited my room, opened the curtains,\Nand had me take an adjusted amount of sleeping medicine.
0.6100131752305665;He then knocked me out with a blunt object after I rushed into the room\Nand put the knife in my hand to get my fingerprints on it.

0.35374149659863946;They were swinging it\Nso intently you could hear it in the dark.
0.45734597156398105;Almost as if they were conducting\Nsome kind of ritual.
0.4200913242009132;If that hose wasn't the weapon,\Nwhat else could they have been doing with the hose next to the body?
0.25685425685425683;The medical examiner said that when she fell,\Nshe probably hit her head on the edge of the stairs.
0.41122565864833904;If the culprit had taped something to the end of the hose,\Nand used it to threaten her, maybe the victim fell while trying to avoid it.
0.38619854721549635;The woman was still wearing her shoes,\Nso it's clear she ran into the robber before she entered the house.
0.2391304347826087;Which means\Nthe culprit taped something to the end of the hose after they committed the murder.
0.12548512289780078;In other words,\Nthey prioritized taping something to the end of the hose and swinging it around over running away.

0.4325808419768151;Yes. Tengan-san is the one who set up Togawa-san's stolen recorder and speakers\Nand told him he'd check his progress the next day so he'd practice alone and have no alibi.
0.6195190947666195;Of course, that's because you grabbed the weapon barehanded,\Nso you'd fall under suspicion first.
0.16837209302325581;After committing the crime,\Nyou put on gloves and put the victim's blood on Togawa-san's glasses, which you stole beforehand.
0.19795221843003413;In the morning,\Nyou were woken by Togawa-san and pretended you had just learned of your wife's death.

0.5901898734177216;Then you pretended to have a split personality,\Nand claimed the doll ordered you to do it, initially casting suspicion on yourself.
0.39356814701378257;You transferred suspicion to Togawa-san,\Nand had the police discover the glasses to seal the deal.

0.7988505747126436;While you left your doll here to meet with your staff in another room,\NI had it examined.
0.670863309352518;Furthermore, another person's sweat was collected from the fibers,\Nand DNA was detected.

0.4744429882044561;Most likely, the killer told him to wait there with the door locked\Nbecause he had something important and secret to tell him.

0.5341772151898734;If that was the reason, then Shibata-san became hostile,\Ngrabbed a weapon from the desk...
0.16905901116427433;At first glance,\Nit seems like one man was stabbed and immediately pushed the other.

0.456198347107438;Based on the direction it came from,\Nwe knew immediately that it was you.

0.4718181818181818;What? But we just investigated the case and concluded that—\NDon't you realize there's no way Shibata-san could have killed Kawai-san?
0.21414728682170542;If the smaller Shibata-san\Ntried to stab the much taller Kawai-san in the chest, he would use a reverse grip.

0.37398373983739835;It's hard to imagine he pushed him\Nhard enough to kill him from a seated position.
0.42265193370165743;I don't know what happened between you two then,\Nbut you decided to kill him, grabbed the ice pick, and finished off your gravely wounded husband.

0.5478260869565217;Kitagami-san's body was dressed in a suit and necktie,\Neven though he was supposedly drinking at home.
0.6490765171503958;But, Mori-kun, it's possible the bottles in his apartment\Nhad been left out for a while and Kitagami-san had been out drinking.
0.5793226381461676;There were still bubbles in the glass of beer\Nin Kitagami-san's room.
0.521193092621664;The case in which Sawada Ryosuke-san,\Nthis room's resident, murdered Kitagami-san.
0.6551204819277109;Kitagami-san got drunk, tripped on a bottle,\Nand fell from his apartment's balcony.
0.591743119266055;Sawada-san, after killing Kitagami-san,\Nyou attempted to throw him from the balcony.
0.5973282442748091;So in order to throw him over the edge,\Nyou lifted him onto the railing.
0.4465875370919881;He entered this room to burgle it,\Nand ran into you when you came home.
0.4134790528233151;When I borrowed the bathroom here,\Nthere was a big bag stuffed into the bathroom cabinet.
0.32729624838292365;Sawada-san, I apologize,\Nbut you don't look like you could afford to buy so many expensive jewels.
0.7645536869340233;Sawada-san, I apologize, but you don't look like you could afford to buy\Nso many expensive jewels.

0.4166666666666667;In exchange, we agreed to forget\Nabout the burglary and jewel robbery.
0.5702127659574469;Kitagami-san's eyelids were red and swollen not from drinking,\Nbut because he was sprayed with tear gas.
0.6932826362484157;Tear gas contains UV paint so the person who used it\Ncan be tracked down even if they wash their clothes.

0.6968503937007874;But she couldn't handle the way he believed everything would go as he wanted,\Nso Motoko asked to break off their engagement.
0.22408026755852842;No matter where she went,\Nhe'd use his money and power to find her and bring her back.
0.5547850208044383;If you made it seem like she'd been murdered and her body hidden,\Neven Toriumi-san would have to give up.

0.5621301775147929;Yes. He picked up when I called at 8:15,\Nbut there was no answer when I called at 8:55.
0.3118712273641851;During those four minutes--\NYes, I did leave the studio, but I went to the restroom!
0.43701226309921964;Come on, now! If you think I'm lying,\Nthen try running from the studio to this 4th-floor room and back!
0.628968253968254;A secret path that takes you from the studio to that room and back\Nin under four minutes!
0.5712270803949224;No. If the killer entered through the window,\Nthe victim would have been driven to the door.
0.5102040816326531;What if--\NConan-kun!
0.648854961832061;Aha! There's the definitive proof\Nthat you're the killer!

0.5359477124183006;Alright! Now to--\NI don't know what to say!
0.5403422982885085;Yeah... You can go for today--\NNot so fast, Matsuo-san!
0.6091954022988506;I wouldn't want the criminal to leave\Nwhen the detective show's just about to begin...
0.3836589698046181;But Matsuo-san was hosting a live television show\Nin the 9th-floor studio at the time of the murder!

0.6804435483870968;Matsuo-san most likely stuck himself out this window, aimed down three floors to the room in question--\NThe victim was shot in the head here.

0.42676767676767674;After Matsuo-san shot him like so,\Nhe dropped the gun into the room.
0.735632183908046;The person who called the victim right before he was shot\Nwas the killer!
0.3574660633484163;If you want proof he shot from above,\Nthere's a bullet hole on the ground beneath the window.
0.6012084592145015;After using said trick to kill Suwa-san in the room three floors below,\Nyou returned to the studio before the video clip ended.
0.5173553719008265;Assuming you hadn't called anybody else afterwards,\Nit would've connected with the bar I called.

0.544137022397892;It's like they say-- getting ready for the festival\Nis more fun than the festival itself.
0.492619926199262;I was in the middle of taping a drama,\Nbut I was so moved I rushed right over here!
0.5486486486486486;Next Conan's Hint:\NBathroom stall.
0.6808059384941676;"Yeah. Most of Mr. Dorakura's novels are centered around vampires,\Nso he's earned the nickname ""Mr. Dracula."""
0.6430517711171662;He's even started to branch out into heroic fantasy novels,\Nand is gaining female fans, too.
0.5095367847411444;I think I'll--\NC'mon!
0.26118067978533094;It's true that the Count Dracula we know\Nwas a monster created by Bram Stoker in his 1897 novel, Dracula.
0.5145518044237486;But, there were several noblemen in medieval Europe\Nwho were feared as vampires because of the atrocities they committed.
0.5423728813559322;Dorakura-sensei has collected many old documents concerning that,\Nwhich is why I visit here personally.
0.3967828418230563;Climbing up the cliff would be impossible,\Nand the rough waves in the lake would quickly capsize any boat.
0.4231311706629055;So, even with the window open,\Nthis study room was still as good as locked...
0.46714031971580816;What a vulgar murderer,\Nkilling him with a wooden stake, as if he were Dracula...
0.6949429037520392;In short, the killer snuck in and stole the stake\Nafter Tadokoro-san came to get the movie.
0.583793738489871;Then, after Tadokoro-san delivered the movie to the study room,\Nthe person murdered Mr. Dorakura.
0.4100817438692098;The only one who could've stolen the stake\Nis you, who went to browse the library.
0.5192307692307693;Hamura-san used it to climb up to your room,\Nthen traversed the corridor roof to reach the study.
0.6189655172413793;Then, he called out to Mr. Dorakura to let him inside,\Nthen murdered him when he got the chance!
0.642962962962963;Eight years ago, my father's business took a nosedive\Nand was on the verge of bankruptcy.
0.25404376784015226;Dorakura was an old acquaintance of my father's,\Nand in exchange for financing the business, he demanded my hand in marriage after I had just graduated college!
0.39667458432304037;If the company went bankrupt,\Nso many people, and families, would be affected!
0.510828025477707;We later learned that the business' downfall\Nwas actually because of Dorakura's behind-the-scenes dirty work.
0.6416256157635468;But, by the time we found out, the company was already in his name,\Nand he threatened to destroy the company if we divorced...
0.8125;You left her room, climbed onto the corridor roof from this window,\Nand went to the study.
0.5622406639004149;First, I thought only Hamura-san could have taken the stake,\Nbut actually, anyone could have stolen it from outside!

0.4716666666666667;She and husband Yamato Kohei had one child,\Nbut all three suddenly disappeared five years later.

0.5254237288135594;His face was burned\Nin an accident long ago.
0.6460032626427407;I think modern plastic surgery could fix most of it,\Nbut he's against the idea.
0.3469675599435825;We saw the killer shortly after 10:00 pm,\Nwhen everyone happened to be in the third-story bedroom.
0.6322869955156951;Analysis should prove--\NSay!
0.574468085106383;They seemed to be friends since childhood,\Nbut they were like cat and dog after the incident...

0.6592797783933518;Me and my old man figured it was a burglar scoping the place out,\Nso we brought in security and called you.
0.42569659442724456;We thought he'd show up again tonight,\Nbut it was a life that was taken!
0.6868686868686869;We then searched every nook and cranny of the mansion,\Nbut Hideomi-san was nowhere to be found.
0.4602941176470588;Mitsuaki-san was pushed off the veranda\Nat 10:00 the night before last, 44 hours ago.
0.4677804295942721;If Hideomi-san drowned himself in this pond before we arrived,\Neverything would fit.
0.6640866873065016;Still, as hostile as Hideomi-san and Mitsuaki-san were with each other,\Nmurder is a bit much...
0.4743401759530792;It's possible. Hideomi-sama and Yasue-ojousama were very close,\Nso he was vehemently against her marriage with Mitsuaki-sama.
0.5567375886524822;"""The marks on the knife match the wounds on Mitsuaki-san's arm,\Nand the blood on the knife matches his, as well."

0.521551724137931;Either way, there's little doubt that someone drowned him\Nwith the will after poisoning him.

0.31039136302294196;Judging by the state of your yard,\Nit's hard to imagine that you gardened on a regular basis.
0.44952681388012616;Furious at having your branches cut,\Nyou didn't go to the trouble of using the gate to enter the yard.

0.6839309428950863;While being questioned about 100 meters away from Conan-kun and his friends,\Nhe suddenly ran away.
0.4169986719787517;It was shocking and scary, but\Nhe didn't seem like such a bad man to me.
0.49530956848030017;All right! Detective Boys—\NWe're in a hospital, Genta-kun.
0.3406813627254509;He said he was late for work,\Nand was going to be fired if he was late again.
0.38448275862068965;Also, according to the old woman,\Nhe didn't seem well even before he was pushed.
0.5154867256637168;So he said, “Fine, I'm getting out.”\NThat was where we were earlier...
0.3476190476190476;This is the next town over,\Nbut geographically, it's actually right next to that other place.
0.49353448275862066;What? Inspector, you told me to come here\Nso you could reveal the truth behind the case...
0.45278450363196127;If he smelled like a hospital, or in other words, disinfectant,\Nhe could've been a patient at another hospital.
0.8280701754385965;You're forcing the connection between myself and the culprit,\NMister Detective.
0.7556207233626588;We had forensics dust this car's windows for fingerprints at Mori-san's request,\Nand they match the patient's.
0.5056818181818182;So I thought it was divine punishment instead of coincidence or irony\Nthat he was brought to my hospital and became my patient.
0.6058823529411764;When you said you'd dispose of the paint-stained jacket,\Nthe doctor refused, didn't he?
0.3715170278637771;On the second day of his Meijin title match, Haneda Shukichi,\Nalso known as Sextuple Crown Taiko Meijin, received a letter before the match.
0.6513761467889908;Inside, he found a code and a photo of his ex-girlfriend,\Nand kidnapping victim, Lieutenant Miyamoto Yumi.
0.3778409090909091;In order to save Yumi-san,\NHaneda left his match and headed to the shrine indicated in the code.

0.6391752577319587;What's curious is the rook and bishop pierced by the nail,\Nand the overlapping gold and silver generals.
0.5238095238095238;Also, there's only one each of the other pieces,\Nbut for some reason there are two bishops.
0.5521126760563381;The first code was about the seven major shogi titles,\Nand the second was about Shizugatake's Seven Spears.
0.5574912891986062;The gold general is a hard worker that moves as much as the king,\Nand the bishop is a powerful piece that can move any distance diagonally.
0.6329284750337382;If you want to save Yumi-san and return to the match,\Nyou have only about thirty more minutes.
0.4712230215827338;And based on this rook's position,\NYumi-san is probably being held captive at...
0.5436105476673428;"The gold general labeled ""lazy"" is sloth overlapping the sorrowful silver general,\Nand the rook overlapping the vain bishop is pride."
0.5513157894736842;Since we solved one through three, in a Meijin title match,\Nyou win if you take the fourth match.
0.31272727272727274;When I realized I could win,\NI got excited, and my fingers slipped on the piece I was playing with, making a sound.
0.5005347593582887;After I left the café, he drugged and kidnapped me,\Nbut he let me use the bathroom and even fed me.

0.513262599469496;I thought I'd live the laid-back freelance life forever,\Nbut his terms were so generous, I agreed to work for him.
0.3778580024067389;He always made decisions on his own,\Nbut it was awful of him to make such a big decision without discussing it with me first.
0.558282208588957;I haven't decided yet, but since I was originally freelance,\NI'll be fine without a company.
0.23076923076923078;Forgive me for asking,\Nbut were you and President Kureno dating?
0.4596977329974811;Yes, although shortly after that picture was taken,\Nhe said he'd fallen in love with someone else and broke up with me.
0.564299424184261;I didn't trust President Kureno,\Nso I was secretly in discussions with them.
0.671353251318102;The poison thought to be used in Kureno-san's murder\Nwas found in the body's jacket pocket.
0.2478134110787172;However, in their rush to leave,\Nthe culprit left the scene of the crime without replacing his shoe on his foot.
0.4088235294117647;After strangling him using some type of string or cord,\Nthe culprit strangled him again with the wine napkin.

0.48034934497816595;He claimed sole credit for all our success,\Neven though he couldn't do anything without me.
0.601027397260274;Both you and I were just being used\Nby that piece of trash.
0.528415961305925;And besides, Koshimoto-san didn't seem to know,\Nbut the president said he wanted to work with this team again someday.
0.6192528735632183;Yes. Normally they go with Professor Agasa,\Nbut Agasa-san is sick.

0.5677339901477833;Because of this face, people often look away,\Nbut they rarely stare.

0.5194805194805194;Since my tent was right next to the tent that burned,\NI remembered the faces and order of the people who came this way.
0.3601161665053243;Surely you didn't ignore the tent engulfed in flames\Nso you could observe the person you're so interested in, right?
0.3890449438202247;Though since there was a grade school teacher present,\NI may have underestimated the situation and believed nothing serious would occur.
0.6738768718801996;Let's start with Furuoka Midori-san\Nwho visited the victim's tent first.
0.5600448933782267;Because the murder victim was holding scissors invented by Professor Agasa,\NOkiya Subaru-san and I accompanied the professor to the crime scene.

0.1890359168241966;Come to think of it,\Nhe had a plastic bag containing a little figurine about this small.
0.3594936708860759;He said it was a prize from his candy shop,\Nand that he was going to give it to his grandchild.
0.3368560105680317;Come to think of it, one of those colored balls I used\Nto buy at the neighborhood candy shop as a kid came flying over the wall.
0.5038560411311054;Just before Senba-san arrived,\Nthere was a yellow one about this size.
0.4011627906976744;There's a park on the other side of the wall,\Nso some kids were probably playing baseball.

0.6085714285714285;Looks like we found the weapon\Nwe've been looking for.
0.5847457627118644;Then you should've had one of those, too,\Nso why didn't you?
0.8013355592654424;I bought the capsule toy, honey, colored ball,\Nand large marble you asked for.
0.3911525029103609;Then put the marble inside the capsule,\Npour the honey over it, and close the capsule again.

0.518324607329843;I waited for Hiyama to come meet me,\Nbut he never showed up, so I went inside.
0.5909090909090909;Of course, not to perform a biological function,\Nbut to collect the murder weapon.
0.5435684647302904;In the bathroom across from the changing room\Nwhere Hiyama-san was murdered...
0.679890560875513;The colored ball rolled off the sloped roof,\Nbut even if you tilt this capsule...
0.6187943262411347;So unlike the colored ball that fell right away,\Nthe capsule rolled slowly.
0.38489208633093525;Once it entered the gutter,\Nit slowly rolled along.
0.5343511450381679;Then it fell to the bottom the same way rainwater would\Nand came out the end of the gutter.
0.5432692307692307;Gutters are slanted slightly towards the edge\Nso rainwater flows through them better.
0.363013698630137;By the way, Senba-san threw the colored ball,\Nalong with the capsule, from outside the fence to disguise the sound.
0.6379781420765027;Since the bodyguard mistook the colored ball as the source of the sound,\Nhe left the area immediately.
0.6488095238095238;If you put that ball inside a sock and made a blackjack,\Nit would dramatically increase its lethality.
0.4910277324632953;The honey around the wound\Non the murdered Hiyama-san's head proves it.
0.625;If I hit him hard enough to kill him,\NI'd have blood on me.
0.30132939438700146;You washed off the blood that got on your body\Nin the bathroom next to the changing room, didn't you?

0.30756302521008405;According to the manager here,\Nthe boat's owner simply abandoned it and it hasn't been used since.

0.42558425584255843;My friend asked me about a murder\Nthat happened at a certain college one year ago.
0.5975820379965457;The police arrested the professor's assistant,\Nwho was also the older brother of my friend.
0.637203166226913;Allegedly his motive was the professor claimed a paper he had written\Nwas plagiarized from his own work and threatened to ruin his career.
0.470404984423676;But my friend can't believe he'd steal another person's paper,\Nmuch less kill someone over one.
0.5727636849132176;But ultimately, he offered no other testimony at his trial,\Nand no appeal was made.
0.3916554508748318;And you're Mei-san, the younger sister of Ashida Hiroto-san,\Nthe man currently serving time in prison.
0.34253361641896674;The layered pages torn from the Japanese edition of Caseweek\Nwere pages 11 and 9, 19 and 1, and 11 and 9 again.

0.36441717791411044;Because she wanted me\Nto reveal her brother's true motive.
0.3650568181818182;And perhaps, if possible,\Nto stop her from doing what she's about to do.
0.5126658624849216;First, as far as I know, she may have been appointed by the court,\Nbut Kisaki-sensei would never step down from a case.
0.6802218114602587;Even after she was dismissed, rather than moving on,\Nshe continued investigating the case.
0.5240715268225584;She was probably searching for documents\Ndemonstrating extenuating circumstances that didn't touch on his true motive.
0.3727891156462585;So she tore pages from the magazine featuring an article\Non her brother's case that she always carried with her and left a coded message, all so she could use me to reveal the truth about the case and tell it to the world.

0.5740740740740741;Fukuda Tameo-san, who discovered the body,\Nfound it when he happened to pass through this area.
0.32;Based on the body's condition,\Nwe believe he was killed around 9 PM last night.
0.4990990990990991;He seems to have been stabbed in the torso\Nseveral times by a sharp awl-like object.
0.42463235294117646;Since the wallet full of money was left on the body,\Nand due to the relentless nature of the murder, it's likely...

0.46367851622874806;Amagi Tatsuya-san, who was living off his inheritance from his parents,\Nmoved to this town about three months ago.
0.44609665427509293;We asked the neighborhood association president,\NBando-san, to make him stop.
0.5360824742268041;Yeah, we found Bando-san's medical examination card\Nnext to the body.
0.538562091503268;Maybe neighborhood association president Bando Hikoichi-san\Ninvited Amagi Tatsuya-san out last night so he could tell him to stop, but...
0.45102040816326533;Amagi-san wouldn't listen so,\Nhe stabbed him in a rage.
0.6342494714587738;Don't you think it's too sloppy to leave\Npersonally identifying evidence at a crime scene?
0.5421455938697318;But if the residents were pestering him,\Nhe couldn't have avoided talking to Amagi-san.
0.4246861924686193;Since he was so unreliable,\Nhe may have brought the awl with him for self-defense.
0.3955637707948244;That useless man\Nfinally did something useful for the neighborhood.
0.5574468085106383;He came with his friend Chino Yosuke-sensei,\Nwho teaches Japanese history at Haido College.
0.4852459016393443;He was indeed poisoned with pesticide,\Nbut it was mixed into the alcohol in the bottle.
0.44221105527638194;The method they used is easily discovered,\Nand they didn't even lock the front door.
0.4919908466819222;If Bando-san didn't commit suicide,\Nthen what about Amagi-san's murder?
0.46720214190093706;In order to make it look like Bando Hikoichi-san did it,\Nhe murdered Bando-san and made it look like a suicide.
0.42113564668769715;If that housekeeper is right,\Nthen it must've been left by someone who visited after dusk.
0.5678160919540229;Since his belongings were found at the crime scene,\Nthat makes him a suspect.
0.40559440559440557;The culprit killed Amagi-san,\Nand tried to make it look like Bando-san did it, right?
0.46769662921348315;But Chino-sensei doesn't live in this neighborhood,\Nso it wasn't as though Amagi-san was bothering him.
0.4040632054176072;To avoid the police's suspicion,\Nhe decided to make it look like a suicide.
0.36633663366336633;So Chino used the fact that the neighborhood association\Nwas pestering him to talk to Amagi Tatsuya-san.
0.5426621160409556;If you assume Bando-san was killed only\Nto make Amagi-san's death look like a suicide...
0.3699825479930192;Is it possible for such a historic old mansion\Nnot to have any treasures?
0.44100801832760594;It's hard to imagine someone who likes mysteries making basic mistakes,\Nlike putting poison in a bottle or leaving the front door unlocked, right?
0.6539235412474849;And he must know of all kinds of ways to fabricate an alibi,\Nbut he didn't make a single attempt.
0.35196687370600416;If someone else killed Amagi-san and Bando-san,\Nand tried to pin their murders on Chino-san, then they would've killed Chino-san, too.
0.7836438923395446;If someone else killed Amagi-san and Bando-san, and tried to pin their murders on Chino-san,\Nthen they would've killed Chino-san, too.
0.5759162303664922;It is strange that a murderer who killed two people\Ndidn't do anything to Chino-san.
0.4620355411954766;The man who first discovered Amagi-san's body and the woman\Nwho was most aggressively pestering Bando-san were there.
0.597953216374269;He forgot what time our return ship left,\Nso we got to ride on this big one instead!
0.5034013605442177;We had our ceremony this morning on Hatamoto Island,\Nthe same island you were on!
0.500998003992016;You must think pretty highly of yourself\Nif you're making decisions without approval.

0.6881443298969072;Someone stabbed him outside the room and then kept coming for him,\Nso he locked himself inside to escape his attacker!
0.44749403341288785;I thought I was going to faint\Nwhen I heard that you're actually the son of Zaiki Isao!
0.456353591160221;One year later, his wife died of an illness,\Nand their only son was apparently placed in an institution.

0.5465346534653466;I had you pegged as a pretty staunch fellow,\Nbut it looks like I was wrong.
0.44728915662650603;Now that Takeshi-san has killed the old man,\Nhe'll never make that stupid announcement about his inheritance!

0.20848708487084872;Hey, what are you--\NHey, did you hear anything strange just now?
0.6744791666666666;The cause of death was most likely brain damage\Ncaused by a blow to the head.
0.32894736842105265;Judging from the wound,\Nthe murder weapon was a steel pipe or something similar.
0.3820662768031189;The thud that Conan heard\Nwas probably the sound of the killer hitting Tatsuo-san.
0.2101313320825516;The splash he heard\Nwas either the sound of the murder weapon being thrown overboard, or...
0.6239495798319328;...the sound of the killer jumping into the water\Nafter running out of places to hide!
0.5725338491295938;At any rate, there's still a high possibility\Nthat there's a killer aboard this ship.
0.5786259541984733;His motive for murder was to exact revenge on Hatamoto Gozo,\Nwho drove his father to suicide 10 years ago!

0.3022670025188917;In summary,\Nthe victim Oiso Nagami-san said she'd search for the necklace she lost at the pool alone.

0.508675799086758;Furthermore, it's hard to imagine someone put the body\Nin the middle of the pool unnoticed while you were searching.

0.5488180883864338;Just because he's ordering dishes that require soy sauce,\Ndoesn't mean he'd check how much soy sauce is left at each seat beforehand.

0.2866779089376054;Speaking of masks,\Ndidn't you have one the day of the incident?
0.347008547008547;Every time the culprit took a step,\Nhe made a click... click sound.
0.7012089810017271;Maybe he accidentally stepped on something hard and sharp\Nthat got stuck to the sole of his shoe.
0.5399610136452242;The culprit must've dropped his glasses and stepped on them\Nwhen he got into a fight with the woman.
0.6055900621118012;That's why he collected the shards of the broken lenses\Nusing the hose vacuum before running away.
0.4366576819407008;The type and prescription of a lens\Ncan be determined from the smallest piece.
0.48593073593073594;The only people who carry cases are ones who have separate pairs for near and far sight,\Nor have just recently bought a new pair.

0.3492647058823529;You probably retrieved the arms and bridge\Nthe day after the murder.
0.36061381074168797;A month ago,\Nyou bought these from an optician.
0.1839080459770115;Oh,\Nwe already found the earrings you hid in the soy sauce container.
0.6365591397849463;You probably hid them there\Nbefore Yumi and Naeko arrived at the shop.

0.47244094488188976;We just got the warrant for your arrest,\Nso we barged into the bathroom to place you under arrest.

0.46089850249584025;I hurriedly stuffed the pen and glasses case\Nthat were on the desk in my pocket when I left, though.

0.6293103448275862;I was actually crying because the badge my mom made for me\Nwas ruined.
0.5777027027027027;Besides, I didn't understand the real reason\NShinichi had me make a cherry blossom for him.

0.5026642984014209;You're planning to win her over\Nso you can do something bad, aren't you?
0.3318014705882353;I hold Ran-chan's hand while we go for walks\Nbecause she once got separated from the group, and ended up in Haido City on the other side of town.

0.689119170984456;I let her slide first because she's a nice girl who lets everyone go before her,\Nso there have been times when she didn't get to slide.
0.575591985428051;And the reason Ran-chan's spot is here\Nis because it's closest to the bathroom.
0.518918918918919;One time she didn't make it in time\Nbecause she was sleeping far away from the bathroom.
0.4120300751879699;Also, I'll tell you why we switched parks\Nwhen we go on a walk tomorrow, little detective.
0.2972677595628415;Because walking farther\Nwill help build your strength, and you'll have an easier time remembering traffic rules if we cross more crosswalks.

0.40476190476190477;She's actually\Nmy wife.
0.5744186046511628;She's always been sickly,\Nso she's been in the hospital for a while.
0.47126436781609193;Next month she's moving to a hospital\Nin the mountains where the air is better.
0.4197901049475262;So I thought I'd show her\Nyou guys until she moved.
0.2822384428223844;So honestly,\Nit was just me being selfish.
0.4340909090909091;My badge is made\Nof paper just like hers.
0.4074074074074074;And if we're friends,\Nthen we're not outsiders!

0.6408094435075885;On the back of cherry blossom petals,\NI made a new childhood friend.
0.6534508076358296;Shin-chan, are you sure you're not jealous\Nbecause that teacher's giving Ran-chan all his attention?
0.4896907216494845;He sees the single truth for what it is,\Nand looks like a kid but has the mind of an adult!
0.44559585492227977;Shaddup. I don't feel like hearing that from you,\Nespecially since you only dropped by on your way to play.
0.45714285714285713;Say! Are those the guys from the criminal group\Nthat stole 100 million yen and still hasn't been caught?!
0.5906821963394343;That's right. They stole 100 million in broad daylight,\Nwithout hurting anyone!
0.5833333333333334;Conan. Okino Yoko-chan's on a music show at 3:00,\Nand I wanna watch it in the lobby.
0.5732323232323232;Your chance to do it is before the doctors make their rounds at 3:30,\Nwhen surveillance isn't so tight. Should be simple.
0.5177111716621253;Yes. The tire tracks from the car used in the robbery\Nmatch with the car Akabane was in.
0.520259319286872;He did say they'd take care of things so I wouldn't be found out,\Nand I'd only be killing a bank robber...

0.4536741214057508;How did you--\NThat creampuff box.

0.6651376146788991;W-We ran into each other in the woods,\Nso we walked the rest of the way together...
0.6876267748478702;I was looking forward to having a high school girl visit,\Nbut she brought her boyfriend with her.
0.47516198704103674;I was terrible when I was a kid,\Nbut I got used to it after living abroad for three years.
0.403035413153457;Since we were in high school,\Nmost of what we did was during summer break.
0.24661654135338346;If there were five of you,\Ndoes that mean the woman in red we saw in the forest earlier is your fifth?
0.2990990990990991;Actually,\NI thought it might be the murderer from fifteen years ago...
0.6190476190476191;He secretly went to the rental villa with his mistress,\Nand his wife barged in with a knife.
0.5185185185185185;By the time the police heard the noise and got there,\Nthe entire room was a sea of blood.
0.5478260869565217;The wife stabbed her husband over and over,\Nuntil her white raincoat had turned bright red.
0.3312;Three years after that,\Nwe came to this rental villa during our high school summer vacation.
0.5275675675675676;Our other club member Satoko said she saw the Red Woman,\Nso we decided to go looking for her in the forest.

0.31712062256809337;A window was broken,\Nand tons of apples were rolling around inside a room.
0.2686131386861314;When we couldn't get any hot water,\Nwe found red rose petals stuffed inside the hot water heater.
0.3236514522821577;Those strange incidents and the red woman\Nyou saw in the forest were probably just someone playing pranks on us.
0.11563731931668857;But, well,\Nwe decided to ask the sharp Sera to determine the culprit for us.
0.34172661870503596;You know,\Nnow that I get a closer look, this room is covered in dust.
0.6313432835820896;Well, considering that incident happened nearby,\NI'm sure not many people want to rent this place.
0.585603112840467;We looked all around the forest,\Nbut we didn't find any clues.
0.4909090909090909;Like the sands of the Tottori sand dunes,\Nthe mystery of the robbery can't quite be caught.

0.4288770053475936;Today they entered the house, robbed it,\Nand left the pendant behind to make it look like Senda Naomi-san did it.
0.5263157894736842;If we're talking about not having the money to do what we want,\Nthen you two are in the same situation.

0.5756385068762279;This is the grave of Satomi Tadayoshi,\Nwho served as inspiration for  Nanso Satomi Hakkenden.

0.48822269807280516;Yeah. Neither one had a witness for one o'clock,\Nso it's possible that they went home once before returning to where they were.

0.6045918367346939;Dammit. Thinks she's so\Ngreat after some TV work.
0.6640866873065016;Anyway, it's probably just a prank, but everyone's scared,\Nso look into it.
0.39186295503211993;And why's that pathetic director\Ntelling me how to act?!
0.23956043956043957;This is clearly--\N--a case of cyanide poisoning.
0.4652631578947368;I heard stories about you and Mori\Nso I came to see how much you've improved.

0.4913907284768212;I heard the rumors, but that 'Sleeping Kogoro logic'\Ncould only have come from Mori Kogoro-san's teacher!
