0.5;Experiencing an event while surrounded \Nby nature does seem like it would
0.5;But now I'm the only one in this \Narea who makes puffed rice.
0.5;So, Mori-kun, you're saying \Nit was an accident?
0.5;Genichi-san fired his shotgun \Nin an attempt to defend himself.
0.5;She's having the hardest \Ntime dealing with this.
0.5;It pushed Genichi-san's body out of the thicket,\Nwhile the device itself fell down the ravine.
0.5;Why did you have us check if anyone \Nwas following us and come here?
0.5;we'll need to wait to hear \Nfrom Mizunashi Rena-san,
0.5;I know the Organization's \Nnumber two's code name is Rum.
0.5;A large man, an effeminate \Nman, and an old man...
0.5;a young guy with long hair like a girl,\Nand an old man with white hair.
0.5;I'd understand if he strangled \Nher after putting her to sleep.
0.5;That stocky man over there, that long-haired \Nman to the side, and the old man behind him.
0.5;No, a witness saw you visiting the \Nvictim's apartment between 2PM and 3PM,
0.5;But now I need that money, \Nso I asked for it back.
0.5;Yeah. The person who caused this \Nincident and the name of that kid.
0.5;I think the front door\Nwas facing the main street.
0.5;Why would a haunted house\Nbe right on a main street?
0.5;He could at least let\Nus look around the yard!
0.5;Hey! Let's forget about baseball\Nand play video games at Conan's place!
0.5;Y-Yes, good idea! We can\Nhave some snacks there, too!
0.5;He didn't let you in the yard because\Nmy sister's body is buried there!
0.5;Watanuki unquestionably used that\Nsound to dig his hole unnoticed!
0.5;They suddenly come out\Nof the ground, just like moles!
0.5;We can't say anything for\Nsure, at this stage--
0.5;Yeah. It sounded a\Nlot like Koda-san's voice.
0.5;Yes. It took place\Nabout seven minutes ago and...
0.5;I want emergency deployment\Nat all stations on the Loop Line!
0.5;There was one by\NWatanuki-san's back gate, too!
0.5;If my theory is\Ncorrect, Koda-san is--!
0.5;"In particular, the movie \N""Zero the Enforcer"" was a huge hit."
0.5;If you don't cut it out, \NI'm really going to get mad.
0.5;Then can't you ask that Dekuri person \Nfor the meaning of the cipher?
0.5;There's probably some meaning \Nto those crooked spaces.
0.5;Didn't you say you were \Ngetting dinner in the lounge?
0.5;Yeah. After that, we returned \Nto our rooms to get ready.
0.5;as though a monster with \Nwings capable of flight
0.5;B-But a monster with magic \Npowers who can fly...
0.5;By the time we arrived,\Nhe wasn't answering his door.
0.5;How was meeting the great \Nactress Kurachi Keiko?
0.5;Before you go to sleep, tell us about \Nyour confession to Mori in London.
0.5;If you don't tell us, \NI'll rip off the covers.
0.5;Come up with a plan so the people around you \Nwon't notice when you turn into a child.
0.5;But considering what happened to the \Nscriptwriter Nishiki-san, it might not open.
0.5;The media's gathered in front of the hotel.\NThey're making a huge fuss.
0.5;It can't be helped since Naomoto Award \Nwinner Nishiki Taro died last night,
0.5;There are similar ones in \Nfront of the other shops, too.
0.5;Scary rumors flow\Nthrough the darkness!
0.5;Totani-sensei was so much better.\NShe was actually nice.
0.5;I did! I told the assistant principal,\Nhe lives in my neighborhood!
0.5;As I recall, he lives alone\Nafter his wife passed away...
0.5;Umm, have you seen\Nthe assistant principal?
0.5;Let's see... Anatomy model,\Nanatomy model...
0.5;I didn't want the same\Nthing to happen at this school,
0.5;Ohata-sensei created this shocking\Nscene after opening the window.
0.5;and left the incriminating \Nwallet in a nearby trashcan.
0.5;It's difficult to wash \Nbloodstains out of clothes
0.5;didn't you pour the juice from the pickled \Nginger on your sleeve to wash out the stain?
0.5;The only shows on around that \Ntime are cartoons and kids shows.
0.5;Its payout is two-hundredfold, \Nso it's worth a million yen.
0.5;And unlike pickled ginger, \Nit doesn't leave any color.
0.5;Also, do you have the limited availability \Nseasonal grilled fish today, too?
0.5;would have no problem with a \Nbloodstain on their sleeve.
0.5;My wife wanted for nothing \Ngrowing up with them.
0.5;The restaurant we're at has \Na vintage Romanée-Conti.
0.5;I've actually never bought \Na payout ticket before.
0.5;You're just as angry as \Nyour mistress, Emi-chan.
0.5;Looks like we won't need the \NSleeping Kogoro this time.
0.5;Overcome all limits with \Nyour cool reasoning skills!
0.5;so let me perform it for you \Nin a picture-story show.
0.5;However, the important Japanese government \Nofficial ignored the village mayor's protests
0.5;The village mayor decided \Nto give up on his plan.
0.5;The truth was, the former mayor \Nwas excavating the forest
0.5;they became obsessed with Princess Gaga's \Ntreasure, and they began excavating the forest.

0.5;"""Casino and public baths \Nconstruction plans canceled."""
0.5;The former mayor knew he \Ndidn't have long to live.
0.5;But then he learned he wouldn't live to \Nsee its completion because he had cancer.
0.5;and made sure the fake treasure map \Nwould be discovered after his death.
0.5;They said you'd be here \Nif you weren't at home.
0.5;Furthermore, Lieutenant Miyamoto Yumi, who \Nnoticed something about both their bodies...
0.5;"""Target: MPD Transportation \NDepartment, Part Three!"""
0.5;I'm sorry, but could you tell \Nus more about the incident?
0.5;and forensics had finished examining the \Nscene, so I thought it'd be all right.
0.5;When I saw the photo of \NYagi's body you sent me,
0.5;None of them have present \Naddresses in this building.
0.5;And I just received a call from \Nthe forensic investigators.
0.5;Perhaps her mind was hazy since \Nshe was on the brink of death.
0.5;There are a lot of patrol \Ncars driving around.
0.5;There used to be a GPS and \Nsecurity camera inside of it.
0.5;Yeah. They want you to \Nreveal the truth there.
0.5;It's time for the great detective \NMori Kogoro to show off his skills.
0.5;Fine. As long as Ran comes back \Nsafe, I'll handle the rest.
0.5;but I thought I'd tell him about \Nthe shareholders' meeting.
0.5;Iwata-san, you said the \Nculprit was blond, correct?
0.5;But three mornings ago when \Nthe buildings were vandalized,
0.5;He was determined not to let the police \Nbeat him until he discovered the truth.
0.5;I-I may have been mistaken \Nabout the blond hair.
0.5;Did you use this toolbox to store the red \Nspray paint you used for the graffiti, too?
0.5;Mori-san called the \Nprefectural police earlier.
0.5;Isn't it also your fault for crossing\Nthe street without paying attention?
0.5;Would the police call\Na suspect on the phone?
0.5;I've brought the suspect,\Nas requested!
0.5;And even if that were true,\Nwhy would I need to kill my mother?!
0.5;In any case, it would appear\None of you two is the killer.
0.5;First, Izumi-san arrives at 8:00\Non the dot and goes inside.
0.5;I see. So this shows that you\Nembezzled money from the company.
0.5;You gotta believe me!\NI didn't do it!
0.5;What is it? Something\Nisn't right about this body!
0.5;...the culprit applied the face\Npack after killing the victim!
0.5;Y-Yes. When I came\Nover due to a false alarm,
0.5;Her face was covered\Nwith the pack and--
0.5;That's strange.\NWhy hasn't it turned up?
0.5;But the minute we lost money,\Nshe blamed it all on me...
0.5;I could postpone\Nthings if they sold it...
0.5;Yes! Hotta Industries is\Nnothing without you, Father!
0.5;You're suggesting I'm\Nplanning to kill Father over that?!
0.5;I hear you've racked up some\Nheavy-duty gambling debts lately!
0.5;so I don't know\Nwhat happened long ago.
0.5;All four of these\Ncars have slashed tires.
0.5;Say, if Ryoji-san is the killer,\Nwhy would he slash his own tires?
0.5;if his whiskey exploded\Nand he disappeared right after!
0.5;No doubt about it!\NThat person is the killer!
0.5;The piano was Kentaro's life!\NAnd he had it stolen away forever!
0.5;The moment I got her to step\Ninto that car, my revenge succeeded.
0.5;A treasure chest filled with\Nher memories with Kentaro-san,
0.5;I've killed the person\Nwho loved my son that much!
0.5;He left me all alone...\NAnd drove his own father to do this...
0.5;but I hope you understand it comes from \Na place of great respect and inspiration.
0.5;So I chided myself, but out \Nof concern for Hikone-sama,
0.5;We just stationed officers in the \Nsewer and at all connected exits.
0.5;I sensed people watching \Nme from both sides then.
0.5;so they wouldn't have \Nneeded to break his lock.
0.5;His joke quizzes can be a\Nnuisance sometimes, though.
0.5;You said the place is the site of\Na demolished mansion, right?
0.5;Lightning struck a few times\Nand the power went out.
0.5;Let's tell Inspector Megure to\Ninvestigate the neighboring building.
0.5;If the man who fell was the Gecko,\Nthen he fell not from a window,
0.5;Probably until they can't\Nsee the ball anymore.
0.5;I found this man snooping around\Ninside the house!
0.5;This man was prowling about\Nin front of the house!
0.5;Yes, though I acquired this scar\Nwhen I was still inexperienced...
0.5;You probably heard the phone ringing\Nwhen you were killing Maru-san!
0.5;So that's why you're\Ngiving us this nonsense!
0.5;then why would he concoct a lie that\Npeople would see through right away?
0.5;Say, is there an instant camera\Nin the house anywhere?
0.5;...cut out the drawers with\Nsword cuts that don't connect...
0.5;And besides, how do you\Nexplain the dragon carving?!
0.5;The phone call that\NAkutsu-san swore he made...
0.5;But Akutsu-san's message\Nwasn't on the tape!
0.5;Maru-san said he was meeting\Nsomeone between 4:00 and 5:00,
0.5;The real reason for cutting up\Nthe room was to conceal something!
0.5;Finally, 5th row, 2nd column and\Nthe 4th row, 3rd column from the left.

0.5;"Could you write your name and \N""I'm sorry"" in this notebook?"
0.5;Why did you suddenly disguise \Nyourself as Azusa-san?
0.5;I see. So the culprit could have \Ntaken this sickle at any time.
0.5;Even I know that, but the real problem \Nis what lies beyond this fence.
0.5;The fluorescent light suddenly shattered, \Nand all the balloons we put up popped.
0.5;D-Did Hattori-kun really say \Nthat to the investigator?
0.5;He was very generous towards his customers, \Nso I think they probably liked him.
0.5;Yes. Koyanagi-sama comes only occasionally, \Nbut Nakama-kun stays all the time.
0.5;Come to think of it, they were \Nboth here that day one year...

0.5;...when he tried to chase\Nafter the kamaitachi?
0.5;the police would prove for you that \Nyou couldn't have committed the crime.
0.5;but word had spread that \Nshe'd been fired from here.
0.5;Because her hatred was driven \Nby her mother's chapped hands.

0.5;The second voice occurred just \Nbefore Imazu-san appeared.

0.5;I know why your testimonies \Nwere all different.

0.5;and of average height just a \Nlittle taller than the professor.
0.5;That means the culprit was an average \Nheight person slightly taller

0.5;Come to think of it, that does\Nsound kind of like me and Ran...
0.5;Don't be silly! It's only\Na model! See for yourself!
0.5;He was especially obsessive\Nabout Masked Yaiba, even among us.

0.5;He then locked the door,\Nbut fell lifeless soon after.
0.5;there were no blood marks\Nin the hallway.

0.5;Besides, she wouldn't have\Ndone that in front of a famous detective!
0.5;That's why she tried to stop her.\NBecause I was right there watching.
0.5;Harumi-san concealed\Nher sea snake in her pouch
0.5;She most likely taped the snake\Ndown in several spots in the pouch

0.5;If they were, all four in their group\Nwould've been childhood friends.

0.5;With everything lining up like this, \Nthere isn't any room for doubt, is there?
0.5;There should be someone coming and going \Naround the time DoDonPa-san arrived.
0.5;I can only imagine someone he was \Nextorting killed him to silence him.
0.5;the company you did a bodyguard\Njob for during that blackmail case?
0.5;And we'd like you to\Nplay a part in the advertising,
0.5;Well, I leave the rest to you.\NI'm going to have a look at her room.
0.5;It appears she broke the\Nwindow to get onto the veranda,
0.5;And sneaking in via the\Nchimney would also be impossible.
0.5;It was the wasps that killed her,\Nno question about it!
0.5;It's possible it was a murder\Nplotted by one of these people!
0.5;Some of the soot inside it\Nhas been rubbed off.
0.5;so President Yamazaki ran in\Nthe opposite direction, to the window.
0.5;It got stuck to a\Ntree branch downstream.
0.5;Only the caretaker here\Ncould have set all this up!
0.5;You also stuck fishing line\Nto a piece of tape on the bag
0.5;Yes... you had called her upstairs\Noffice to get her into the room.
0.5;but the light rain and wind\Nunfortunately got it stuck in a tree.
0.5;Speaking of which, I'm hungry!\NPlus we didn't go to the hot springs!
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;and you want to watch the girl you \Npoisoned out of desperation die?
0.5;used his phone's camera's zoom \Nfunction to identify her glass,
0.5;If more time had passed \Nsince she passed away,
0.5;their pointer finger away \Nfrom their chopsticks.
0.5;Unlike last time, you don't seem \Nto have brought anyone with you.
0.5;One handrail post by the front\Ndoor had a tiger sculpture on it.
0.5;All the digital clocks\Nhad a crack in the same spot.
0.5;It all seems to have been\Nset up to convey something.
0.5;And what came out of\Nthe cuckoo clock at 1:10...
0.5;The digital clocks and\NVCR all went off at 11:00...
0.5;The significant marks on\Nall of the digital clocks' panels...
0.5;Didn't you notice it while looking\Nfor animals around the house?
0.5;"And the cuckoo clock\Nrang at 1:10. Another ""110."""
0.5;It would've made more sense\Nto set the digital clocks to 1:10, too.
0.5;"""King"" in Japanese\Nstarts with the letter ""O."""
0.5;...but then what? Is there\Nyet another way to read 110?
0.5;"Did Monjiro-san know\Nanyone named ""Itou-san""?!"
0.5;Hey, Ran. Close the door\Nand shine the light through here.
0.5;"I figured I wouldn't\Ndiscover anything on my own."""
0.5;And then you showed up\Nat the perfect time,
0.5;But stolen goods are\Nstolen goods. I can't accept it.
0.5;Who's that person next \Nto you in the photo, dad?
0.5;You've been watching that \Ncustomer this whole time.
0.5;like bread or noodles, in the kitchen \Ninstead of interacting with customers.
0.5;Olive oil and miso are \Nan excellent combination.
0.5;...that suggested Kitami Saya's \Nsecrets were on her blog.
0.5;Besides, she and I have\Nnothing to do with each other.
0.5;This is a hangover,\Nif I ever had one...
0.5;Oh, yeah! I hear it gets a lot\Ndeeper really fast, so be careful!
0.5;Isn't it strange he didn't even\Nflinch after his girlfriend died?!
0.5;I heard something from\Nthe victim's friend on the beach...
0.5;Judging from\Nhis confident manner,
0.5;This incident was a murder!\NAnd the killer was you, Dr. Tanaka!
0.5;There's no doubt she died at\Nthe location Conan and Ran found her.
0.5;the inner tube could no\Nlonger support her weight,
0.5;Detective, please compare\Nthat photograph with Ran's feet.
0.5;Conan found a brand new inner\Ntube with a small hole on the beach.
0.5;But he said it was for an\Nacquaintance's daughter. How strange...
0.5;And you must've felt\Nquite confident about this trick...
0.5;If you think I won't kill a \Nkid, you're dead wrong.
0.5;We believe he's getting on \Nthe 4PM flight to Hong Kong.
0.5;And the fee you owe Utsumi \Nfor hiring him to kill me!
0.5;Utsumi died accidentally when he fell from \Nthe chimney while trying to kill Takatori.
0.5;Shimazu-san, could you \Nplease take off your socks
0.5;Why would I steal jewels \Nfrom my own jewelry store?
0.5;That and the jewelry store's \Ncircumstances that required it.
0.5;as he was forced to\Ncooperate with your orders,
0.5;If what I saw was on the roof, \Nthen the body's buried up there.
0.5;Are you saying one of them did it \Nand is trying to frame Manda-san?
0.5;You misappropriate them \Nfor your personal use!
0.5;He'd never get along with \Nthe slick Manda-san.
0.5;I think that old drama was \NYashiro-san's debut work.
0.5;I heard from Yashiro-san \Nthat she asked you to do it.
0.5;but if it's chosen, the \Nstation calls the listener.
0.5;you wrote a fictitious submission \Nthat would make Kijima Kumi-san
0.5;What do you want? It's \Nthe middle of the night.
0.5;However, Conan suspected \NInuyama-san and Kujirai-san,
0.5;You must've been unconsciously worried \Nabout the mark left there by your crime.
0.5;In her final struggle, Manda Towako-san \Nscratched the back of her killer's neck.
0.5;I never stood a chance \Nagainst the great detective.
0.5;You wouldn't have been able \Nto write it otherwise.
0.5;It had been seven years, \Nbut nothing had changed.
0.5;This old man doesn't have \Na concern in the world.
0.5;Oh, nothing! Let's just change\Nand hurry to the beach!
0.5;You're true lovebirds!\NIt's like you make a perfect pair!
0.5;I thought there would\Nstill be hope if he noticed.
0.5;He's probably back\Nat the beach, hitting on girls.
0.5;I'm so lucky to meet the great\NMori Kogoro-san in a place like this!
0.5;Your dear fiancée and sister\Nare bein' fooled, you know!
0.5;Besides, he seems to be a celebrity,\Nso you can't blame them.
0.5;What? I thought you\Nsaved her from drowning?
0.5;They sometimes show up\Non the Kuroshio Current.
0.5;I only remember well\Nbecause it was so shocking!
0.5;Someone held the snake and\Nforced it to bite her hand in the water!
0.5;There's no one crazy enough\Nto have a sea snake ready
0.5;It'd be more natural to think she\Nstarted to drown after she was bitten.
0.5;Yep! They're looking to\Nwin it this year too!
0.5;Even the principal?\NShuko sure has lots of school spirit!
0.5;Did you want this to be\Nan outside job that badly?
0.5;They're deciding whether\Nto call the police or not.
0.5;No, Kaji-kun isn't\Nthe one responsible.
0.5;go from the top\Nleft to the bottom right.
0.5;The flagpole is on\Nthe left, which means...
0.5;you were on the field,\Nthen cut the flag,
0.5;The tournament directors\Nsaw their passion for baseball.
0.5;Next episode's case takes \Nplace at a karaoke box.
0.5;I thought I could find that guy \Nand turn him in to the police.
0.5;"""You think the police would \Nbuy an excuse like that?"""
0.5;Takagi-san, the security \Ncameras around the station
0.5;But Detective Takagi didn't \Nmention anything like that.
0.5;But he believes he's the robber \Nand is running from the police.
0.5;I happened to hear about Ujihara \Nthe moneylender yesterday.
0.5;That's right! He's the one who \NUjihara was threatening yesterday!
0.5;People have called me \NGonta since I was a kid.
0.5;once we finish this job, they \Nsaid we'd be paid out generously.
0.5;While we were searching the \Ndepartment store for Genta-kun,
0.5;I saw two men transporting coolers that \Nlooked just like the ones in that car.
0.5;Those hand signals aren't the \NEuropean style of counting.
0.5;Because someone happened to \Nwitness Kaho-san jumping.
0.5;This morning I came to deliver \Nthe paper at the usual time.
0.5;I supposed we can cover \Nyour transportation costs.
0.5;Don't compared her to a \Ngirl who killed herself!
0.5;Oh, nothing. I just thought they \Ncould also look like a woman.
0.5;Ran-neechan's necklace \Nsparkle in the same way.
0.5;That proves you persistently followed \Nher around and watched her.
0.5;At the end of her rope, Kaho-san \Ncame to this bridge. And then...
0.5;But why were you so desperate \Nto protect Kaho-san?
0.5;Why did my daughter who wanted to \Nlive die, but this girl is alive?
0.5;There was a case the old man solved \Nbefore he was known by that name.
0.5;Do they want us to find the brooch \Nsince they hid it here somewhere?
0.5;He accepted everything I said \Nwithout objection, but...
0.5;Though I doubt the courts \Nor society would understand.
0.5;I can't believe a family \Nof cats ran into the road.
0.5;He told me to ask you \Nabout Nagakura Ryoji-san,
0.5;Did the two of you meet \Nat Dadagaya Concert Hall?
0.5;and planned to get married \Nat Hebunzaka Church.
0.5;Here, in his presence, I planned \Nto send you to hell!
0.5;Regardless of who it saddens, \Npeople who will act, will act!
0.5;I protected a young woman and \Nmade her turn over a new leaf!
0.5;I mean, he is a culprit, \Nbut not of this case.
0.5;They've got an elderly woman named \NIwabe Sayuri-san at Beika Bank.
0.5;I-In other words, it's unrelated \Nto the kidnapping?
0.5;It's likely the kidnapper \Nis already in the park.
0.5;You're under arrest for the \Nkidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan!
0.5;Don't play dumb! You can't \Ntalk your way out of this!
0.5;The kidnapper first had a hired man \Njump into the river to distract you.
0.5;If after that, someone attempted to steal an \Nold man's bag, naturally you'd look at that, too.
0.5;That man knew that someone \Nwould fall into the river
0.5;You're under arrest for the \Nkidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan.
0.5;they learned that both the drowning man and \Nthe man who attempted to steal the money were,
0.5;Besides, I don't know \Nanything about the victim.
0.5;Then wouldn't they take \Nit into the mountains?
0.5;Something suspicious was just \Ndiscovered at Shibahama Park.
0.5;This document was created \Nafter 10PM last night.
0.5;Since there was no need to work \Ntogether, they probably acted alone.
0.5;No, there must be some reason they \Nhad to do both of those things.
0.5;That bogus fortune teller \Ngot what was coming to her.
0.5;I got my fortune told because I \Ncouldn't make a decision on my own.
0.5;Waiters dressed like aliens \Nbring your ramen to you
0.5;I'm detective Mori Kogoro, and I'm \Nassisting with the investigation.
0.5;Easily flattered, drunkard, \Nand irresponsible...
0.5;Conan! There's only four cedar trees.\NIs this the right place?
0.5;Let's hurry before\Nthey beat us to it!
0.5;If it's not a W,\Nthen maybe an M...
0.5;It doesn't appear to have\Nbeen moved for a long time.
0.5;The man down there\Nsaid to give you this.
0.5;but someday it will\Nbe an obvious treasure--
0.5;I never expected to\Nsee the Professor's camp
0.5;Yes. He couldn't afford to\Nrelease it as it had been stolen,
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;He faked his death\Nduring the first incident,
0.5;then attacked Fujisawa-san\Nwith an ice pick
0.5;so that it would cause a\Nshort if someone were to plug it in.
0.5;There were three other people\Nin the kitchen besides me--
0.5;The third incident in which\NFujisawa-san was attacked
0.5;Yeah! When Kudo showed\Nup during that previous incident,
0.5;At any rate, what I don't\Nunderstand about the first incident
0.5;he was long dead\Nand rigor mortis had set in!
0.5;Thirty hours after that,\Nunder the best circumstances,
0.5;In other words,\Nsometime before dinner,
0.5;She did say that Ayako-san was\Nloitering in the hall in the afternoon...
0.5;Say! What would\Nhappen to the rigor mortis
0.5;and a certain function of the car,\Nit would become possible.
0.5;and the brakes would have\Nkept the car motionless
0.5;Naturally, there were\Nno water marks to be found.
0.5;That's why the killer sent\Nthe owner over the cliff in the car!
0.5;Ayako-san used a\Nlighter to look for the book!
0.5;and the garage trap\Nwound up killing Ayako-san.
0.5;and then attacked\NFujisawa-san with an ice pick!
0.5;It doesn't matter what she saw!\NShe can't talk now--
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;He said a lot of suspicious things, \Nbut it was all to catch the culprit.
0.5;I just bought that at the toy \Nshop in front of the hotel.
0.5;they've been competing for popularity \Non their blogs because of a TV show.
0.5;There's something I want \Nto discuss about her.
0.5;that suggested Kitami Saya's \Nsecrets were on her blog.
0.5;I was asked to take care of her until \Nher manager gets over her cold.
0.5;But is it true that the key card was here in \Na hotel without automatically locking rooms?
0.5;Since then, she stopped inviting \Neven acquaintances into her room,
0.5;But I had no idea that \Nthis had happened to her.
0.5;I can't believe they set you up in \Nthis huge room while you're filming.
0.5;I was just thinking yours is really \Ndifferent from Kyona-san's.
0.5;And even when she's in \Nthem, she's really small.
0.5;You'll see how she entered the room \Nif you look through the peep hole.
0.5;The head that had a woodpecker's \Nfootprint pressed into its forehead
0.5;resented Lieutenant Kano \Nwith Inspector Takeda.
0.5;He had his finger up to \Nhis forehead for a while
0.5;Yeah, with the big toe of his right \Nfoot that barely survived the fire.
0.5;Sorry, but he and I just \Ndon't seem to get along.
0.5;After all, the e-mail wasn't sent \Nfrom Inspector Yamato's phone.
0.5;then I don't think he'd \N leave a phone that would
0.5;serve as evidence without \Neven looking for it.
0.5;That's what they said about you \Nat the station, Edogawa Conan-kun.
0.5;Yamato's fingerprints were found \Non the rope used to hang Kano.
0.5;It's proof that he used \Nthat rope to strangle Kano.
0.5;Let's head back to headquarters \Nand hold an investigation meeting.
0.5;Come to think of it, he did \Nthe same thing the other day.
0.5;Inspector Morofushi and Akiyama-kun \Nwere crouching near the body.
0.5;I'd like to go check it out, \Nbut no cars are available.
0.5;Although smaller, my mind remains\Nthat of a sharp detective!
0.5;I'm sure the cat will\Ncome back eventually!
0.5;These kids say they saw\Na dead body in your house.
0.5;Approximately 15 minutes have passed\Nfrom the time you called us
0.5;Come on! If you're going to sleep,\Nat least turn the TV off!
0.5;I believe I've shown you\Neverything I can...
0.5;Neither we nor the police\Ncould find the corpse...
0.5;Hurry! Something bad might happen\Nto Conan-kun if you don't hurry!
0.5;You entrusted our company with your precious \Nmoney after signing a contract with us.
0.5;Nozomi. I'm almost finished \Nwith work. Wait outside.
0.5;President Tsuchida, do your \Nactions not violate the law?
0.5;In other words, he was \Nrunning an investment scam.
0.5;She was the girlfriend of the \Nother victim Kajiura-san.
0.5;This is Kitamura Mitsuru-san, the \Nproprietor of Kitamura Hardware,
0.5;I heard they were related to President \NTsuchida's goldfish investment.
0.5;But I was waiting for Yuto-san at \Nthe convenience store parking lot
0.5;we heard you were borrowing money at a \Nfriend's house when the murders took place.
0.5;After entering the company's office, \Nthey first headed to the main office.
0.5;If Kajiura-san was attacked by and fled from \Nthe culprit leaving the president's office,
0.5;he should have collapsed \Nin the opposite direction.
0.5;Yes. In the main office was a small \Ntank in addition to the large one.
0.5;Schedules are\Nthe basis of judgment!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;Where're we going?\NAren't we getting on this?
0.5;at Hana-no-Machi\NStation anyways...
0.5;I'm gonna sleep for an hour\Nuntil we get to Hana-no-Machi.
0.5;Thank you for using\Nthe Yu-no-Yama Line today.
0.5;Please look around once more to\Navoid forgetting anything onboard.
0.5;It's an honor to meet you,\NDetective Mori!
0.5;So the crime took place between\N10:50 and 10:52 or 10:53.
0.5;It's clear that you and the\Nvictim were on different trains
0.5;Hey, Ran.\NCan I see the train schedule?
0.5;If he had transferred\Nto the Hana-no-Machi Line...
0.5;Hey. Sounds like I'll\Nbe held up a little bit longer.
0.5;If you forgot something,\Nthen ask Ran!
0.5;Dr. Date and Dr. Sato.\NPlease come as well.
0.5;We didn't see him again until we\Narrived at Hana-no-Machi Station.
0.5;How could I have\Npossibly transferred trains?!
0.5;you turned your\Nreversible jacket inside-out
0.5;If you didn't transfer,\Nthen it should have a stamp.
0.5;Sorry, but I can't waste\Nany more time here.
0.5;the victim bought canned\Ncoffee from the onboard vendor.
0.5;No question about it!\NThis was a murder, not an accident!
0.5;In addition to setting up checkpoints, \Nwe'll reinvestigate yesterday's case.
0.5;No matter how you look at it, you're \Nclearly not my dad or brother.
0.5;If you don't want to die here and \Nget torn apart by stray dogs,
0.5;I was going to use it to climb down into \Nthe chimney, but now I don't need to.
0.5;That person was currently one of the most \Npopular kabuki actors, Ichikawa Ebizo-san.
0.5;I can't sit in the hospital \Nwhile the rest of you work.
0.5;In that case, why would \Nhe contact Takahashi-san?
0.5;Haibara Ai, a member of the Detective \NBoys and Edogawa-kun's adviser.
0.5;You went to the theater during \Nthe night, didn't you?
0.5;Today at 3:05, did you \Nreceive a call from Kaneko?
0.5;Weren't you in a meeting at \Nthe Beika Hotel at that time?
0.5;The attempted murder of Hosoo-san, \Nthe stolen two-faced mask,
0.5;If you hadn't stopped him, he would've \Nheaded straight into the crossing.
0.5;Yeah. Kogoro-no-ojisan asked \Nme to have you investigate it.
0.5;Neither of you were\Nthreatened by Kaneko-san.
0.5;But Kaneko-san's camera also \Ncaptured what happened next.
0.5;You can see how it's the\Nsame road at the same time,
0.5;This is a shot of you picking \Nup Iwami-san's note.
0.5;He'll suddenly act like he read your mind,\Nbut he won't explain how he knows.
0.5;and bought a magazine because \Nyou were in a good mood.
0.5;But in this area, model scouts only hang \Nout around the main street of 3-chome.
0.5;There are fast food \Nrestaurants on that street,
0.5;But since you want to eat at \Nthe café here, that's out.
0.5;The supermarket on that street\Nhas great prepackaged foods,
0.5;Red blood cells contain a protein that \Ncarries oxygen called hemoglobin.
0.5;They head to the crime scene \Nwhen they smell blood.
0.5;He carefully withdrew the blade from under \Nhis jacket so blood wouldn't spill everywhere.
0.5;He hit him with the stun gun while he was \Nleaning down and knocked him unconscious.
0.5;The receipt lists one coffee and one tea,\Nso he must have been with someone.
0.5;the smell on his shoulder must come from \Nthe perfume on her earlobes or hair.
0.5;so based on the location of the perfume, \Nthe woman is about 165 centimeters tall.
0.5;Since it's likely she wore high heels to her \Ndate, subtract five to eight centimeters.
0.5;So, did you check the\Nconvenience store angle?
0.5;Then this door... was unsealed\Nfrom the very start?
0.5;Masayo-san most likely knocked\Nher sister out with sleeping pills,
0.5;...she forcefully\Nopened the sealed door...
0.5;Incidentally, Masayo-san.\NIt was also you who sent your sister
0.5;You can quibble all you want,\Nbut fantasy is still just fantasy.
0.5;"Wh-What is? What's ""just as\Nyou thought""? Just come out with it!"
0.5;that came with\Na CD released yesterday?
0.5;Until I saw the logo on the key\Nholder and the blood stain on the door
0.5;Yes, take me down\Nto the station or wherever.
0.5;But, one day, after it\Nstarted to get on my nerves,
0.5;because you have more\Npride than most people!
0.5;your sister went to\Nget a different detergent.
0.5;I dunno why, but he's\Nsmiling while he's sleeping.
0.5;He must be having a dream\Nwhere he made it to the concert.
0.5;We might be able to stop it if we chase after \Nit with the sirens on the patrol car sounding.
0.5;"The word ""seal"" was written \Nalong the opening on the back,"
0.5;You're no different from that evil \Nwoman who stole Taiko's spine.
0.5;Instead, I suffered a thorough \Ndefeat at his hands.
0.5;But Master Taiko is currently \Nstruggling in the championship match.
0.5;It's probably because of \Nthe registration form.
0.5;since he still hasn't received a response \Nfrom the person dearest to him.
0.5;you should be able to \Nfind an envelope or two!
0.5;after he began eating \Nshortcake during his matches.
0.5;In other words, the second should \Nbe as easy to find as the first.
0.5;Yoko-chan played an extraterrestrial \Ninvestigator on TV the other day,
0.5;so I rushed up the stairs \Nand looked for it,
0.5;Shibuya-sensei is a teacher \Nat Haido Elementary School.
0.5;We can go, but I'm not sure \Nwe'll be able to get inside.
0.5;There's a police car parked \Nin front of the rear gate.
0.5;Are you sure that's not part of a \Ncon to sell you useless supplements?
0.5;He was lying face down with his \Nface pressed into the concrete.
0.5;and a bag containing rocks \Ncan only be thrown so far.
0.5;He said there was a bright light \Nand he lost consciousness.
0.5;It all begins with a letter \Nwith dancing characters!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;And beside him is the world's \Ngreatest writer, Yashiro-chan.
0.5;So, Mori-chan, you got any \Nalcohol in your system?
0.5;Mori-chan, we'll be heading \Ninto the studio now.
0.5;"""I don't know what to \Ndo about the crazy woman"
0.5;It makes you angry because \Nyou think of her as human.
0.5;heard the show on the radio \Nand recorded it onto a CD.
0.5;You're making it sound like I'm somehow \Ninvolved in her murder. Right?
0.5;You're the one who put this in \NKijima-san's mailbox, weren't you?
0.5;of the broadcast but copied \Ndirectly from the source.
0.5;That's how he made someone \Nelse do the killing.
0.5;He looked through the script I \Nbrought in as a total amateur.
0.5;You only think of your programs \Nas tools to make yourself rich.
0.5;It's true that they don't \Nget along with Manda-san,
0.5;by her husband and suspect \NManda Teruomi-san...
0.5;you're under arrest for the \Nmurder of Reigan Yutaka.
0.5;Wouldn't the forensics team have \Nnoticed if the body had been moved?
0.5;It's strange that he stayed \Nthere for an entire hour.
0.5;I looked for your money, but I couldn't \Nfind it, so I've been waiting.
0.5;She seemed to have it together, \Nbut she's an old woman.
0.5;Damn it. If only I hadn't \Nslept so deeply last night.
0.5;After entering Hide-san's \Nhome at seven o'clock,
0.5;In other words, Maihama blindfolded Hide-san \Nnot to confuse her about the time,
0.5;Conan's logic is good medicine\Nfor hearts tired by modern society!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,

0.5;Dry yourselves off. You'll \Nfilthy up the cabin.
0.5;Yes. Come inside, already!\NYou'll catch cold!
0.5;What do you want?\NWe're in the mountains.
0.5;Police and fire departments have\Na 50-man team searching the area.
0.5;The Fox is in this room.\NAnd he's the one behind these murders!
0.5;However, the next day, Red Shirt \Nwas found hanging from the neck,

0.5;I'm not sure, but it's possible \Nthat a third party was involved.
0.5;To do that, it was best to \Nmake it look like a suicide,

0.5;You can make your girlfriend's skin \Nlook darker by using a dark foundation.
0.5;Then you pressed the non-permanent marker \Nside of the file onto your cheek.
0.5;Now it looks like the words \Nwere written on your cheek.
0.5;that there was a suspicious \Nwoman stalking you.
0.5;She's Teitan Elementary School Class \N1-B's assistant homeroom teacher.
0.5;Do you not care if you never get \Nto eat Amuro-niichan's cake again?
0.5;but when she learned she lost the strap, \Nshe became extremely disheartened.
0.5;Crouch in front of the \Ndoor and breathe on it.
0.5;Are you looking for someone \Nelse by the same name?
0.5;Then maybe he's been following us \Nthis whole time so he could swipe it!
0.5;another person asks to \Npurchase the display product.
0.5;As long as you guys keep \Nshouting, eventually...
0.5;They seemed to be looking for \Nthe same strap for some reason,
0.5;If we'd known, we would've \Nhelped you look for it.
0.5;You don't know anything about a man \Nnamed Kusuda Rikumichi, do you?
0.5;Yeah. Everyone loves their beautiful \Nteacher who returned from abroad
0.5;Her history showed you called \None hour before it was reported.
0.5;She made it through surgery, \Nbut she's still unconscious.
0.5;on her way home from work,\Nand was pushed down the stairs.
0.5;There were a bunch of answer \Nsheets inside her bag.
0.5;...because I thought she'd be \Nready to go, she wasn't here.
0.5;Unfortunately, I saw them from inside \Nmy car, and they fled immediately.
0.5;The investigation would've \Ngone more smoothly.
0.5;Of course I only left after \Nthe ambulance arrived.
0.5;It looks like we're the \Nonly ones who noticed.

0.5;The case is solved\Nnicely in the fresh air!
0.5;It would appear you have quite\Nthe observational skills, Nose-san.
0.5;Meaning you can use both.\NYou're a switch-hitter.
0.5;Mori-san. You'd make a\Nbetter novelist than a detective.
0.5;Dad! You don't need to\Nbe so disparaging like that!
0.5;She didn't bleed very much,\Nso this must be someone else's!
0.5;it appears to have been\Na simple robbery-murder.
0.5;And he was also the one who murdered\NSaegusa-san, his accomplice.
0.5;So he panicked,\Nand had a falling out with her!
0.5;Oh, Gramps? This is Hirai.\NI'll be staying again tonight!
0.5;That's right, now that you mention it.\NThat old man had pale skin.
0.5;But to my surprise, the old man\Nhe had hostage pushed him and ran!

0.5;The Mystery Sinking in the \NMidsummer Pool, Part One!
0.5;Wasn't she looking for \Nher necklace in the pool?
0.5;It's possible she had some kind of \Naccident while wearing the heavy weights.
0.5;We split up to search, so \NI doubt it was possible.
0.5;Besides, the receptionists at the counter \Ncheck everyone who enters and leaves.
0.5;There were a bunch of glass \Nshards at the bottom.
0.5;There was a long fishing line \Ncaught in the pool's drain.
0.5;You could loop the end and \Nattach some glass shards.
0.5;Yes. She's even kicked out guests with \Na reservation to stay in that room.
0.5;I see you guys in movies \Nand TV shows all the time.

0.5;For the parts sticking out, we stuck \Npieces of cardboard to the sheets

0.5;And I used the same tape \Nand pen Masuko-san had.

0.5;You no doubt threw the knife you \Nused to kill Someji-san in the lake,

0.5;Yes. Kohei-san is waiting \Ninside for all of you.
0.5;But he had enough to get \Ndrunk and fall asleep.
0.5;Isn't it possible that Kajiki-san's \Nphone was on the ground near the railing
0.5;She used an illusion to make \NKajiki-san trip and fall.
0.5;He might accept it as the truth \Nwithout thinking too hard about it.
0.5;And could we examine your handkerchief \Nand the inside of your house?
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,

0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;What are you planning\Non doing to Yoko-chan?
0.5;from foreign countries\Nthat I'd never seen before.
0.5;So you never got in touch with the owner\Nwhile you were at the restaurant?
0.5;The storeroom has rows of\Nshelves and plenty of blind spots.
0.5;Now you just have to pull \Nout the owner's shoes
0.5;around the holes in\Nthe blanket and clothes.
0.5;but that's only if Yamada-san \Nwere a real sommelier!
0.5;they were the cigarette \Nbutts of two different men.
0.5;they were left by staff \Nmembers and not customers.
0.5;You tricked Banba-san and Konoe-san\Ninto thinking the owner was sleeping
0.5;and threw away the vacuum bag and\Nphone you'd been hiding in your jacket.
0.5;One of our former teachers from when\Nwe were high school students is retiring.
0.5;My shoes and tranquilizer watch \Nare both out for repairs!

0.5;than the great, modern-day\Ndetective that compares with
0.5;Placed throughout\Nthe lodge to watch over you
0.5;He drove off the cliff just\Nnow before our very eyes!
0.5;That can't be!\NWhy would he do that?!
0.5;What kind of trick the killer\Nused to speed the car up is a mystery,
0.5;Whatever the case,\Nthe killer is in this room.
0.5;Are you crazy? The killer might\Ngo after you if you're all alone!
0.5;At any rate, the fact that\Nshe's suspected of cheating
0.5;that those security\Ncameras were mock-ups!
0.5;We'd like you to\Ntell us who the killer is!
0.5;No, there is one person who\Ncould have done it!
0.5;As if I'd ever mistake\Na person for a dummy!
0.5;We don't know that,\Nso that's why we're--
0.5;I'm tired from staying up all night,\Nnot to mention hungry...
0.5;And it's because\Nof detectives like you
0.5;Where is he when your\Nold man starts analyzing?!
0.5;I was thinking the same thing, but \Nall I remember is her snaggletooth...
0.5;but unlike the numbers and letters next to \Nit, it was written with a water-based pen,
0.5;Huh? There's something written \Non the next page, too.
0.5;Maybe they're the code numbers of a drug\Nsmuggling organization's members.
0.5;You followed the location of my detective \Nbadge using those spare tracking glasses.
0.5;so he's the one who wrote \Nthe water-based ink notes.
0.5;That means the codes written in permanent\Nmarker were written by someone else.
0.5;G11 is the Ginza Line's \Nstation 11, Nihonbashi.
0.5;in the location of the \Ncircled letter or number?
0.5;"The first letter is \Ncircled, so it's ""ni."""
0.5;"The second number's circled, \Nso it's ""bashi."""
0.5;It's a code using line and\Nstation numbers, huh?
0.5;If there are stations in Osaka \Ncalled Nihonbashi and Kyobashi,
0.5;What Osaka stations are the N11 \Nand Y12 that come after that?

0.5;Even if each bag contained only 500 \Ngrams, four bags makes two kilograms.
0.5;The street value is a \Npretty significant amount.
0.5;I left the bathroom right away, \Nbut I got lost on the way back.
0.5;"Maybe it's because the character \Nfor ""de"" in Dekuri is formed"
0.5;"of the graduation project \N""The Fighting Red Tengu"" is based on."
0.5;That's when he found a self-published \Ncomic Dekuri had produced.
0.5;"It was ""The Fighting \NRed Tengu,"" wasn't it?"
0.5;Actually, there's something I wanted \Nto discuss with him in person.
0.5;I heard some tengu were running \Nwild on Kiyamachi Way,
0.5;she said Nishiki-san and \NMayama-san changed their names
0.5;There were also marks left by the \Nchair when Agata-san fell out of it
0.5;In any case, since a new cipher was found \Non the body of Ihaya-san yesterday,
0.5;"Seeing the words ""based on a comic by \NDekuri Michio"" on the big screen is my dream."
0.5;In order to get my revenge, I've \Nreturned from the underworld.
0.5;the beginning of the cipher \Nsent to Nishiki-san contains...
0.5;"""Suji"" from Kamigyo \NWard's Sujikaibashi-cho."
0.5;You used the notes Nishiki-san \Nused to revise the script.
0.5;If you screamed when you noticed the \Ntengu after lighting a cigarette
0.5;so only Mayama-san would \Nhear this horrifying voice.
0.5;Was your motive the absence of \NDekuri's name in the credits?
0.5;I thought so, too, but was perplexed \Nafter I checked with the staff.
0.5;We didn't tell you since you \Nand Dekuri were friends.
0.5;We changed our plans so \Nwe could meet up with you.
0.5;Seriously? He even had \Nyou waiting for a kiss.
0.5;We just received word that \NKudo Shinichi-kun of class 2-B
0.5;can't continue on the school \Ntrip due to urgent business.
0.5;but I kissed him like I was ready \Nto leap from the Kiyomizu butai.
0.5;I wish I could've stayed \Nwith you a little longer,
0.5;I had to stuff you into my bag while \Nyou were shrinking before my eyes.

0.5;He planned to tell her once \Nhe became an employee.
0.5;Inspector Megure, is it safe to assume the \Nsuspect was being blackmailed by Unmo-san?
0.5;Someone who makes such cute \Ndrawings couldn't kill a person.
0.5;The victim Unmo Sadakazu-san didn't \Nhave a particularly dumb face.
0.5;Yeah. Could you put Detective \NTakagi on the phone?
0.5;So they were out since before \Nhe arrived at the crime scene.
0.5;In other words, we don't know if she was \Nactually in her apartment after three.
0.5;Yeah, but she looks nothing \Nlike the tall man.
0.5;Take them back and have \Nthem examined immediately.
0.5;he told me not to underestimate \Nhim and started strangling me.
0.5;I attacked Unmo with the \Nmetal pipe when he returned
0.5;Today's case is a suspicious car!\NBe careful on the road!
0.5;He sees the\Nsingle truth for what it is,
0.5;Geez, you guys ate a ton!\NDon't any of you know what constraint is?!
0.5;What a bad road!\NThere's no pavement here!
0.5;Someone died there.\NIt was apparently a murder.
0.5;Which would mean it\Nreally was just coincidence...
0.5;Oh, Wataru did?\NHe was such a studious boy, too...
0.5;When the factory incident happened,\Ndid anyone call you by mistake?
0.5;Just as I thought!\NAs I recall, that alleyway had--
0.5;Say what?! Shishido Kenichi,\Nthe hit-and-run guy?!
0.5;Yes. Aside from the three\Nminutes the kids had lost sight of you.

0.5;It's possible the culprit \Ndidn't get much blood on him.

0.5;a tragic incident occurred near\Nthe cottage at the hands...
0.5;The victim is Masaie Hakuya-san,\Ntwenty-eight years old.
0.5;checked the water and when they entered \Nthe bathroom once they finished cleaning.
0.5;who was hiding in the kitchen \Nwhile Sumika-san, Ran-chan,
0.5;Together we only cleaned the first \Nfloor where the bathroom is.
0.5;She's the one who broke a window and\Nthrew a bunch of apples in here, too,
0.5;If we're dealing with a \Nghost, my bat is useless.
0.5;I also meant to use it to drive off whoever\Nwas pulling pranks on this rental villa.
0.5;It's not the weapon that was \Nused to strike the victim.
0.5;There seems to have been \Nsomething stuck on it.
0.5;Judging from the wound and \Nthe way the skull caved in,
0.5;I'm going to base myself in the United \NStates and work for three or four years.
0.5;Also, if you're going to cook, \Nmake my favorite paella.
0.5;That'll make it sound more like a \Nfolk tale and give it some weight.
0.5;The water for washing the \Nbrushes is pitch black.
0.5;Seems like she had business \Nwith Wakasa-sensei's neighbor.
0.5;I've only seen him a few times, \Nso I don't know him well.
0.5;Kurumi was supposed to come \Nto my place at 6:30 PM.
0.5;Come to think of it, she had a scrunchy on \Nher right hand like the woman in the photo.
0.5;What's their assistant \Nhomeroom teacher doing here?
0.5;Normally it stops immediately, \Nbut today it kept playing.
0.5;Come on, children. Let's \Nhead back to my apartment.
0.5;Conan-kun, have you already \Nfigured out who the culprit is?
0.5;It's hard to imagine someone could \Nwrite so clearly on their own face.
0.5;Wouldn't the last customer to rush \Ninto the shop be the culprit?
0.5;the three of them arrived \Nat roughly the same time.
0.5;Why do so many men with \Nround glasses like ramen?
0.5;But we're still upset about it, so we've \Nbeen investigating the three of them!
0.5;And I think Mizushina-san probably knew \Nwhen Tonda-san went to work, too.
0.5;Someone had gone through \Nthe dresser drawer
0.5;if you can solve this case \Nby the time the matches resume,
0.5;We were curious about this thing \Nthat was in the bag though.
0.5;if Hattori-kun fights, \Nhe'll win automatically!
0.5;Speaking of noises, I heard \Nrustling outside the bathroom.
0.5;I just wanted to inconvenience \NNukitani-sensei since he rejected my love!
0.5;If she was in a kendo club, she'd \Nknow how to put on a skirt.
0.5;Since that woman headed to \Nthe same bathroom as him,
0.5;I think you cross these long straps in \Nthe back, tie it in the front, and...
0.5;to make it look like the work of \Nsomeone with no kendo experience.
0.5;Is this what the victim \NNukitani-san actually said
0.5;In Kansai, a cutter refers to \Nwhat you call a dress shirt.
0.5;"In other words, he said, ""My nose bled on \Nmy dress shirt and I can't wear it anymore."""
0.5;This Hachidai Shrine charm's been \Nin my family for generations.
0.5;After winning his match, he noticed \Nit sticking out of his uniform.
0.5;While putting it back, he said he thanked \Ngod while holding it with tears in his eyes.
0.5;Mystery-solving logic will moisten\Nhearts dried by modern society!
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;Whatever. Let's go\Ncheck out the majestic Gomera.
0.5;They're all the ones\Nthat Gomera beat!
0.5;That can't be! There's no\Nplace to hide up here!
0.5;doing the final\Ncontinuity checks alone.
0.5;He couldn't have killed\Nhim with that leg...
0.5;When the incident occurred,\Nwhy where you here?
0.5;To think something\Nlike this would happen...
0.5;In other words, everyone but\Nyou three was in the screening room.
0.5;I told you, I don't know\Nhow this paint got here!
0.5;That's not enough time to\Ndon the suit, kill someone,
0.5;That's proof that Gomera\Nwent up the steps angry!
0.5;Wait a minute! In that case,\Nonly that person can be the killer!
0.5;how the killer\Ndisappeared from the roof.
0.5;Because Tomomi-san and Adachi-san\Nare lying to cover for the killer!
0.5;But the children saw his\Ninjury before the murder!
0.5;Are you really sure?\NTry hard to remember!
0.5;That's something that\NProducer Kamei made up.
0.5;Everyone'll have long forgotten\Nthat rubber freak in a year!
0.5;It was too hard after seeing\Neveryone working hard one last time...
0.5;There's one thing we\Nkept from the media--
0.5;This is the nation's biggest \Nhot air balloon rally.
0.5;but could you describe what \Nhappened when your wife fell?
0.5;A hot air balloon crashed into ours \Nand tore a hole in the envelope.
0.5;It's the balloon part on \Ntop of the hot air balloon.
0.5;Mister, you were fighting with Mizuguchi-san \Nbefore the race, weren't you?
0.5;So you got angry and deliberately \Nran into his balloon?
0.5;It looked like only one person was \Nriding in Mizuguchi-san's balloon.
0.5;I'm sorry for causing so \Nmuch trouble at your event.
0.5;At first I thought it got there \Nwhen you injured yourself.
0.5;But the blood was probably \Nyour wife Arisa-san's.
0.5;When you landed, in order \Nto destroy the evidence,
0.5;the second explosion was \Nsuccessfully avoided.
0.5;Yeah, but what if a bomb were to explode \Nat a location related to those?
0.5;Have the entire department begin \Nsearching for the bomb immediately.
0.5;and cash transport vehicles, \Nand stole a lot of money.
0.5;Like the previous riddles, the \Nthree fake bombs are trick answers.
0.5;The Megrez in Megrez Security \Nrefers to this star.
0.5;They said to come arrest the bomber \NHirukawa Takuji since they spotted him.
0.5;But it's all just speculation. \NYou have no proof.
0.5;No, the news didn't mention \Nanything about that.
0.5;to say once he learns he was \Nused and nearly killed by you.
0.5;for the author who passed \Naway before his time,
0.5;I thought he was acting on a\Nman's pride, but I guess it didn't matter.
0.5;I moved out so her fiancé\Ncan move in with her next month.
0.5;No, it's not! This wasn't\Na suicide! It was a murder!
0.5;Still, why would someone\Nslitting their wrist to commit suicide
0.5;Thank you! You've helped\Nsolve the mystery!
0.5;"So we can probably assume this\N""Goodbye"" was her dying message."
0.5;Conan-kun, want to come over\Nhere? I'll wash your back for you.
0.5;What's that? Why are\Nyou ordering me around?
0.5;And you've already seen what's\Nin there, but go ahead.
0.5;That's right. If she wasn't careful,\Nhe would hurt someone.
0.5;So you killed her because\Nshe discovered your identity?
0.5;Yes. On that night, he stole\N30 million yen from Beika City.
0.5;The flood bridge is about \Nto come out of the water.
0.5;Okay, let's head to the next attraction: \Nall the fresh seafood you can eat!
0.5;It could be, but it could \Nalso have been an accident.
0.5;Which means it's likely the body \Nwashed in through the flood gate.
0.5;They say she's a former \Ngravure idol or actress.
0.5;You can at least tell if it's \Nmurder or an accident, can't you?
0.5;Is this where you control \Nthe flood gate from?
0.5;The flood gate is opened and \Nclosed using this control panel.
0.5;He's been working at this \Npark since I was a kid.
0.5;but water skiing wouldn't \Nhave actually been possible.
0.5;How could he have washed in from \Nthe ocean if he died in the park?
0.5;Someone moved the body to \Nthe lake using Styrofoam.
0.5;He wanted to leave his last day \Nof work feeling accomplished.
0.5;And this is when he left. He's facing \Ndownwards so you can't see it.
0.5;You can clearly see his face, \Nand he seems to have a satisfied smile.
0.5;A man as kind-hearted \Nas me could never kill a man.
0.5;Were you really that rowdy \Nwhen you were a kid?
0.5;Yeah, I guess. Bad enough that \Nmy parents abandoned me.
0.5;You said you ran into \NKadowaki-sensei. Where was that?
0.5;I couldn't believe that happened \Nto that careful teacher.
0.5;It was the older brother Yuichi-san who was \Nabusing his mother Yasuko-san daily,
0.5;Th-There's no way. Even the police \Nsaid they weren't sure yet.
0.5;The final water taxi from Asakusa \Nto Hinode Pier is departing.
0.5;The old man turned him \Ndown, but the next morning,
0.5;He woke Tengan-san, who was \Nsleeping in the other room,
0.5;It looks like it was displayed \Nsomewhere else originally.
0.5;And then there's the location of the phone \Nhe used to call the police and Mori-san...
0.5;you were woken by Togawa-san and pretended \Nyou had just learned of your wife's death.
0.5;However, he's your partner \Nwho's been with you for years
0.5;Traces of fibers matching the ones found on \Nthe gloves were collected from inside the doll.
0.5;That woman is having an \Naffair with your apprentice!
0.5;For me, ventriloquism is as \Neasy as talking in my sleep.
0.5;We don't have any more time to be\Npart of your fruitless investigation!
0.5;Give me a break here,\NProfessor Agasa!
0.5;It's 'cause he's a high school student\Nplaying a detective
0.5;that I hardly ever\Nget any jobs anymore!
0.5;And look at all these fan letters!\NDetectives are popular!
0.5;No, nothing! We better hurry\Nor we'll miss class!
0.5;It's not fair if you\Nknew from the start.
0.5;in conjunction with a bit\Nof piano wire or some rope.
0.5;I got the horrible feeling that\NI'd never see Shinichi again...
0.5;Genta-kun, you're supposed \Nto kick it into the goal.
0.5;Shibata-san was fired for \Nembezzling company funds.
0.5;it's hard to imagine an injured \Nwoman could have pushed Shibata-san.
0.5;they killed each other after getting \Ninto a fight over money troubles?
0.5;hard enough to kill him \Nfrom a seated position.
0.5;Shibata-san was most likely dead \Nwhen you looked in the room.
0.5;No, the button flew into the \Npot while they were fighting.
0.5;The owner breathed in the\Nchloroform and went comatose,
0.5;The method behind Shiraki-san's\Nmurder and the other murder plot
0.5;She lost all hope in\Neverything and took her own life...
0.5;Keep hanging around this twerp\Nand you'll never fall in love!
0.5;we'll have dream-like\Nromances with them!
0.5;That reminds me, is one of their\Nfaces wrapped in bandages?
0.5;Alright, stop being a weirdo\Nand put your stuff away!
0.5;And last is our director,\Nscriptwriter, and club president--
0.5;I took time out of my\Nbusy schedule to be here.
0.5;I'd appreciate that,\NTakahashi-kun!
0.5;But I did see someone\Nstrange by the bridge
0.5;No problem!\NI always do this at home!
0.5;That's why I asked everyone here\Nfor a long-overdue reunion!
0.5;the gas switch and stuff\Nis in the backyard.
0.5;There! Now our room's\Nokay too, Conan-kun!
0.5;We might get to eat the teacher's\Nyummy French food for free!
0.5;And we get to eat the\Nfood you make at that table?
0.5;Making lots of money\Noff of others' ideas...
0.5;So what if she helped a little?\NThey're clearly your recipes!
0.5;Nishitani-san is skilled,\Nso she has nothing to say to him.
0.5;Wait a minute. The only way\Noutside is through the kitchen.
0.5;I'm sorry, but could\Nyou give me some light?
0.5;No one is to step\Noutside this classroom!
0.5;Yes. There was a red\Nspeck on her back, like a bug bite.
0.5;But that doesn't\Nrule out an inside attacker.
0.5;The attacker then\Nwent around to the front,
0.5;The instant it went out, they opened\Nthe door, leapt into the classroom,
0.5;"""The Cooking Classroom\NMurder Case (Part 2)."""
0.5;Even heaven is watching the \Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;a cerebral contusion caused \Nby a strong blow to the head.
0.5;After getting drunk, he probably slipped \Nand fell from his apartment's balcony.
0.5;Inspector, we should head \Nup to the victim's room.
0.5;when he tripped on the bottle, \Nfell over the railing,
0.5;and plunged straight down \Ntoward the ground.
0.5;Did you know Kitagami \NNaotsugu-san in room 704?
0.5;a man who employed extensive \Nanti-theft measures,
0.5;But there were no corresponding \Nscratches on his balcony.
0.5;Didn't he just get scratched \Non the ground when he fell?
0.5;However, throwing a person \Nover the balcony is hard work.
0.5;there was a big bag stuffed \Ninto the bathroom cabinet.
0.5;I-I was panicked when he found \Nthe jewels, but we made a deal.
0.5;Tear gas contains UV paint \Nso the person who used it
0.5;While he was writhing \Naround in unbearable pain,
0.5;I thought it wouldn't seem unnatural \Nif I threw him over the balcony.
0.5;she called her boss to suddenly \Nannounce that she was quitting.
0.5;So Kawaguchi Motoko-san suddenly \Ndisappeared from her home and workplace.
0.5;Suda-san, did you see Kawaguchi \NMotoko-san three days ago?
0.5;She jumped when you called \Nyourself a detective.
0.5;He's the mover who came to pick \Nup Kawaguchi-san's things.
0.5;It's like they're trying to push you as \Nquickly as possible to the conclusion
0.5;you erased Kawaguchi \NMotoko-san from this world.
0.5;At first Motoko-san was \Ndrawn to Toriumi-san, too.
0.5;If you made it seem like she'd \Nbeen murdered and her body hidden,
0.5;And once Motoko-san disappeared, \Nas you expected,
0.5;Once he reported to Toriumi-san that the \Ntwo of you made Motoko-san disappear,
0.5;You knew Kawaguchi Motoko-san wouldn't \Nbe able to answer the phone.
0.5;He'll know what it means \Nif I tell him that, right?
0.5;Difficult cases increase\Nin number as time progresses.
0.5;Tell us, what was the most difficult\Ncase that you've ever worked on?
0.5;Rumor has it you were\Ngoing to be replaced as host!
0.5;but there was no answer\Nwhen I called at 8:55.
0.5;I was on the air and I didn't\Nknow his cell phone number...
0.5;Oh? There aren't any\Ndownward stairs here!
0.5;And there's no blood\Non the window frame!
0.5;But why would the culprit call the person\Nhe was looking at and about to kill?!
0.5;How could he possibly\Nhave done it?!
0.5;The person who called the victim\Nright before he was shot
0.5;And for some reason I get sleepy\Nwhenever I'm around you.
0.5;but I was so moved\NI rushed right over here!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;He's even started to branch\Nout into heroic fantasy novels,
0.5;Great. I look forward to your\Nnew series starting next month.
0.5;Tadokoro, bring wine\Nand a movie to the study.
0.5;full of props and costumes\Nfrom vampire films.
0.5;His vast collection of props\Nand films are kept in here.
0.5;If anything, I'd say he's\Nprobably more into fantasy.
0.5;Why did the killer move the\Nprojector and light up the body?!
0.5;In short, the killer snuck in\Nand stole the stake
0.5;By going upstairs and\Nwalking across the corridor's roof!
0.5;Eight years ago, my father's\Nbusiness took a nosedive
0.5;was actually because of Dorakura's\Nbehind-the-scenes dirty work.
0.5;We plan to plant new trees\Nhere by the week's end...
0.5;But you didn't need to bring\Nme here just to ask that...
0.5;But lately, for some reason,\NI'm reminded of how lovely she was...
0.5;Yes, Nagato-san used to\Nbeat me down like a demon!
0.5;I'd appreciate it if you'd give me\Nthe title of president in return...
0.5;It's alright. I'll be leaving\Nhim in my place.
0.5;Mitsuaki-san!\NWhat's going on?! Mitsuaki-san!
0.5;It was still swaying when\Nwe checked around outside.
0.5;It's probably from the\Nknife or the fence he fell on!
0.5;After that, he quit school,\Nshut himself in his room,
0.5;Me and my old man figured it was\Na burglar scoping the place out,
0.5;That Mori Kogoro guy you\Nmade famous was here.
0.5;There was no need to drop the hat\Nor bandages, never mind the weapon!
0.5;If Hideomi-san drowned himself\Nin this pond before we arrived,
0.5;Inspector! I found this\Npaper in his pocket!
0.5;Which means someone\Nforged it or forced him to write it.
0.5;Either way, there's little\Ndoubt that someone drowned him
0.5;It's the married couple Chief \NDirector Hohoemi Waltz-san
0.5;This is the list of high-class \Nhotels Dubai we'll purchase.
0.5;I'm thinking about making Cosmic \NSmile Village Japanese style.
0.5;After all that time you spent, \Nthis is what you made?
0.5;We're unsuccessful because \Nof your incompetence.
0.5;Won't it be easier to make an \Nexcuse later if I come with you?
0.5;Just to be sure, you should \Nget checked out later.
0.5;I noticed someone with an \Numbrella jumped into the street,
0.5;Inspector, the ambulance \Ncrew found something.
0.5;Kikuchi-san, there are several \Nproblems with your testimony.
0.5;My memories were confused \Nbecause of the accident.
0.5;was forced to take a strange poison\Nby a certain organization,
0.5;My mind's that of a brilliant\N17-year-old detective!
0.5;What?! Are you sayin' you can't\Nbelieve what Ayumi says?!
0.5;Let me have a look at\Nthat piece of paper...
0.5;And the last O stands for otakara,\Nwhich means treasure!
0.5;Wow! I didn't know you could\Nread English, Mitsuhiko!
0.5;The treasure must be where the moon\Nand Tokyo Tower line up like this!
0.5;Could the moon symbol next to the tower\Nactually represent Moon View Street?!
0.5;If the person who wrote this was Italian,\Nthen the moon symbol...
0.5;We need to go back\Nto where we started!
0.5;"It's hard to think that the person\Nwho wrote ""gold"" in Italian"
0.5;The lights are reflected on the water\Nand make it look like a fish!
0.5;and set out in search of the coins\Nourselves, relying only on his code.
0.5;and explained everything\Nthat had happened.
0.5;Good for you, Conan-kun!\NYou've made a cute little girlfriend!
0.5;Darn it! There's still\Nsomething I want to ask you!
0.5;I said I liked dolphins, so he\Ninvited me to the aquarium.
0.5;The shark quickly cuts through \Nthe frame and disappears.
0.5;But wouldn't he notice if \Nshe put that in his hat?
0.5;took it off, inserted the \Nphone, and put it back on.
0.5;Since they're reversible, you've \Nflipped them inside out to hide it...
0.5;I'd like to wash that man's \Nblood off as soon as possible.
0.5;Though you erased them\Nwithout opening them.
0.5;Yes! He's one of\Nour company's directors!
0.5;I realized there's\Nalso a high possibility
0.5;Judging from this angle,\Nthere must be a camera on the roof!
0.5;But becoming a company\Npresident at such a young age...
0.5;But to our delight, the business\Ndid much better than we ever expected.
0.5;We also found this harmonica\Nlying next to the body...
0.5;It's clean, almost as if\Nit had been wiped with a cloth.
0.5;If it belongs to Fujii-san,\Nshouldn't his fingerprints be on it?
0.5;and was hit in the head by an\Niron girder on a construction site.
0.5;That's exactly the same as\Nwhat happened this morning!
0.5;Oh, a security camera\Non the roof is recording that.
0.5;Yes. The company president\Nis always checking the monitor
0.5;The reason being that I've\Nseen through the superb trick
0.5;So you're saying\NNakayama-san killed him?!
0.5;My sister always\Nsaw me as a father-figure,
0.5;Don't pull that prank anymore!\NIf my wife were to see it-
0.5;Please leave your\Nmessage after the tone.
0.5;With so many witnesses,\Nit must've been a suicide...
0.5;In which case,\Nthe most suspicious is...
0.5;A contact lens case.\NI assume it's hers.
0.5;She probably forgot she\Nwas wearing contacts.
0.5;But he was in\Nthe office when she fell.
0.5;A courier at exactly the same time\Nshe dies-- seems fishy to me.
0.5;Perfect! It's stuck on\Npart of the flowerpot!
0.5;We were all in that office\Nwhen we saw the lady fall!
0.5;one end comes undone and\Nthe victim falls by herself.
0.5;After taking the call from\NTanaka-san,
0.5;while Hanaoka-san\Nhad some on his finger.
0.5;Like I said, the best \Ndefense is a good offense.
0.5;Though I did recommend that we implement the \Nidea immediately once we came up with it.
0.5;and paid a huge sum for \Nthat one-of-a-kind jewel.
0.5;"""Tonight at midnight, I shall \Ncome to take the fairy's lip."""
0.5;There's even a card that \Nsays he'll pass this time.
0.5;I-If you want to stay, \Nthen it can't be helped.
0.5;In other words, if we press the button \None minute before the time he declared,
0.5;Then articles describing how I stopped \Nhis crime will be printed in newspapers,
0.5;because you're worried about \Nbreaking the container beside it,
0.5;This is footage from the \Nunderground casino's cameras.
0.5;Detective, does anything\Nseem strange to you?
0.5;There's no way someone like that \Nwould be working for the casino
0.5;making it look like the casino \Nemployees killed him instead.
0.5;The gunshots happened five seconds \Nafter the lights went out.
0.5;During a blackout, \Neveryone would be freaking out.
0.5;You were controlling it with \Na remote in your pocket.
0.5;I can't! I promised I would\Ngo alone and tell no one!
0.5;Ran-neechan! Let's go\Nto Kowan Wharf too!
0.5;I told him he'd never get away,\Nand that we should talk it over.
0.5;If my theory is correct, this was\Nno accident. It was a murder!
0.5;We've determined that his prints\Ngot there during the struggle,
0.5;Inspector! You told Teraoka-san\Nabout those fingerprints, right?!
0.5;There's a TV you can watch\Nin the spare room upstairs.
0.5;"This is all speculation;\Nyou have no proof."
0.5;As we waited for you to\Ncome back out yesterday,
0.5;At the time, I thought\Nshe was just worried
0.5;and continued to live\Nin constant uneasiness.
0.5;Then I got a call from him\Nat around 8:00 two nights ago!
0.5;You don't have any dangerous\Nstuff hidden, do you?
0.5;Dad! You have a clue\Nabout the kidnapper?!
0.5;Oh no! Once the kidnapper\Ngets the money, Keita-kun is--
0.5;Based on the gloves and \Nsneakers he was wearing,
0.5;The building is cleaned every \Nday at 7:00, 11:00, and 5:00.
0.5;Which means she could've\Nbeen here by 11:40.
0.5;However, he would be the prime \Nsuspect if he simply killed you.
0.5;At 11:40, Kanbayashi-san pretended \Nto go out to buy cigarettes,
0.5;Since it's the weekend, no \None would use the bathroom.
0.5;He finished the manuscript \Nbeforehand because he wouldn't
0.5;have time to write after he \Nwent out to commit a murder.
0.5;Kanbayashi-san didn't fail the\Njump because he made a mistake,

0.5;Once I have it in my hands,\NI'll return the girl.
0.5;I see. So, the first\Nkidnapping was a fake.
0.5;A trip to Australia, where\NAkiko has always wanted to go!
0.5;No, it's because of all\Nthe experience I've had!
0.5;I will express my gratitude\Nto you another day.
0.5;A Murder Behind the Locked Doors\Nof a Celebrity's Apartment.
0.5;The invisible relationship between \Na doctor and his patient.
0.5;Do you think he got in a \Nfistfight with the policeman?
0.5;Nowhere. He just told me \Nto follow the car in front.
0.5;Why aren't you investigating \Nthe bribery case?
0.5;The two of them fought here, and the \Nfreshly applied paint stuck to them.
0.5;There he ran into the Detective Boys as \Nwe were visiting various power spots,
0.5;and we began working together \Nto rescue Yumi-san.
0.5;Charging full speed ahead \Nwithout slowing the pace.
0.5;I see. So Fukushima Masanori's \Ngrave is up ahead.
0.5;I became unable to play\Nand hit rock bottom.
0.5;and the second was about \NShizugatake's Seven Spears.
0.5;There's something on the bottom \Nof the gold general, too.
0.5;With no clock time left, I thought \NYumi-san might be in danger.
0.5;...gluttony, lust, greed, sorrow, \Nwrath, sloth, vanity, and pride.
0.5;"The pierced bishop had ""show-off"" \Nwritten on it, so it's vanity."
0.5;High-handed is another \Nword for prideful people.
0.5;Even in the worst case scenario, we had \Nto know what that forward rook meant.
0.5;The kidnapper's probably desperate \Nfor Taiko Meijin to arrive.
0.5;Yeah. Until this point, the codes were \Nlabeled the first, second, and third game.
0.5;Come to think of it, where's \Nthat guy who kidnapped me?
0.5;He often travels for performances, \Nso he's not home much.
0.5;Entering without permission \Nis a crime, though.
0.5;because you were trying \Nto hide the pregnancy.
0.5;But I suddenly started bleeding the \Nday I was supposed to give birth...
0.5;Sure. After all, aren't you \Nthis child's big sister?
0.5;This isn't much, but it's a \Nreflection of how we feel.
0.5;I think he'd hate to lose \Nthat luxurious lifestyle.
0.5;The weapon is something much \Nthinner than a wine napkin.
0.5;And besides, Koshimoto-san \Ndidn't seem to know,
0.5;With everything that happened, \NI forgot to give this to you.
0.5;If you don't need those pamphlets, \Nfeel free to throw them away.
0.5;and we just happened to get involved \Nin the murder of her neighbor.
0.5;The curry won't be thick enough unless you \Nadd three more pieces of roux to the curry.
0.5;But you've been approached \Nby professional teams, right?
0.5;I see. You're going to lure \Nhim out with the smell.
0.5;It seems natural to me \Nthat we'd call the police.
0.5;when Wakasa-sensei first introduced\Nherself as our assistant homeroom teacher,
0.5;I wasn't sure whether to call \Nyou or violent crime's Megure.
0.5;And a little catalog of the \Nseries the figurine belonged to.
0.5;Besides that he had a wallet, \Nhandkerchief, and keys.
0.5;We heard something strike the roof, \Nso I headed to the back of the annex.
0.5;Not even a kid could fit \Nthrough a window that small.
0.5;and a little catalog of that \Nfigurine's product series, right?
0.5;I bought the capsule toy, \Nhoney, colored ball,
0.5;along with the capsule, \Nfrom outside the fence
0.5;You can't erase traces \Nof blood from your body
0.5;was something Hiyama put \Nhis underlings up to.
0.5;the water molecules permeate \Nthe glass, which weakens it.
0.5;And I don't want to cut \None of Fusae-san's cups.
0.5;You can't sell them because \Nyou're incompetent.
0.5;And this is our company's newest frying \Npan that utilizes that technology.
0.5;The man on the floor is R&D Chief\NKoshiro Masakazu-san. Is that correct?
0.5;You can't sell them because \Nyou're incompetent.
0.5;Since then, both the president and chief \Nwanted to take control of the company,
0.5;Which means Chief Koshiro committed suicide \Nover the guilt of murdering another person?
0.5;Yeah, even though they were originally \Nfriends who shared the same ambition.
0.5;Kogoro-no-ojisan had a question about \Nthat and asked to be notified right away.
0.5;Detective Takagi, what is the \Nstain in the president's office?
0.5;Before the new frying pan \Nwas tested this morning,
0.5;and swapped out the gas valve \Nfor the one they had modified
0.5;If you only intended to make \Nit look like a suicide,
0.5;and caused an explosion \Nto cover the evidence.
0.5;Both the president and chief \Nsaid the company would be ours
0.5;Today's case is animal protection!\NFolk tales have deep meanings!
0.5;He sees the single\Ntruth for what it is,
0.5;or we'll be sleeping\Nin the car tonight!
0.5;Are you really donating\Nyour estate to the village?!
0.5;And they used it all up?\NI'm so jealous...
0.5;It's your own fault\Nif you wind up fainting!
0.5;The window is locked, and the\Ndoor was locked from the inside?
0.5;And then the glass\Nshards fell to the ground...
0.5;The string left distinct\Nmarks inside the chimney.
0.5;He didn't say that in regard\Nto just them, but to you as well!
0.5;When you did, Conan caught\Nit and gave it back to you.
0.5;This is called glamping \Ninstead of camping, isn't it?
0.5;I thought the chef would be \Nsuspected if he had food on him.
0.5;Ma'am, why did you put \Na crab leg in his mouth?
0.5;Since then, he didn't even \Nlike to look at crab.
0.5;Publicly they acted like \Na happily married couple,
0.5;The wife was pretty bad, but the \Nhusband was a scoundrel, too.
0.5;Maybe that young woman was \Nthe president's mistress.
0.5;If you can't determine the truth, \Nthere's no point in us staying here.
0.5;Furthermore, each one of them abandoned \Nthe body in another suspect's room.
0.5;A person with an allergy would be \Ncareful to never eat that ingredient.
0.5;as long as you claimed not to know about his \Nallergy, it would be treated as an accident.
0.5;Those are the cookies you \Noffered this afternoon to—
0.5;Anyway, I can't believe \Nthey're making a kaiju movie
0.5;His movies have been kind of off for \Na while, but now we're getting this.
0.5;And wiped the blood from his pointer finger \Nso it would recognize his fingerprint.
0.5;But the cut is too small. I'm not sure \Nwe'll be able to identify the weapon.
0.5;You were Yonekura-san's \Nsubordinates, weren't you?
0.5;Which means the culprit climbed the scaffolding \Nand cut the rope holding the kaiju, right?
0.5;Yeah, but only Kosugi had \Nthe motive and opportunity.
0.5;Yeah. It seems Yonekura-san \Ntook a picture of the culprit.
0.5;and Kouchi-san helped Mihara-san \Nclimb the scaffolding from below.
0.5;They say that after his wife\Nand son moved out,
0.5;Nobody's been here for a long time,\Nso the floor's covered with dust...
0.5;Ghosts can't possibly exist\Nin this scientific day and age!
0.5;And then there's that secret entrance\Nthat was built out of plain view!
0.5;I thought that the killer\Nwas never caught,
0.5;It happened on a spring night\N5 years ago...
0.5;My mom made it look\Nlike a robber killed him
0.5;I want to confess my crime\Nso I can live with myself!
0.5;What was Kudo-kun doing here \Nso early on a Sunday morning?
0.5;If you continuously take it in order to remain \Nin your original body during the school trip,
0.5;Can't hear you hear the \Nsound of Big Ben over here?
0.5;Unfortunately, I need to \Nuse my car after this.
0.5;In other words, someone picked up \Nthe Sanada strap his son dropped
0.5;Why don't we think about that \Nonce we return to my car?
0.5;Maybe... They're on their way \Nto go swimming at the beach.
0.5;It's not unreasonable that his father \Nwould use Yaiba as an example.
0.5;Who asked for ice\Ncream in this weather?
0.5;His TV drama ended at 10:00,\Nso where could he be?
0.5;Damn you... This was\Nyour original intent all along...
0.5;Then let's hear each of your\Nalibis between 9:30 and 10:00.
0.5;It takes over forty\Nminutes round-trip!
0.5;Huh? But why isn't\Nthere any blood on the sofa?
0.5;Did someone put it\Nhere after the blood dried?!
0.5;Which only leaves Kanazawa-san\Nand Nakahara-san without alibis.
0.5;and then pretended\Nto leave in your car.
0.5;No, you know yourself\Nthat there's proof
0.5;Say, Dr. Oyama always said how\Na horse would make the full set.
0.5;Yes, the paper I wrote\Nfor my late father's sake...
0.5;was to prevent any\Nmore cases like my father's!
0.5;Excuse me. I'm unfortunately \Nout of business cards.
0.5;With a famous detective \Non the case, surely...
0.5;Nothing. I was just thinking \Nthis is like that other case.
0.5;The driver Shiomi's wife \Nand child were released,
0.5;In other words, White Spirits \Nis at KM North ST.
0.5;Today's case involves a\NJune bride dressed in white!
0.5;I called him but he said wouldn't go\Neven if his life depended on it.
0.5;That lousy woman did nothing\Nbut torture me for three full years!
0.5;Who in their right mind would miss\Ntheir boss's daughter's wedding?
0.5;Dad! What are you saying\Nat a time like this?!
0.5;You don't remember? That's Umemiya-san--\Nhe was one year ahead of us.
0.5;Huh? There's something\Nfloating in the lemon tea.
0.5;Come to think of it,\Nwe were recording a video!
0.5;Poisoning her favorite lemon tea...\Nhow horrible!
0.5;It was 1:46 when\NRan-kun called the police.
0.5;Now to match this voice changer\Nto Sonoko's voice...
0.5;You said that the perpetrator\Nput the poison capsule in her tea
0.5;Yes. And the only ones with her\Nat the time were Conan-kun
0.5;She could've survived if you had\Nrushed her to the hospital in your car!
0.5;15 minutes later, my mother died,\Nlying on the street.
0.5;She was really worried,\Neven after she accepted your proposal...
0.5;It's great that you got to leave\Nthe hospital earlier than expected!
0.5;do you know what kind of music \NHaibara's been listening to lately?
0.5;placed second in the high \Nschool championship.
0.5;But his favorite song isn't \Nlisted on his website.
0.5;We'll run a mobile recording \Napp and leave the screen black.
0.5;Teams Detective Boys and Café \NRenno, please get ready.
0.5;She's lying unconscious and in serious \Ncondition in a hospital bed right now.
0.5;I think I dropped something when I took out \Nmy handkerchief after using the bathroom.
0.5;If they tripped, they must \Nhave been in a hurry.
0.5;it makes sense that they \Nwould have gotten shorter.
0.5;Even if these were connected, the rope \Nwould just hang down uselessly, right?
0.5;to make it seem as though the \Nrope broke a long time ago.
0.5;Maybe the underside of the\Nrope wasn't bleached...
0.5;The rope attached to the post \Nnext to the one of the very end
0.5;People don't normally pay much attention \Nto what's behind them when they do that.
0.5;Hijikata Kozaburo-san, the historical\Ndrama actor, hired the old guy
0.5;While we were on the veranda,\Ntaking in the view,
0.5;of Okita Hajime,\Nwho lived next door!
0.5;Okita was home,\Nbut denies killing her.
0.5;And, given the old guy's personality,\Nit should be around here...
0.5;How do things look\Nin there, Takagi-kun?
0.5;I'll give you just\None hint! Now come close!
0.5;That'd mean Okita Hajime\Nwas clearly the killer!
0.5;And now to use this\Nvoice-changer to talk for him...
0.5;Yes, it would seem clear\Nthat Okita-san killed her,
0.5;How could anyone else have\Ncarried the body into his room?!
0.5;After he took me to his\Nfake room on the 6th floor,
0.5;He set things up so she would\Nfall onto the veranda at the right time
0.5;and, at just the right time, he used\Nhis cell phone's speed-dial button.
0.5;are from when she was\Nswung onto the veranda?
0.5;Inspector. Please confirm\Nwith Detective Takagi.
0.5;and I wanted the money\Nto rebuild my film studio!
0.5;Huh? That's odd. I'm certain I prepared\Na phone with the same sound.
0.5;"""The Case of the Mysterious\NBandit Mansion (Part 1)"""

0.5;The arrival of God's gift \Nto detectives, Mori Kogoro.
0.5;This is one of Japan's greatest \N20th century pear trees.
0.5;But I think we can overturn the story \Nthat the incident occurred at 1 PM.
0.5;I got a call later asking to re-deliver \Nthe parcel, so I delivered it again.
0.5;had Naomi bind her hands and feet, place her \Npendant under the sofa, and break the pot.
0.5;I know the situation you're in \Nbecause I've always loved you.
0.5;I thought it might be the \Nreport on Kotani-san's death.
0.5;He sees the single truth\Nfor what it is,
0.5;Ran, the old man, and I attended\Nthe Izu Mystery Tour
0.5;Plus she was with Ran and Conan\Nwhen they ran into the Night Baron.
0.5;He supposedly used the phone\Nfor online access until after 10:00.
0.5;I knew it! Those were\Nsleeping pills she had!
0.5;They're sure of it, because they\Neven checked their own watches!
0.5;Blankets that I had dressed up\Nas people and dropped from above.
0.5;But he fell directly\Nonto that statue!
0.5;It couldn't have been carried\Nthis far by the wind.
0.5;If he had been pushed\Noff his own veranda,
0.5;they were also traps to make it\Nlook like that's where it happened!
0.5;he locked it before committing\Nthe murder in his own room!
0.5;She has nothing to do with it!\NShe even ran into the killer...
0.5;happened to have the same\Nhairstyle, making it unnecessary!
0.5;To avenge my brother who he\Nmurdered three years ago!
0.5;but Detective Yokomizo says he may\Nget off on mitigating circumstances.
0.5;I only wanted the virus\Nso I could make a vaccine.
0.5;that ruined my beloved\Nsoftware 'son' four years ago!
0.5;Does he work at\Nthe game company too?
0.5;"""Cancel the show or else.""\NThis is a threat letter!"
0.5;There's something strange\Nabout that emblem!
0.5;Those are the number tags for\Nour things at the baggage counter.
0.5;why did they choose\Nthis place to make the deal?
0.5;Yet they knew for a fact that\Nhe would check the briefcase...
0.5;If we check the\Ncontents of something,
0.5;So he gave that briefcase\Nbomb to that large man?
0.5;The man then took Nakajima-san's\Nbriefcase from the baggage counter.
0.5;Because Takeshita-san had\Nmeant for that briefcase bomb
0.5;There was a good chance\NNakajima-san might notice later
0.5;She committed suicide\Nafter Nakajima dumped her.
0.5;Just that the place I met\Nthem at was always the same.
0.5;"A bar named ""Cocktail,"" on the\Ntop floor of the Daikoku Building..."
0.5;But letting it slip to the kid that your \Nnickname is “Zero” was a mistake,
0.5;When we looked at the coaster, \Nit didn't have a skull.
0.5;If I die, your secret will be \Nleaked to the Organization.
0.5;Anyway, did you figure out \NProfessor Agasa's psychic trick?
0.5;No. It's the name of a liquor \Nyou're very familiar with.
0.5;It flew without anyone \Ntouching the controller?
0.5;They look like the cake \Nbefore it melts, don't they?
0.5;In other words, it's \Nlikely something happened
0.5;Or else the culprit is \Nsomeone who has the key.
0.5;Car 227, there's a Mori-sama \Nat Beika Station.
0.5;The culprit was reflected \Nin the windows of the store.
0.5;reflecting the taxi passing \Nin front of the store.
0.5;for the several seconds \Nthe windows are fogged up.
0.5;With these, unlike cakes \Nthat are already frosted,

0.5;"The next episode of Conan is \N""The Real Culprit's Scream!"""
0.5;He's hardly fit to be a working \Nmember of society, don't you think?
0.5;I'm always telling you not to \Nwander around crime scenes.
0.5;None of the restaurants reported \Na customer wearing a cap.
0.5;When you opened the bathroom door, you were \Nshocked to see Kusano-san on the floor.
0.5;You clearly bore some \Ngrudge against Kusano-san.
0.5;This camphor tree is \Nhuge. I'd love to see it.
0.5;The truth is, the stockholders' meeting \Nscheduled for this afternoon at three
0.5;He probably assumed he'd take \Nover his father's position.
0.5;If we don't do something, it's \Npossible he'll hurt the director.
0.5;would only allow them to investigate it \Nas a case of vandalism and trespassing.
0.5;Where's the parking lot \Nwhere the president tripped?
0.5;Fukamachi-san looked surprisingly \Nsmall in that photo.
0.5;Izumi-san, do you have any idea \Nwhere Torahiko-san might be?
0.5;No. Personally, I'd very \Nmuch like to purchase them.
0.5;The victim was Sawada \NRyosuke-san, thirty-five years old.

0.5;This evening, he brought \Nthem to be appraised.
0.5;It was a match for the \Nhand cream on the weapon.
0.5;and bludgeoned the victim, the section \Nthe cream stuck to would repel water.
0.5;Hand creams are sometimes \Nused to prevent fogging.
0.5;He threatened to tell my husband \Neverything if I didn't give him more.
0.5;Whoops! I forgot to\Nleave his sketchbook!
0.5;Actually, the patient you\Nbrought in just disappeared.
0.5;Say, Inspector! The victim's\Npaint supplies are gone!
0.5;This doesn't seem like\Nany ordinary mugging to me!
0.5;Oh, yes! I have some nice\Ncookies! Just a minute!
0.5;He looks just like a murder\Nvictim discovered this morning!
0.5;Then it was someone else.\NMy husband supposedly died a year ago.
0.5;so it was assumed\Nhe disappeared with it.
0.5;Naturally, you removed all\Npossible fingerprints and hairs, too!
0.5;You even hired a cleaning\Ncompany to be extra sure!
0.5;Mr. Hayase, after regaining his\Nmemory and leaving the hospital,
0.5;stood in front of this painting,\Ncigarette in mouth.
0.5;Several ginkgo leaves\Nlikely fell inside then.
0.5;Because of the burn mark\Non the wooden cabinet.
0.5;No. That habit began\Nafter he lost his memory.
0.5;Before he got amnesia, Mr. Hayase\Nwore glasses for his near-sightedness.
0.5;I wanted to get my time,\Nand life, back!
0.5;I'm worried some thugs \Nmight try to attack her.
0.5;I, Mori Kogoro, will protect Risa-san with \Nmy life, no matter who dares to attack her.
0.5;No, it's probably a clue to the \Nidentity of the kidnappers.
0.5;Conan-kun is at the dock. \NGo pick him up immediately.
0.5;We believe it was the \Ndelusion of a maniacal fan.
0.5;There was a refrigerator in the \Nback of the recycling truck,
0.5;They used something to gag her, so she turned\Non her phone so we'd know where she was.
0.5;Sakuta-san, we've received a lot of requests \Nfor interviews regarding the incident.
0.5;And whenever it turns, something \Nbad always happens afterwards.
0.5;Since then he hasn't been \Ngoing to school or working.
0.5;My father will eat by himself \Nonce he's finished praying.
0.5;He's not a bad person, but \Nhe can be so stubborn.
0.5;So, what's the bad news Kannon-sama \Nhas warned you about?
0.5;Come to think of it, \NDad's taking a long time.
0.5;after the head priest left \Nto perform his duties?
0.5;It was stuck to the inner \Nleft side of the canopy.
0.5;He demanded you return the money, and \Nafter acknowledging that, you stormed out.
0.5;to prepare scriptures and \Nofferings could have done this.
0.5;I just wanted to scare him \Nand ask to end my training
0.5;There was rice powder on \Nthe edge of the table.
0.5;In other words, only the killer \Ncould have put the powder there.
0.5;He'd arrogantly complain \Nabout the smallest thing.
0.5;The Buddha only turned after heavy rain \Nor when there was a lot of snowmelt.
0.5;Only brothers could achieve \Nsuch impressive harmony.
0.5;After driving straight ahead for a while, \Nwe passed a rooftop park on the left.
0.5;Probably drum practice for \Nthe Ghost Chimney Festival.
0.5;The bank sends a collection \Ncar to come get it.
0.5;and the security guards go to the \Ngrounds to collect the money.
0.5;Damn! Their plan was to disguise themselves as \Nthe agents from the start and steal the money!
0.5;What a weird bird. Maybe\Nit had an anemic attack?
0.5;Say, I looked at\Nthe mail board earlier.
0.5;It was his wife, Takako-san,\Nwho found him. Correct?
0.5;when Mori-kun and\Nthe others came rushing in...
0.5;and there was trouble\Nabout the compensation.
0.5;What do I have to do with it?\NI wasn't in the building.
0.5;It's also possible that\Nshe didn't remember correctly!
0.5;that means they flew in\Nlike a bird to kill the victim,
0.5;The murder weapon\Nwasn't a flower pot!
0.5;Conan, that bird\Nfell down there, right?
0.5;What are you checking\Nfor in a place like this?
0.5;Hey! There's something\Non the ground here!
0.5;I absolutely couldn't\Nlet him get away with it!
0.5;Your detective work last\Nnight was amazing, Dad!
0.5;Did he actually\Nmake that fishing rod toy
0.5;This morning, a suspect being escorted and \Nthe officer escorting him have both gone missing.
0.5;Also missing is the MPD Section One \Nofficer escorting suspect Someya,
0.5;He just got a call and went \Ninto the changing room.
0.5;That's it! Someya called that guy \Nand the girl he was stalking.
0.5;The river runs fast in this area, so\Nshe may have been taken downstream...
0.5;No. I realized\Nit was a kidnapping
0.5;Pardon my rudeness, but you\Nare an infamous corporate raider.
0.5;She said that she was also\Nlike a mother to her,
0.5;Did anything out of\Nthe ordinary happen?
0.5;I don't want your lousy money!\NYou can keep it!
0.5;There's no mistake about it!\NThe kidnapper must've contacted him!
0.5;Even in the picture\Nthe kidnapper sent us,
0.5;my latest business\Ndeal will go up in smoke!
0.5;Yeah, by sucking the\Nlifeblood out of other people!
0.5;Corporate raiding is a\Nperfectly legitimate business!
0.5;Weak people lose! And the losers\Nhave no one to blame but themselves!
0.5;Please don't tell anyone\Nabout this, Conan-kun.
0.5;If the police found out, Naoko-chan\Nwould be killed for sure this time!
0.5;Once the deal is over,\NI promise we'll let you out.
0.5;Even if you did get revenge, I don't\Nthink your brother would be happy.
0.5;and the old man's lecture \Nconcluded without incident.
0.5;I just received word from \Nsomeone who found the codebook.
0.5;Finally, the last code is the \Nsame as the first, spelling KI.
0.5;The victim is Amagi Tatsuya-san, a \Nresident of a nearby apartment building.
0.5;We were paying dues to the \Nneighborhood association.
0.5;Didn't you spend days examining the \Ncontents of the storehouse, Chino-sensei?
0.5;But the storehouse was full \Nof old worthless junk.
0.5;So Chino used the fact that the \Nneighborhood association
0.5;Sometimes I'm asked to judge \Nsubmissions for a mystery magazine.
0.5;In other words, you have no \None to verify your alibi!
0.5;like putting poison in a bottle or \Nleaving the front door unlocked, right?
0.5;High school student Shinichi was forced\Nto take a drug that shrunk him!
0.5;We sure were lucky!\NI was worried for a while there!
0.5;It was a good thing this ship\Njust happened to stop at the island.
0.5;We had our ceremony this morning\Non Hatamoto Island,
0.5;Just what I would expect\Nof the man whom Natsue chose.
0.5;Maybe they're discussing some\Nunder-the-table business!
0.5;It would seem that 40 or 50 minutes\Nhave passed since Gozo's death.
0.5;If it was a suicide, then there's\Nsomething important missing here.
0.5;Yeah. I'm Zaiki Takeshi,\Nson of Zaiki Isao!
0.5;You decided to become a member\Nof the Hatamoto family
0.5;We're giving you to the police\Nthe minute we arrive in Tokyo tomorrow!
0.5;And eventually, you too will\Nbecome the Hatamoto Group's--
0.5;Who're you to talk? You left\Nthe family to go be a chef!
0.5;The sound of something\Nfalling into the water
0.5;was probably the sound of\Nthe killer hitting Tatsuo-san.
0.5;Your booze and lack of\Nexercise has gotten to you!
0.5;There are people here!\NAnd the media!
0.5;You sure you should\Nbe acting all big, Kijima?
0.5;Are you really fit\Nto boss people around?
0.5;Saijo-san took his\Nplace as team captain,
0.5;I know the tournament's soon,\Nbut don't go overboard, Saijo-kun!
0.5;T-That's right,\Nbut how did you know that?
0.5;Hmm, well, the police\Nwill be finished tonight,
0.5;Saeki Reiko,\Nblackmailed over tax evasion...
0.5;The problem is\Nthat old man's testimony...
0.5;I know who's\Nresponsible for this incident.
0.5;But that's nothing more than\Ncircumstantial evidence, Mori-kun!
0.5;Actually, if that witness were\Nto always look out the veranda
0.5;Yes. And it was that person\Nwho killed Saijo-san!
0.5;Competitive swimmers never\Nswim without caps, correct?
0.5;Putting a cap on to avoid suspicion,\Neven if no marks were left...
0.5;At the bottom of the platform\Nstairs is a painting the witness made.
0.5;That was done while\Nwatching tonight's diving practice.
0.5;Half a year ago,\NI caused a motorcycle accident
0.5;And it doesn't look like\Nhe's been home either...
0.5;Very well. I will investigate\Nas discreetly as possible.
0.5;Nobody's supposed to know\Nshe lives here, it's a secret.
0.5;And the person with you\Nat the time was...
0.5;Just because she has\Na key doesn't mean...
0.5;I'm not! I was in the dressing room\Nat the TV station.
0.5;Yuko Ikezawa-san.\NShe debuted the same time I did.
0.5;The question is how\Nto put them together...
0.5;he began working for\NKakubeni Corporation.
0.5;she wouldn't have told us\Nshe ran into him.
0.5;then stood up on a chair\Nand fell back onto a knife
0.5;Didn't you realize that the two of you\Nlook exactly the same from behind?
0.5;he was completely shocked\Nwhen she resisted him,
0.5;I can't even sleep at night\Nwith Shinichi gone...
0.5;From this day forth, we'll be known\Nas the Junior Detective Club!
0.5;who looked just like the\NMole Alien from Masked Yaiba.
0.5;He claimed that his missing\Nsister had been killed by Watanuki
0.5;After his request was turned down,\NKoda Masao left angrily.
0.5;And the robber was\Nnone other than Koda Masao!
0.5;Genta-kun! This is Mitsuhiko!\NDo you read me?!
0.5;Yes. The jewels I stole are\Nburied throughout Watanuki's yard.
0.5;Koda-san made them!\NThe jewels are buried in some of them!
0.5;Eh? You went to her company?\NDid you find anything out?!
0.5;Alright! This manhole\Nwill be the home plate!
0.5;I never would've agreed to\Nthis had Shinichi-kun not called me...
0.5;stopped by this house\Nafter work, just like she had said.
0.5;That night, there was a construction\Ntruck parked in the alley,
0.5;so the sound of a shovel digging\Nwouldn't seem suspicious to anyone.
0.5;but he said he'll take\Ngreat care of it, as if it were her.
0.5;You said you talked to\NShinichi on the phone, right?
0.5;and the Beika Hotel cake \Nbuffet ended yesterday.
0.5;Could I get a table instead \Nof sitting at the counter?
0.5;Now I understand how Haibara \Nand the old man felt then.
0.5;I still have a lot of other \Nmethods at my disposal.
0.5;What's wrong with reducing a \Nrival restaurant's patronage?
0.5;The current manager will be retiring when \Nshe gets married, and I'm next in line.
0.5;It sounded like you were \Nsecretly planning a trip.
0.5;We can't be bothered to unlock and lock it \Nduring business hours, so we leave it unlocked.
0.5;We knew about the staff-only \Nentrance since we saw it, but...
0.5;I came to the kitchen to provide some \Ncooking instruction at my sister's request,
0.5;The entire staff would've known \Nhe came here frequently to smoke.
0.5;After getting a taste for the compensation \Nhe received after the first incident,
0.5;perhaps he caused the panic himself \Nin order to receive more money.
0.5;that you hoped to suffer collateral damage \Nagain so you'd receive more money?
0.5;It wasn't a coincidence that Kagura-san \Nsuffered collateral damage yesterday.
0.5;You were sure to go to that \Nbank to withdraw the money.
0.5;preventing him from reaching \Nhis ultimate goal, right?
0.5;Shocked by the murder, you canceled \Nyour plans for last night.
0.5;on the same day in another room of \Nthe same hotel, is also unknown.
0.5;And it's true that Amanda \Nvisited Haneda Koji's room.
0.5;Anyway, I'm more interested in \Nthe room that was left ransacked.
0.5;There's something about that \Ncase that interests me.
0.5;Are those scissors that\Namazing of an invention?
0.5;The victim had been spending most \Nof his time in the annex lately
0.5;I'm Professor Agasa's \Nassistant, Okiya Subaru.
0.5;Then he returned to the entrance and \Ntold the bodyguards what happened.
0.5;Why would I do that when \Nyou're not even a cop?
0.5;The scissors' special feature \Nmay have been activated,
0.5;This broken cup is the same as \Nthe one on the counter, right?
0.5;Why didn't you mention \Nsomething so important?
0.5;I had the police share \Nyour call history with me.
0.5;An examination would clear \Nthings up immediately.
0.5;No. The rock used as the weapon \Nwas too heavy to lift in one hand.
0.5;In other words, you were the \Nonly person at the crime scene
0.5;Perhaps I ought to reflect \Non my own actions as well.
0.5;But whenever we get together, \Nwe have a fun time.
0.5;They must be feeling really bad \Nabout the stupid thing they did.
0.5;Who is this Tanuki Ponkichi who \Nkeeps making interesting posts?
0.5;I'm going to find this \Nunlucky man and follow him.
0.5;We'll check in with Otsubo-san and do \Nwhatever it takes to find conclusive evidence.
0.5;Otsubo-san followed unlucky man \NKagura-san for social media fodder.

0.5;I know the circumstances are unusual, \Nbut everyone loved the lecture.
0.5;No, as long as you don't \Nhave a problem with it.
0.5;It's actually about a murder that happened \Nat a certain college one year ago.
0.5;When I was your age, I didn't \Nthink I had any secrets either.

0.5;But from their blindside, as long as you knew \Nwhere they were sitting, it would be possible.

0.5;There was a strange man by that name \Nclaiming to be a medical professional.
0.5;Even though you took off his \Nhead, he's still moving.
0.5;They said we could be in the \NZombie Blade sequel if we passed.

0.5;H-He came back as a zombie and wanted \Nto film himself murdering Kyoko-san.
0.5;Isn't there a window at the end of \Nthe hallway in front of this room?

0.5;Before long,\Nan incident occurred!
0.5;Y-Yes. The only one who left\Nwas Otani, who went to wake her.
0.5;I see. So that's why a call from just\Nthe other room wouldn't be heard.
0.5;That's what I'm saying!\NIt was a suicide!
0.5;Her feet were bare because she\Nwas upset and about to kill herself,
0.5;Hold on, Conan-kun! Where do\Nyou think you're going?! Stop!
0.5;I told you, I'm looking\Nfor something I forgot!
0.5;And only he would\Nstill have proof of it on him!
0.5;I think blood dripped from\Nthe body when we were carrying it...
0.5;and the more developed\Nthe surrounding splatter is.
0.5;Are you saying she\Nwas on top of this shelf?
0.5;Being hanged from that height\Nwould result in an almost instant death.

0.5;the killer directed the others\Ncarrying her body to the blood
0.5;Hold on, now! I wasn't the\Nonly one who left during the party!
0.5;Besides, why would\NI do something so daring
0.5;Wasn't it you who put a\Nmarble under the Fusui-maru
0.5;while she was\Nsleeping during the party.
0.5;Yes, I made the call. But Otani\Ncould have too when he left the room!
0.5;But her cell phone had\Nbeen turned off when it was found.
0.5;by saying that it is either\Nturned off or out of signal range.
0.5;I see. I guess I should've said\NI couldn't get through to her phone.

0.5;Plus he gave some of\Nhis golf balls to his boss.

0.5;Saki-san, there's something \Nwe want to ask you.
0.5;She seems pretty shocked over \Nnearly being in an accident.
0.5;Because she looked like the cousin \NI've hated since I was a child.
0.5;For some reason Miona-chan, daughter \Nof guest house manager Yuri Asako-san,

0.5;When the countdown reaches zero, use your \Ndetective skills to produce an answer!
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;It's unfortunate that both members \Nof the former comedy duo

0.5;Then the reason Otaro-san frequented this \Nguest house where Miona-chan lived...
0.5;I investigated everything \NI could about the case.
0.5;But the window was locked, and the \Ndoor was locked and deadbolted.
0.5;You can lock the door and \Ndeadbolt at the same time.
0.5;then it's not unnatural for a bottle \Nopener to be on the floor, too.
0.5;You must have prepared \Nsome tap water beforehand.
0.5;you intended to return the cow magnet \Nto the dining room before going home.
0.5;The cow magnet was in your \Npocket during this time.

0.5;Genta. Mitsuhiko. Play back all\Nyour footage of Hiroshi-kun!

0.5;So he was kidnapped and\Nbrought here... by the killer!
0.5;but thanks to the weak support struts,\Nthe basement wall crumbled.
0.5;I was watching that\Napartment's veranda.
0.5;But how could he do it\Nfrom so far away?!
0.5;And this is last\Nweek's incident in Harakata.
0.5;That means the second killing\Nwasn't some moron's copycat attack.

0.5;He was my father... The instructor\Nwho died twenty years ago.
0.5;Someday I'd like to open \Na bakery café in Paris.
0.5;Why did Tabata-san bring the \Nsuitcase all the way home with him?
0.5;It's like how some people groom \Nthemselves before committing suicide.
0.5;They did wash the cup to hide \Nthe fact that they came here.
0.5;I'll head to Paris first and \Nfind a location for my café.
0.5;He got that money tricking \Nother women, anyway.
0.5;You just wanted to brag \Nthat he didn't trick you!

0.5;Don't be stupid!\NI'm a 2nd-year high schooler!

0.5;No way. You want to \Ninvestigate for yourselves?

0.5;I was recording at a studio \Nin the city until 12:30.
0.5;I took the train an hour earlier \Nand was walking around the station.
0.5;Shirogane Toru. I'm a writer \Nfor a local magazine.
0.5;Today's stage is a clock manor!\NThe case's alarms all ring together!
0.5;to solve the mysteries concerning\Nstrange events in my home.
0.5;and I've even had the feeling\Nthat I'm being watched lately.
0.5;Yeah. I'm relieved we\Nactually made it to our destination.
0.5;There's a tiger on that pillar,\Nbut not on this one.
0.5;were much better than humans\Nwho fool others out of sheer greed.
0.5;No, our grandfather only\Nmade screw-operated clocks.
0.5;Collie, German Shepherd,\NSiberian Husky, Tosa, Doberman...
0.5;Did his sleeve come\Noff during the struggle?
0.5;Children shouldn't\Nlook at such things.
0.5;So it was the gold's location\Nthat the killer got from Hamada?
0.5;I tried to persuade him,\Nbut he suddenly shot at me...
0.5;You can't ask us to check\Nthe Suigun Cave...
0.5;If Uehara killed Hamada-san,\Nhe must've learned the gold's location.
0.5;The passageway that\Nthe Ryujin-Maru stayed in
0.5;Who cares?! He's probably\Noff playing somewhere!
0.5;So I checked the lighthouse\Nwhile he was gone.
0.5;Yes. I planned to look for\Nthe gold someday at my leisure.
0.5;"I became nervous;\NKogoro Mori is a peerless detective."
0.5;He finally told me about\Nthis place after a bit of pain.
0.5;He brought the Ryujin-Maru\Nin here to escape the storm.
0.5;because he feared someone\Nmight recognize him...
0.5;Wait! Could it be?!\NOnly he could've done it!
0.5;If she was wearing a swimsuit, it \Nmust've been at the pool or the beach.
0.5;I'm going to another \Nparty overseas next week!
0.5;Unlike you, I don't have \Nall the time in the world!
0.5;The woman who died was the one \NConan-kun was talking about?
0.5;Ah, yes, sir. Sashihara \NRitsuko-san, forty-one years old.
0.5;Oh, I'm President Sashihara's \Nemployee, Yamaki.
0.5;They left when they heard there had been a \Nmurder since they didn't want to get involved.
0.5;Yeah. I'm curious about the customer \Nwho left the white sandals, too.
0.5;The killer couldn't have left those marks \Nif they'd closed her hands for her.
0.5;Not even an umbrella would \Nhelp you in this downpour.
0.5;You can stay while it's raining, but \Nyou have to leave once it stops.
0.5;He beautifully dances his \Nmystery-solving steps!
0.5;I'm Amemiya Hideto, the \Nfreeloader who lives here.
0.5;It wouldn't be strange for there \Nto be damage here and there.
0.5;What about the yellow ghost \Nfloating in the room?
0.5;The light never struck this \Nhouse directly before.
0.5;the light started reflecting \Noff the glass windows
0.5;It was probably the lights \Nfrom Hideto-san's car.
0.5;Well? Think you can do \Nit, Holmes' apprentice?
0.5;The eternal rivals, tyrannosaurus \Nand triceratops!
0.5;The director was just assigned \Nto this museum last month.
0.5;That's why we believe the culprit \Ncut most of the wires beforehand,
0.5;and cut the last one when \Nthe director arrived.
0.5;Agasa-san, take those \Nchildren somewhere else.
0.5;I was preparing the fossils \Nfor display... alone.
0.5;The police will find out during \Ntheir investigation anyway.
0.5;he said he'd pay her medical \Nbills if I became his girlfriend.
0.5;That man... When Shida became \Nthe director the museum...
0.5;you gave the audience the impression \Nthat you were onstage the whole time.
0.5;It's because you were eager to frame \NKuchiki-san according to your plan, right?
0.5;Inspector, if no one's seen their face, it \Nwill be impossible to identify the culprit.
0.5;You resented Anna because I \Ndumped you for a younger woman.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the\Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;The professor will worry \Nif we don't get back soon.
0.5;My shoes and tranquilizer watch \Nare both out for repairs!
0.5;Damn it! Isn't there anything \Nwe can use as a weapon?
0.5;I was going to have the \Npatrol officer arrest them
0.5;Sorry, but could someone\Nanswer that for me?
0.5;So he's investigating\Nthe wife's infidelity...
0.5;Why was it necessary\Nto put the body in the bathtub?
0.5;I've prepared the room next to my office,\Nso please make yourselves at home.
0.5;I'm with the police.\NWhat's going on here?
0.5;since you were at the\Nscene when it happened.
0.5;Anyone can easily\Nmake something like this!
0.5;His plan probably\Nstarted when he realized
0.5;You disappoint me.\NYou're a lousy detective.
0.5;Who do you think?\NMrs. Tatsumi, of course.
0.5;but a lot of extra money\Nwas added to my counsel fees.
0.5;I'll keep quiet\Nif you give me 200 million--
0.5;It's against the rules to see \Na hero's face, Conan-kun.
0.5;They kidnapped the real Nobuna \NGaizers, stole their costumes,
0.5;Fortunately, the building manager \Nhad retrieved it for her, but...
0.5;If we find the eight digit number \Nhidden somewhere in this room,
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills \Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;It looks like the origami \NI used to fold as a kid.
0.5;I can make it in time if \NI rush there in a taxi.
0.5;If they love each other, they should \Njust get married right away.
0.5;he got involved in some kind of \Nincident and passed away, right?
0.5;he was robbing Anna-san's apartment, \Nwhich was ten kilometers away.
0.5;But if your testimony is false, \Nthen Hyodo's alibi is undone.
0.5;That's right. Hyodo's accomplice \Nwas the murdered Anna-san.
0.5;But there were thin scratches \Non the nails of Anna-san's body.
0.5;but the truth was revealed \Nby the pet camera footage.
0.5;It was easy for him to talk \Nher into a murder plot.
0.5;Detective Takagi, show Enami-san \Nthe pet camera footage.
0.5;You're accusing me of being an accomplice \Njust because I made a mistake?
0.5;But that was a fake plot intended to \Nhave Anna-san fabricate Hyodo's alibi.
0.5;Hyodo's real aim was to kill \NAnna-san from the start.
0.5;Normally a person would assume one blow to \Nthe head with a gun meant the victim was shot.
0.5;When Hyodo came to the boat where \Nthe gun and clothes were hidden,
0.5;If she's the one who planned this \Nkidnapping, she must know where this is!
0.5;That's why she always shows the left side \Nof her face in every picture she takes.
0.5;It doesn't make sense for her \Nto upload a picture like this.
0.5;Does that mean someone was \Npretending to be Risa-san,
0.5;That's the man who chased \Nme out of the concert hall!
0.5;Yamane-san, why did you have \NTakeyama's phone number?
0.5;They threw away the refrigerator they \Ntrapped Ran-neechan inside there, too.
0.5;Very well. We'll start making \Npreparations immediately.
0.5;But to me, my daughter is \Nan irreplaceable treasure.
0.5;I don't know that it will, but if \Nthere's evidence on Ran's phone,
0.5;That was a phone call from the \Ndirector Sakuta-san, right?
0.5;Y-Yeah. I was worried because we were \Nabout to start and I didn't see Bianca.
0.5;I thought it would be easy to fool \NTakeyama since he came to all her events,
0.5;I-I'm not tricking anybody. I'm just \Ntelling you about some great loans.
0.5;♪ When told to cry,\NI laughed instead ♪
0.5;Don't talk all big when\Nyou never even listen to 'em!
0.5;Yeah, but my partner,\N Shiina-kun, hasn't shown up,
0.5;Why don't you try\Ncalling him from here?
0.5;Say, when did\Nthis harassment start?
0.5;That's a bad idea.\NConan-kun is tone-deaf!
0.5;My friend, Professor Agasa,\Nmade it for me!
0.5;Where are you?!\NThey already started tuning up!
0.5;These kids claim Takayama\NMinami-san was kidnapped!
0.5;We're gonna get wet if\Nthey don't start soon...
0.5;...and was wearing\Na ski hat and a scarf!
0.5;Inspector, he wants to talk\Nto the officer in charge.
0.5;Guess I'll turn Two-Mix into\NOne-Mix and then get back to you.
0.5;We can't just sit around while\NTwo-Mix is being held captive!
0.5;We'll rescue them before the\Nconcert starts, so just hold on!
0.5;Plus, with four kids, they'll assume\Nthey'll never lose sight of 'em.
0.5;Who did he say\Nto give the tape to?!
0.5;but was killed when it went\Noff during the struggle...
0.5;I'm pretty sure the man was\Nacquitted for self-defense reasons...
0.5;OK! You watch the kids!\NWe're heading for the bag!
0.5;No, there doesn't\Nseem to be anyone...
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Anyway, Tokugawa's buried treasure \Nis at Mt. Akagi in Gunma.
0.5;There are other non-high \Nschool aged detectives.
0.5;Yes, well, I also invited \Nhistorians and archaeologists,
0.5;The lake is just past the \Ntrees so it's a bit dangerous,
0.5;and meet at the cave at the \Nexcavation site in the morning?
0.5;in the Tale of Heike sounded \Nsimilar to the bird's,
0.5;Yeah. I'll drink it from the \Nbottle, so I don't need a glass.
0.5;If you want to open the \Ndrawer, open it already.
0.5;In that case, Dobashi-san, \Nlook after Princess Reina.
0.5;He said there are lots of other \Npeople who resent Ryo-san.
0.5;which would be unaffected \Nby the wind and waves.
0.5;You asked someone at the office to \Ncall you at a predetermined time.
0.5;I wasn't feeling well that day and \Nhad someone judge in my place.
0.5;High school student Shinichi was forced\Nto take a pill that shrunk him!
0.5;We have to use chocolate\Nto capture men's hearts!
0.5;Hello there, Ran-san!\NI've been looking for you!
0.5;Of course. The party is taking place\Nat his house, after all.
0.5;Don't be stupid! Who would actually\Nlike that big mystery geek?!
0.5;Oh, right! Who knows,\NShinichi might just come back!
0.5;I have no choice but to find out\Nwhere that chocolate winds up!
0.5;to our guests, Ran Mori-san\Nand Sonoko Suzuki-san!
0.5;Knock it off.\NI only want to be friends.
0.5;All we have to do is check the rest\Nof your chocolate to prove it!
0.5;Yes, there are ways\Nto poison cigarettes...
0.5;So I put poison\Nin the cigarette filter!
0.5;Seeing Susumu-kun drink\Nthe poisoned coffee,
0.5;you decided to use the fact that\NYoshimi-san loved him to your advantage!
0.5;You knew without question that\Nhe would eat her chocolate.
0.5;You don't usually get assistants \Nthis late in the year.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Sorry for making you help \Nme during your lunch break.
0.5;Oh, the principal mentioned \Nthat they couldn't
0.5;In any case, let's get inside \Nand look for the lime.
0.5;It was tied to the old storage \Nshed behind the school.
0.5;In other words, as long as you \Nhave rods of the same size,
0.5;Even if I change the thickness of \Nthe pen, I still can't read it.
0.5;There's Mon, Tues, Wed, \NThurs, Fri, Sat, and Sun.
0.5;And then there's this \Nhomeroom period on Tuesday.
0.5;We'll put out a BOLO for \Nhim as a murder suspect!
0.5;who talked Shingen into forming \Nan alliance with Oda Nobunaga.
0.5;He probably used it because \Nthey had similar builds.
0.5;around Lieutenant Kano's neck \Nbecause of Detective Akiyama, too.
0.5;See? The upper and lower loops \Nswitch in the blink of an eye.
0.5;Even parasites inside a \Nlion will eat their host.
0.5;Then you set a trap to \Nframe me using that rope.
0.5;since you were still hanging \Nfrom the tree on the cliff.
0.5;Come to think of it, I saw a story \Nabout that on the village's website.
0.5;That's right. I came here \Nbecause I saw the same story.
0.5;You sure do get caught up \Nin a lot of cases, too.
0.5;but they are slightly \Nmore acidic than normal.
0.5;People say cyanide compounds \Nkill when they're swallowed,
0.5;adding acid to a cyanide compound \Ncreates a poisonous gas.
0.5;Once the acid is added, the \Npoisonous gas would be released.
0.5;The acid was added not by the \Nculprit, but by Ogami-san himself.
0.5;With this method, even if someone \Nentered the bathroom before him,
0.5;There is. There's one \Npiece of solid evidence.
0.5;The only thing you should be doing is \Nshowing remorse and atoning for your crimes!
0.5;Yes, yes! Kinoshita Akiko-san\Nand Asanuma Yoko-san, yes?
0.5;Does our room have\Na view of a persimmon tree?
0.5;that a pile of snow\Nlooked like her to you!
0.5;It's already 10:00.\NThe owners are asleep now.
0.5;She says her father\Nsuffered from the same illness...
0.5;A person seeking out death\Nwouldn't wear clothes so brazenly.
0.5;Would someone at night,\Nand someone about to commit suicide,
0.5;Yesterday, you gave her\Nthe sedative to knock her out.
0.5;You then put her in her Snow\NWoman outfit and left her outside.
0.5;As a stuntwoman,\Nthat would be simple to do.
0.5;The final touch was the\NSnow Woman that Ran saw from the bath.
0.5;If Akiko-san was dead,\Njust who brought the whiskey?!
0.5;But you had the\Nmechanical doll bring it.
0.5;When I thought I'd always be her\Ndouble as long as she was around...
0.5;The Milky Way refers to the \Nband of stars in the sky,
0.5;Not here, but the same flowerbeds are on the \Nroof of the Yoshimura building behind ours.
0.5;But, Sonoko, did Sasaki-san have any \Ntime to go to the neighboring building?
0.5;If Minakami-san came down \Nwhile Sasaki-san was gone,
0.5;She was working on the \Nthird floor after that.
0.5;The culprit is the person who was suddenly \Nasked to return to the Sasaki building.
0.5;In their desperation, they remembered \Nthe flowerbed on the roof,
0.5;Most people don't have total\Nconfidence in their own memory.
0.5;Plenty of people will say they don't recognize\Nsomeone by name even when they've met.
0.5;"My nickname is ""Zero,"" so I\Nthought someone was calling me."
0.5;I thought my son had a simple cold during\Nhis exams, but it turned out to be the flu.
0.5;Then that means those three had the\Nopportunity to poison the victim.
0.5;by switching their own\Npoisoned cup with the victim's.
0.5;Everyone knows I like herb tea, so\NI had received quite a few as gifts.
0.5;"I was drinking a blue herb\Ntea called ""Butterfly Tea."""
0.5;We lined them up on the table\Nand chose what we wanted.
0.5;She took him from me.\NShe took him from me!
0.5;and he didn't have time to worry\Nabout the entrance exam anymore.
0.5;but Reina had always been that\Nway, so we just dealt with it.
0.5;Guess I'll tune up the skateboard\Nthe professor gave me.
0.5;After all, we're destined\Nto be together!
0.5;Is it filled with\Ngrilled eel lunches?!
0.5;But what's this thing?\NIt's slippery!
0.5;I can't just sit here\Nwhile Ayumi-chan is in danger!
0.5;We can't leave her alive!\NEven if she is just a kid!
0.5;This is bad! There's no catching them\Nif they get on the freeway!
0.5;Hey! Beika Bridge is straight\Ndown that last street!
0.5;They'll find Ayumi-chan\Nbefore they get caught!
0.5;"I heard someone say, ""Welcome,""\Nand this weird sound just started!"
0.5;We don't need any!\NWe're in a hurry!
0.5;Yeah! You said you'd have\Nno trouble killing little kids!
0.5;Have the preparations for Heiji-kun's \Nvictory party been made?
0.5;Come to think of it, after \Nyesterday's team match,
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""Kendo \NTournament of Love and Mystery, Part Two!"""
0.5;The initial suspect, neighborhood association \Npresident Bando Hikoichi-san, was also murdered.
0.5;Inspector, you think it's \Nstrange, too, don't you?
0.5;you planned to escape by saying \Nyou'd never have chosen an awl
0.5;Is there some reason she doesn't \Nwant to be investigated?
0.5;Chino-san, do you remember \Nanything about that story?
0.5;to quickly kill him like \NAmagi-san and Bando-san.
0.5;But Bando-san couldn't have \Ncommitted the murders at night.
0.5;But the true identity of the person \Nwho killed Amagi-san and Bando-san,
0.5;left behind Chino-san's lighter \Nthey got that afternoon,
0.5;They provoked the detectives into following \Nthe scenario they had concocted...
0.5;I question the character of \Nanyone capable of writing that.
0.5;the poison seeps through their \Nskin, and they suffocate to death.
0.5;There was one four days ago, \Nand another two days ago.
0.5;But he was only near the \Nscene of the crime yesterday.
0.5;It's still pretty bright since \Nthere's a high-rise apartment.
0.5;They're both left-handed, but she's the \None who could drive that van, not him.
0.5;A year and a half ago, a child playing \Nat the park was badly injured
0.5;and looks like a kid but\Nhas the mind of an adult!
0.5;Next, Tadokoro-san went to the\Nstudy to deliver the wine and movie.
0.5;The wine bottle's\Nseal hasn't been broken.
0.5;Yes. I believe I returned\Nten minutes afterward.
0.5;Yes. I returned to the\Nliving room at about 10:30.
0.5;Quit joking around! Why would\NI need to kill Dorakura-sensei?!
0.5;Even if it was possible, the study\Nroom was locked from the inside.
0.5;His wife does oil painting, so it\Nwould've been easy to get the paint.
0.5;And if he left through the window,\Nhow did he return to the corridor?
0.5;There were no other footprints,\Nexcept those in front of the window.
0.5;W-What are you talking about?\NHow could a projector do that?
0.5;it was absolutely vital to move\Nthe projector in front of the door.
0.5;But, the trick would be obvious\Nif only the projector were moved.
0.5;So, by lighting up the body as\Na bit of an informed performance,
0.5;Next, stick a piece of\Ntape on the end of the film.
0.5;Tadokoro-san, can you\Ngive any other explanation
0.5;as to why that perforation-marked\Ntape was stuck on the curtain rail?
0.5;At the time, you said\Nyou could hear the projector.
0.5;Something's not right!\NWhat could it be?!
0.5;they visited her grandmother's home, \Nwhere they found a mysterious message.
0.5;Right now at this moment, \Nlight pierces the darkness!
0.5;If you match the doll's \Nbase to this square mark...
0.5;before school in order to look for the \Ntreasure she hid, but you couldn't find her.
0.5;This bird-like doll to \Nthe right of the arrow?
0.5;There's a glass cup with \Na toothbrush on the sink.
0.5;but I can't get through because \Nof the commotion next door.
0.5;on the other side of the door is \Nwarmer than the hallway you're in.
0.5;Our teacher did just tell us \Nnot to respond to reporters
0.5;"""We don't want this case \Nto go to his head."""
0.5;As a low-ranking member, the only thing I \Nknow is that the organization's color is black.
0.5;Because another man had picked \Nup the phone before he did.
0.5;The old man would worry \Nthat the phone's radio waves
0.5;The coating on his fingers \Nmade them slippery.
0.5;The man who was shot always \Nwore a black knit hat.
0.5;He could easily create a device that would\Nshoot blood out when a blank was fired.
0.5;Clench your teeth so you \Ndon't bite your tongue!
0.5;is a bestselling author for his \Nfirst attempt at a screenplay.
0.5;The car's shaking because \Nthe tire's losing air.
0.5;chairman of a corporate group, \Nwho died three days earlier,
0.5;B-But if that's true, then \Nhe's headed towards...
0.5;to say he might be attending \Nthe funeral with Asada-sensei.
0.5;He said it's inside a \Nsmall paulownia wood box.
0.5;The three of you likely \Ncolluded on the condition
0.5;You hid the will in an unused \Nhearse along with Conan-kun,
0.5;There's no way she could \Nhave committed the crime.
0.5;The turtle made you think \Nthe two homes were one.
0.5;She thought she would\Nmake a perfect witness.
0.5;A racing second hand,\Na shining comet!
0.5;He can't help it.\NDad's a popular novelist.
0.5;I see. So you're the one\Nshe shamelessly sent to me.
0.5;They're all wonderful youngsters,\Nand all three live with us
0.5;He might be helpful!\NHe knows all sorts of unusual things!
0.5;Probably because he\Nwasn't the type to commit suicide.
0.5;Why, you! You ripped up\Nimportant evidence!
0.5;See? He used cards\Nwith different patterns just now.
0.5;He'd never normally\Ndo this. He's a perfectionist...
0.5;So, what exactly is\Nthis basement room?
0.5;Come to think of it,\Na policeman did say
0.5;the body seemed a bit odd\Nfor someone who was poisoned.
0.5;You know, like what\Nthey use in magic tricks.
0.5;If there was such a mark,\Nthe cops would've found it long ago!
0.5;The police found that number too,\Nbut it was nonsense,
0.5;The police are right.\NIt was the daughter playing around.
0.5;I took our daughter\Nto the show that day,
0.5;If it were me, I think I'd try to\Nleave a clue about who did it...
0.5;it would be clear the phone was\Nunplugged if someone tried to use it.
0.5;All that's left is to decipher\Nthis strange number message, but...
0.5;Wait a minute! Then the\Nnext one, 3-2-4-8-9 is C!
0.5;Yes. She probably plans\Nto kill your daughter.
0.5;Ayano! Mako-san!\NWhere are you? Ayano!
0.5;But, why would Mako-san\Nkill my husband?!
0.5;She must have some\Nconnection with that man.
0.5;You know, the man with the\Nblack hat in that one photograph.
0.5;I saw her when I went to\Nthe basement room one night.
0.5;I never saw Mako cut the string\Non his rings or plug the phone back in.
0.5;I see. So you became his\Npupil to avenge your brother.
0.5;You can have my life.\NJust keep my daughter out of this!
0.5;He naively let me tie his rings\Ntogether to show me a new trick,
0.5;It's alright! I'm going\Nto live with you for a while!
0.5;Yep! My second son, Conan!\NI had him in Los Angeles!
0.5;Was it Uncle Yoshifusa\Nwho you wanted us to investigate?!
0.5;Then, shouldn't\Nhe still have that scar?
0.5;the faces of the buffoons\Nwho would send such a letter.
0.5;Now, if you're finished here,\Nthen get the hell out!
0.5;See? He has a mitt on his right hand.\NProof that he's left-handed.
0.5;She disappeared one day fifteen\Nyears ago, after a very heavy snowfall.
0.5;Our mother stood on the edge of\Nthe well to pick a flower, but slipped.
0.5;I leave the rest to you,\NHiromi-san!
0.5;J-Just now! There was a weird man\Nwith sunglasses behind the gate!
0.5;Could it be the suspicious man\Nwith sunglasses you just saw?!
0.5;You're sure she's the\Nsecond wife of Yoshichika-san,
0.5;She was at a friend's after-wedding\Nparty at the hotel by the station,
0.5;Yep! I was the only one not with them,\Nbecause I was in the bath!
0.5;So, I'm not good\Naround dead bodies...
0.5;Plus, it still has gas, and\Ndoesn't seem to have any flat tires...
0.5;What's most curious of all is the\Nbody that was tied to the well rope.
0.5;Yes. The killer still\Nhasn't been caught,
0.5;T-The cabinet! An arrow\Ncame out of that cabinet!
0.5;...had tried to target you,\NUncle Yoshifusa.
0.5;I don't think so. He barely dodged\Nit after reacting to Conan's voice.
0.5;until we learn\Nwho that strange person is...
0.5;It seems she had indeed been there,\Nbut they're not sure when she left.
0.5;Come to think of it, Hiromi\Ndid say something strange.
0.5;And her killer was the one\Nwho blurted out something odd!
0.5;with the hidden bow gun\Nthat was aimed at Mr. Yoshifusa.
0.5;I could pay it all off\Nwithout you ever knowing.
0.5;I just wanted to scare\Nhim enough to return to Brazil.
0.5;Hey, now! You heard that she\Ncalled from the hotel at 9:00 last night!
0.5;Just after 9:00, she parked\Nthe car in the woods
0.5;To make it seem as\Nif she was still at the party.
0.5;That clearly indicates\Nsomeone had attacked him before.
0.5;Just like Keiko-san,\Nwho had set up the arrow.
0.5;I assume he tied the body to the\Nwell rope and made it easy to spot
0.5;Yusaku-san! \NWhat are you doing here?
0.5;He's left-handed,\Nand his handwriting matched!
0.5;You're exactly right.\NYou didn't get a single thing wrong.
0.5;I would've known the\Nold man wasn't the real deal
0.5;But that old man's\Nscar was on his right leg.
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills \Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;Tell Edogawa-kun to call \Nme if you hear from him.
0.5;You're already looking into \Nour alibis, huh? Interesting.
0.5;Are you happy you're being \Ntreated like a criminal?
0.5;Can't a detective like you get the police \Nor phone company to look into it?
0.5;Early this morning I received a \Nphone call from him at my house.
0.5;And before you ask, I called \Nfrom my house phone, too.
0.5;We were invited to the\Nbirthday party of Uchida Asami,
0.5;Luckily, Ran broke down the\Ndoor and managed to save her!
0.5;"""I'm sorry! I'm sorry,\NKudo-kun! I'm so sorry!"""
0.5;If so, then Morimoto-san would be\Nmost suspicious, as he had the key!
0.5;According to the witnesses,\Nthe fire started around 2:50.
0.5;The cake with the lit candles\Nwas sitting on a chair!
0.5;Yeah. The chair was burnt up,\Nand the cake turned to goop.
0.5;In front of that small,\Ncharred cabinet in the corner.
0.5;A brown-haired guy with\Nglasses, a girl in a black dress,
0.5;It'd take fifteen minutes\Nto run from there to here.
0.5;and the motorcycle\Nwas parked by this lodge.
0.5;and could be controlled\Nfrom a remote location?
0.5;Oh, I see. It's set up like\Nthe living room before the fire.
0.5;You went to the convenience\Nstore to buy cigarettes at that time...
0.5;set up the trick just now while\Neveryone was getting ready to leave,
0.5;What's more, you faxed that copy\Nfrom the convenience store later.
0.5;The copy that had the\Nmessage and cake cream on it.
0.5;Yes. He should still\Nhave it on him somewhere...
0.5;A fax with Professor Takamura's\Nmessage and cake cream on it!
0.5;I see. Only someone who knew\Nwhere the fire was could've said that.
0.5;Just a small fire?!\NIt spread faster than you thought?!
0.5;Do you think those\Nserve as excuses?! You idiot!
0.5;The car could've gotten into an accident!\NIt could've gotten a flat tire!
0.5;I bet you could capture any\Nman with a single breath, though.
0.5;But one day, I shared some\Nlemon pie I made with the soccer club.
0.5;He said this while\Nacting embarrassed...
0.5;"""Tonight the world's largest \Nmoonstone, Luna Memoria,"
0.5;I doubt you'd be able to open \Na Samizu Kichiemon trick box.
0.5;he offered me front row tickets \Nto an Okino Yoko concert?
0.5;Its beautiful moonlight blue \Nluster is a true example of—
0.5;and found my husband in the study \Nopening the box, admiring the contents,
0.5;He couldn't have foreseen that \Nand hidden the paper elsewhere.
0.5;Apparently he secretly \Nopened it while I was out.
0.5;Even heaven is watching the \Nlabyrinths of the world!
0.5;Full throttle reasoning skills \Npenetrate all mysteries!
0.5;Then you found the dead woman in \Nthe bedroom and called the police.
0.5;He was stabbed multiple times \Nin the chest with a sharp blade.
0.5;We've already confirmed this \Ninformation with his brokerage firm.
0.5;But since that person entering and exiting \Nthe building was caught on camera,
0.5;when she tried to take off \Nthe tape when she found her.
0.5;I think I dropped the envelope \Nwith the reward money somewhere.
0.5;"The next episode of Conan is ""The Shifting \NMystery of Beika City, Part One!"""
0.5;The deduction catches fire \Non the line to the heart.
0.5;He's right. Kuranishi-kun may \Nbe worried about her, but...
0.5;You shouldn't run away with someone's \Nphone without their permission.
0.5;She left a note saying she had to go \Nto Yamashiro to confess something.
0.5;The assault of an elderly person and \Ntheft of five million yen in cash
0.5;and there is a plus sign between \Nonly these two symbols.
0.5;I found it on my pillow when \NI woke up this morning.
0.5;You're so dumb!\NIt's obviously Shinichi-kun!
0.5;So that's why I always\Ngot the answering machine.
0.5;How they'd all like to\Nhear from the peerless detective!
0.5;"for the ""Newcomer Award""\Nher novel won the other day."
0.5;Huh? Asami-kun said she was\Ngoing to make one and bring it here...
0.5;Once you eat it, you can't tell\Nwhat it looks like anyway!
0.5;Let's save the cake for tomorrow\Nand go do karaoke ourselves.
0.5;He's still walking around\Nthe train station to sober up.
0.5;Maybe we should head back.\NWe left the place messy, too.
0.5;Let's hurry to the lodge!\NWe might still make it in time!
0.5;Should we call her on the phone?!\NShe was asleep in the living room!
0.5;Nothing at all...\NI rushed inside without thinking...
0.5;Nothing beats drinking\Nbeer with old friends!
0.5;Ikuta and I agreed to\Nmeet up here at 10:00 pm.
0.5;With that light broken,\NI could barely even see Ikuta...
0.5;My name's Takeno. I'm a\N2nd-year student along with Ikuta.
0.5;Around what time\Ndid Ikuta-san step outside?
0.5;Takeno had asked him to buy\Nsnacks at the convenience store.
0.5;Didn't you say Ikuta\Ntook your money?
0.5;Say, why did you have the lights\Noff if you were writing a report?
0.5;Omura-san's apartment is\Ndirectly below Takeno-san's!
0.5;Ikuta-san was standing\Nhere in the dark.
0.5;Yes. It was absent\Nfrom the scene of the crime.
0.5;directly above\Nthe bloodstain on the wall.
0.5;to shoot the rock onto\Nthe other building's roof.
0.5;Kusaka-san never\Ncalled anyone. It was all an act.
0.5;Wouldn't that make it harder\Nto know where he'd be?!
0.5;Which means there's a plastic\Nbag full of rocks still in here!
0.5;and took up her invitation\Nto stay at a lodge.
0.5;Yes. A cell phone kept\Nringing in his room next door.
0.5;I heard it from my\Nroom across the hall, too!
0.5;I'm just a woman who can't\Ndo anything for her students.
0.5;You were in charge of\Nthe volleyball club she was in.
0.5;You could've stopped her\Nfrom committing suicide, too...
0.5;Murder mystery?! Don't tell\Nme someone's been killed?!
0.5;In any case,\Nit's dangerous to be split up!
0.5;If my name gets into the paper,\Nthey'll find out I'm alive!
0.5;That is an interesting trick,\Nbut would it really work that well?
0.5;Alright, li'l lady. If one of us\Nis the killer, then let's hear about
0.5;So, the killer was\None of us three upstairs?!
0.5;Yes. The one who murdered\NSugiyama-sensei and Shimoda-sensei
0.5;attacking from behind,\Nand knocking her out,
0.5;But, I only wore it to hide\Nmy hair after I cut it too short.
0.5;Remember? There were scratch\Nmarks on Shimoda-sensei's neck.
0.5;This time three years ago,\Nshe came to me.
0.5;I'm sorry for being\Nsuch a horrible teacher...
0.5;but nothing good\Nhas ever happened to me...
0.5;And, you're as stunning as\Never with that long hair!
0.5;The teacher for Class 5-1,\NShimoda-sensei...
0.5;A music teacher\Nwho wound up coming, too.
0.5;You usually organize our trips,\Nso I thought you did this one, too...
0.5;Was it this handkerchief?\NPeople on TV do it a lot,
0.5;See? There are\Nrope marks on her neck.
0.5;Maybe the culprit\Nis trying to tell you that?
0.5;so I went out the back\Nto check the gas tanks.
0.5;But, I'll never forget what\Nhappened three years ago.
0.5;But we didn't have access to personal \Ninformation like the student roster.
0.5;there were countless possibilities \Nlike Tae, Takako, Tamami, and Toshiko.
0.5;You shouldn't read people's \Nletters, Conan-kun.
0.5;Maybe the initials on the \Nletters have something to do
0.5;They only cared about \Ntheir house's reputation.
0.5;Eimi-chan, why did you have us \Nmeet today at that time and place?
0.5;You deliberately had us come on time so \Nyou could show us the act you put on.
0.5;the knife into the flowerbed\Nat that time from that location.
0.5;"I expected him to say something \Nlike ""don't be stupid."""
0.5;was attended by 13 people, \Nor because the number 13
0.5;And in the darkness, someone inside \Nthe store stabbed the victim.
0.5;of the victim's three friends \Nor the other customer.
0.5;with the body of a child \Nand the mind of an adult,
0.5;Just write about whatever \Nyou want to eat that day.
0.5;What does Kaneko-san plan to do \Nby stocking something this nice?
0.5;If I got that much money,\NI'd take my family to Hawaii.
0.5;the jewel thief was trying to steal the \Nbig shiny watch from Jewelry Kaneko.
0.5;I'm handing out these fliers \Nto alert the locals.
0.5;The store window where the watch is \Ndisplayed is made of tempered glass,
0.5;You should also consider the possibility \Nthat the jeweler might pretend to rob himself.
0.5;and invited her and her family to Hawaii \Nby lying and telling her she'd won a prize.
0.5;He deduced that the culprit \Nmust know a lot about the area
0.5;He's really a great detective \Nwho can solve any case, right?
0.5;My recipes are the product \Nof my own creativity.
0.5;He clearly recognized those gloves \Nbecause he always wears them.
0.5;As long as Nonaka-san doesn't come \Nup with an alibi, it must be him.
0.5;Considering their testimony,\Nit sounds like the culprit is...
0.5;You headed towards the men's \Nbathroom and attacked Tomita-san,
0.5;I understand that I could've gone to \Nthe bathroom and back in three minutes.
0.5;You got caught on the nail sticking out \Nof the wall on your way back, didn't you?
0.5;It's the same color cloth \Nas Sakai-san's uniform.
0.5;the old man and I tracked down the thief \Nwho burglarized the Oide family home
0.5;The culprit hid somewhere and \Nwatched to see what he'd do.
0.5;In other words, she could've \Nacquired some sleeping pills.
0.5;Maybe there's something \Nhe wants her help with.
0.5;On the day of the incident, when \Nthe two of you returned home,
0.5;Fusaya leaving home must \Nhave really come as a shock.
0.5;What time did you receive \Nthat final phone call?
0.5;Soho Kuremi-san, after running \Ninto your former classmate,
0.5;In other words, Raita must've fallen asleep \Nimmediately afterwards just past 4 PM.
0.5;Although I did receive a bunch \Nof money in compensation.
0.5;I held onto that information so \Nthe family would owe me a favor.
0.5;That means my deduction \Nis fundamentally wrong.
0.5;We got into a scuffle, and \NI threw my father off of me.
0.5;Yes. More importantly, what do \Nyou mean, there's no culprit?
0.5;However, they then rapidly lose \Nconsciousness and die shortly later.
0.5;That's when the acute \Nepidural hematoma developed.
0.5;and helped your other family \Nmembers look for you,
0.5;Taking public transportation \Nis good luck? Yeah, right.
0.5;A sad reality lurks within \Na studio of dreams!
0.5;Maybe the power shut off because he \Ndropped the remote when he was attacked.
0.5;If that were the case, the power would \Nhave gone out after Hanyu-san screamed.
0.5;We'll begin thoroughly searching \Nthe entire studio for the culprit.
0.5;Once you've gotten that through \Nyour head, go do your job.
0.5;And the mystery is on\Nthe national treasure level!
0.5;and looks like a kid\Nbut has the mind of an adult!
0.5;Yeah, that optimistic personality\Nis on the national treasure level...
0.5;when I forgot to file an article\Nfrom the other day about a case of his!
0.5;Please, pull yourself\Ntogether, Seto-san!
0.5;You're to be the sixth-generation\NKikuemon, after all!
0.5;Any uncertainty in the heart\Nsoon shows up in earthenware.
0.5;No matter. All that has\Nshape will someday break.
0.5;Mori-san! It's morning!\NMori-san!
0.5;That's odd. Where could she\Nhave gone this early in the morning?
0.5;But would anyone use\Nsuch important works of art?
0.5;There's blood everywhere\Nbecause she probably writhed around.
0.5;She broke it yesterday when\Nshe came to get it from the storeroom.
0.5;Now that you mention it,\Nthe bottoms of her feet aren't dirty!
0.5;And the lady cops didn't \Nshow up until a while later.
0.5;While I was chasing him, \Nthe culprit threw a hose at me.
0.5;Always determining the one truth with the \Nbody of a child and the mind of an adult,
0.5;Yumi-san and I flanked the culprit \Nwho was running down the street
0.5;in front of this shop and \Nchased him into here.
0.5;Anyway, is there anything \Nyou haven't told me
0.5;they were making a weird sound \Nwith every step they took.
0.5;So why did you sit at a seat \Nthat had so little soy sauce?
0.5;doesn't mean he'd check how much soy \Nsauce is left at each seat beforehand.
0.5;There was a murder in this \Nneighborhood last week.
0.5;She hit her head on the stairs \Nin the entryway and died.
0.5;They even performed a body \Ncheck on the three suspects,
0.5;It's possible that Mary is \NSera Masumi's real name.
0.5;Conan's logic is good medicine\Nfor hearts dried by modern society!
0.5;She had snuck out to look for her\Nmissing partner, Nagano Shiina-san.
0.5;No, there doesn't\Nseem to be anyone...
0.5;There was a murder near that\Ntemple when the bell rang at 11:50...
0.5;...with his hand on the gun, to leave\Nbehind traces of gunpowder!
0.5;I assume you heard the radio show\Nthe demo tape was played on.
0.5;Never expected someone to hear\Nthe shots and make a song about it...
0.5;that some kids had called\N110 and asked for you.
0.5;See! Told you this\NEarring Cell Phone was useful!
0.5;Hurry! We can still\Nget to the concert in time!
0.5;♪ Realize the quivering \Ntruth in my eyes ♪
0.5;♪ What I felt when I was\N with you wasn't weakness ♪
0.5;♪ it was a kind of serenity that\Nmade up for something I lacked ♪
0.5;I was going to pin it on her when \Nwe went to preschool today,
0.5;Could you get the colored \Npaper and cardboard?
0.5;I was going to have her make a \Ncherry blossom badge for me.
0.5;Raise your hand when you're \Nwalking in a crosswalk.
0.5;Weren't you going to\NOkino Yoko's concert today, Dad?
0.5;Shaddup. I don't feel\Nlike hearing that from you,
0.5;100 million yen?\NCould that buy a boxed eel lunch?
0.5;Shut up! If you don't wanna die,\Nhit the floor and stay there!
0.5;A-Are you aware that\NMori Kogoro is in that room?!
0.5;She's having a blast.\NShould I put her on?
0.5;How long does it take\Nto borrow a stupid wheelchair?!
0.5;It's all you guys' fault\Nif I miss Yoko-chan's singing!
0.5;by making it look like you worked\Nat the bank as a spy for them.
0.5;That's the story, based on what\Nthe inspector also said in the bathroom.
0.5;A long-haired woman wearing a \Nred raincoat and red boots.
0.5;the gaiety of summer for a stylish \Nand dashing display of deduction.
0.5;Sumika said she'd have them \Nprinted and bring them here.
0.5;Sumika's shy. She's always \Nlike that around new people.
0.5;You could make good\Nmoney off these burgers.
0.5;Sera-no-neechan, you're \Ngood with a fork and knife.
0.5;does that mean the woman in red we\Nsaw in the forest earlier is your fifth?
0.5;so we decided to go looking \Nfor her in the forest.
0.5;D-Do you want Sera-san \Nto catch this Red Woman?
0.5;Shopping and carrying \Nthings around is my job.
0.5;We should have cleaned \Nup a little before lunch.
0.5;Well, considering that \Nincident happened nearby,
0.5;In that case, could you help \Nme clean the other rooms?
0.5;But how will he escape his dangerous \Nsituation in this suspenseful story?
0.5;That sounds like something \Nthat wicked woman would do.
0.5;Stop asking for instructions \Nover every little thing!
0.5;And a detective can find \Nthe robber, solve the case,
0.5;The problem is yesterday morning \Nafter he checked out of the inn.
0.5;It takes thirty minutes\Nto get from Yonago
0.5;where the flower park and \Nhot spring are to Kurayoshi.
0.5;Not only are the police waiting to \Ncatch him when you make the exchange,
0.5;Kotani Yasunobu-san, made\Nhis silent return home today.
0.5;I bet she cheated on\Nyou once she got popular!
0.5;You two used to argue nearly\Nevery day about her acting!
0.5;Swallowing cyanide means\Na near-instant death!
0.5;What are you doing?\NYou haven't improved one bit!
0.5;I said to stay where you were\Nuntil we're done investigating!
0.5;The case is closed,\Nall thanks to him.
0.5;Tateoka-san peeked as she\Nwas changing clothes...
0.5;I just thought I'd injure\Nher by rigging the curtain...
0.5;How did the killer slip\NShoko-san the cyanide?
0.5;It was definitely added moments\Nbefore she drank the water.
0.5;This is your fault\Nfor using that broad!
0.5;Oh yeah! I know someone\Nwho's perfect for the role!
0.5;This situation was\Na little different...
0.5;Plus nobody could accurately get\Nit into the cup from up there!
0.5;The one where Buddha tries to\Nsave thieves in Hell by lowering a--
0.5;In order to face off against \NKid, whose target is the jewel,
0.5;Kid was able to steal the pearl \Nfrozen inside a block of ice.
0.5;"The thief left a card saying ""the \Njewel is mine"" and vanished."
0.5;But there's still about four hours \Nbefore the trains start running.
0.5;Then let's take a nap in \Nthe museum somewhere.
0.5;Looks like I'll have to cover \Nthat ridiculous mouth...
0.5;and that you were drawn to the \Npearl's unique orient effect?
0.5;Yeah, at least I noticed this \None was fake right away.
0.5;The fake Kazuha didn't have \Nany seaweed in her teeth!
0.5;Come to think of it, weren't Date-san \Nand Matsuda-san in the same class?
0.5;There's a black stain around \Nthe inside of the hole,
0.5;then he was probably working \Nfor the Public Security Agency
0.5;It'll display the location of this\Ntransmitter within a 20-kilometer radius.
0.5;Wow! This is my first time\Nat a race track!
0.5;We don't want to scare him away\Nand then lose him!
0.5;He's the man who was hanging out\Nby Hirota-san's apartment!
0.5;Wait right here! I'll go catch him\Nand find out where Masami-san is!
0.5;He asked me to find his brother\Nwho left Kyushu for Tokyo.
0.5;But why did the transmitter on\NMasami-san's watch lead me there?!
0.5;Stop rushing me! Being impatient\Nisn't going to help you any!
0.5;Definitely! I saw him go in\Non my way home from school!
0.5;Masami-san, Kenzo Hirota,\Nand Akira Hirota...
0.5;Eager to catch Hirota-san,\Nthe two partners concocted lies
0.5;Her hairstyle and overall\Nappearance were different,
0.5;What he had in brute strength\Nhe lacked in intelligence.
0.5;There's no doubt that he\Nwould alert the authorities
0.5;This guy intended to kill everyone\Nfrom the very start, didn't he?
0.5;Sumika-san probably wasn't attacked by \NTamami-san dressed as the Red Woman.
0.5;The ghost of the Red \NWoman you keep mentioning...
0.5;who was out shopping at a \Nstore one kilometer away.
0.5;That's right. It's true that Sumika-san was \Ncleaning the second floor the whole time.
0.5;She knocked him unconscious by striking \Nhim with a dumbbell from behind.
0.5;she had the girls confirm there \Nwas nothing floating in the tub.
0.5;Your sleeves that were soaked in incredibly \Nsalty water have dried, leaving behind...
0.5;I thought you were suspicious \Nsince we first met, though.
0.5;and you were eavesdropping \Non our conversation then.
0.5;They probably got lost and couldn't \Nfind where they agreed to meet,
0.5;because she was attacked\Nby her and ran away.
0.5;If the Red Woman herself fell into \Nthe swamp immediately after she ran,
